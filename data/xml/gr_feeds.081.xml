They’ve essentially created the internet telethon.  People can follow along via blog posts, tweets, and a live video feed as they play the most boring and pointless video game ever created.  They keep playing (and being, as they say, “your monkey” for large donations with special requests) as long as the money comes in, up to the preset limit of 103 hours.  I like that it’s a reversal of the traditional TV telethon:  instead of viewers being tortured until they give in and donate, here, viewers get to torture the telethon players and decide the length of their torment.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your favorite charity event?  Do you have an idea for an unusual benefit?  Have you ever played Desert Bus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve read my latest free copy of ‘City News’ – have you? It’s a fab free publication by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, an international Pentacostal organisation of Brazilian origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about other people’s problems to alleviate desperation at your own may not be the most morally sound pastime, but it’s a human constant. My eye was caught by this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;This may sound bizarre and unbelievable, but since a long-term relationship break up I have been getting feelings of something having sex with me. I can fell myself being pushed down and this thing on top of me ...&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I certainly do believe you and trust me when I say that you are not the only one that is going through this problem. Surprisingly, it’s quite common but people are often embarrassed to seek help for it and often, if they do seek help, they do so in the wrong places. The good news is that we have helped thousands of people overcome this problem. As it is a spiritual problem and not a physical one, it must be fought using spiritual weapons. I would like to invite you to participate in our Friday services for spiritual cleansing. You will receive strong prayers against all negativity and to break any curse. A pastor will be able to give you advice on what else you will&lt;/em&gt; need to be totally free from these attacks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first saw an article of this type by the UCKG in ‘City News’ Nov/Dec 2000:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Some examples of Spiritual Attacks which include persistent dreams, sexual attacks, the feeling of being choked in dreams and the paralysing attack where one feels as if an overwhelming force comes over him and takes control of his whole body, except his mind. He can see what’s happening around him, but has no strength to react”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church again recommended attendance at its ‘Deliverance Services’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging through history, it isn’t hard to find other examples of this phenomenon. Here are a few more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I sleep – for a while – two or three hours – then a dream – no – a nightmare seizes me in its grip, I know full well that I am lying down and that I am asleep... I sense it and I know it... and I am also aware that somebody is coming up to me, looking at me, running his fingers over me, climbing on to my bed, kneeling on my chest, taking me by the throat and squeezing... squeezing... with all its might, trying to strangle me. I struggle, but I am tied down by that dreadful feeling of helplessness which paralyzes us in our dreams. I want to cry out – but I can’t. I want to move – I can’t do it. I try, making terrible, strenuous efforts, gasping for breath, to turn on my side, to throw off this creature who is crushing me and choking me – but I can’t! Then, suddenly, I wake up, panic-stricken, covered in sweat. I light a candle. I am alone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Guy de Maupassant&lt;br&gt;
'Le Horla' (1887)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“... a difficult respiration, a violent oppression on the breast, and a total privation of bodily motion ... In this agony they sigh, groan, utter indistinct sounds, and remain in the jaws of death, till, by the utmost efforts of nature, or some external assistance, they escape out of that dreadful, torpid state. As soon as they shake off that vast oppression, and are able to move the body, they are affected with strong Palpitation, great Anxiety, Langour, and Uneasiness”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
J Bond&lt;br&gt;
‘An Essay on the Incubus, or Nightmare’ (1753)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“persons suffering an attack suffer an incapability of motion, a torpid sensation in their sleep, a sense of suffocation and oppression, as if from one pressing them down, with inability to cry out, or they utter inarticulate sounds. Some imagine often that they even hear the person who is going to press them down, that he offers lustful violence to them but flies when they attempt to grasp him with their fingers”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Paulus Aegineta&lt;br&gt;
Physic in Roman Alexandria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“ … one passion is almost never absent – that of utter and incomprehensible dread … In every instance, there is a sense of oppression and helplessness … he [the victim – J] can hardly drag one limb after another … his blows are utterly ineffective”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R Macnish&lt;br&gt;
'The Philosophy of Sleep' (1834)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You are dreaming and you feel as if someone is holding you down. You can do nothing only cry out. People believe that you will die if you are not wakened” and “I remember waking up flat on my back. Paralyzed … Terrified beyond anything I’d ever experienced before … Sensation of pressure on my chest. The terror! The terror was both from being paralyzed and I knew there was something else in the room.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Quoted by David Hufford&lt;br&gt;
‘The Terror That Comes In The Night: An Experience-Centered Study of Supernatural Assaults’ (1982)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Jonathan Harker, seeing Dracula advance upon him says: “ … I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.unnaturalpredators.com/sp3.jpg" alt="Nightmare" align="left"&gt;And here’s a well-known pic by Henry Fuseli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I should declare my competing interests: I get attacked by demons too. Or ‘sleep paralysis’, as we call it in the real world. It’s not that unusual, and there’s really no evidence that it’s caused by demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Hufford (cited above), listed what he felt were the primary features of the experience, which were an impression of wakefulness coupled with immobility and a feeling of fear. In addition, he noted that a person’s actual setting was correctly perceived in contrast to a dream state where their surroundings could be distorted or false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common secondary features included the sleeping position – 90 percent of Hufford’s sample were supine. All writers on the subject, to my knowledge, have also noted this aspect. He even found some evidence that a disproportionate number of attacks are suffered by people in traction, or people who were doing systematic relaxation training such as yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common secondary features include a feeling of pressure on the chest and a sensation of threatening intent or evil nature from a supernatural being. Sounds are also often heard, such as the sound of door or ‘footsteps’ – ‘whooshing’ or ‘shuffling’ noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only slightly less frequent was the sensation that the victim would die: “The dread of suffocation, arising from the inability of inflating the lungs, is so great, that the person … generally imagines that he has very narrowly escaped death” Waller wrote in his “A Treatise on the Incubus, or Nightmare” of 1816. In some rare cases, victims reported an odour. There is also often a sexual element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to understand why people have historically regarded it as a supernatural affliction. “If you didn’t have the notion of ‘evil’, you’d have to invent after an encounter like that”, as one audience member put it at a lecture by Chris French on sleep paralysis at Goldsmiths on November 10th this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more mundane causes have been sought since the time of Galen, who thought the affliction due to gastric disturbance – hence the old advice about not eating cheese before bed-time. It appeared as an explanation of nightmare as recently as 1902 in The Chambers Encyclopedia. The theory underwent a minor change at the turn of the twentieth century, when it was wondered if it was the circulation rather than the digestion which was so critically afflicted by sleeping supine, which in turn caused nightmares. Kant had even formulated the idea that nightmare (the word used in its traditional sense) was a beneficial process which alerted a sufferer to the circulatory distress of his heart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.unnaturalpredators.com/sp2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
King James in his Daemonologie of 1597 ascribed them to a “naturall sicknesse … a thicke fleume [phlegm – J], falling upon our breast into the heart, while we are sleeping” while others thought it nothing more than too deep a sleep. Freudian psychoanalyst Ernest Jones attributed nightmares down to mental conflict over repressed sexual desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern age EEG technology has helped us to understand the different stages of sleep. Sleep paralysis, described broadly, is when your waking and sleeping functions mistime and collide: there is the normal paralysis of a sleeping body in the REM state (or you’d act your dreams out) but a conscious, rather than dreaming, mind; there is the depressed breathing rate of a sleeping body but panic at what may seem to be insufficient breath; there is the correct perception of your environment, but accompanied by dream phenomena such as dream hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep paralysis has been a major contributor to the folklore of fear. One day, when I’ve finished my book, you can read about Maras, Hags, Cauchemars, Civatateos and their kin (which probably includes aliens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, if you have any weird experiences and can’t afford the bus fare to your local UCKG, take comfort from the fact that the attacks are a well-known, well-described phenomenon, are usually sporadic and will probably just go away. The following precautions are sensible, and probably all you’ll ever need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Don’t sleep on your back – sew a cotton reel to the back of your pyjamas, nightdress or leather gimp suit. Folk tales and historical accounts overwhelmingly place the victim on their back when a position is mentioned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Try to sleep regular hours and not to get over-tired. Since sleep paralysis is associated with REM sleep colliding with wakefulness, it is more likely to occur when a person goes quickly into deep sleep - when they are exhausted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Don’t nap during the day while you’re going through a phase of SP. Although the majority of Hufford’s reported attacks took take place at night, the number during daytime naps was disproportionately large considering the fraction of total sleep hours they represented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Ask your sleeping partner to listen for laboured breathing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Try gently and calmly to move. Start by moving your eyeballs; they’re not paralysed during sleep. As soon as a person recovers their ability to move, the attack ends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Dr. Michael Persinger has worked on the possibility of a link between strong magnetic fields and certain types of brain activity. Try moving objects which produce strong magnetic fields, such as clock-radios, to a distance while you sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * When the hideous hag/demon/alien/Cadbury’s Smash Robot (go on, laugh at my pain!) advances on you, to your best to feel love and acceptance. Sounds weird. It works. They turn into bunnies, kittens … lovely things. The fear is self-begetting and counter-productive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... which is why is bothers me profoundly that people who offer an intervention, do so while encouraging a belief in demons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.unnaturalpredators.com/sp1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The UCKG’s publication is clear in several respects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“it is a spiritual problem and not a physical one, it must be fought using spiritual weapons”, and the most appropriate service is for “spiritual cleansing” which can “break any curse”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is a disclaimer in tiny print on the back page that the spiritual advice is “a compliment to scientifically proven treatment you may be receiving”, it neglects to mention that more mundane explanations and interventions for sleep paralysis exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org//view_media.php?id=29869"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/cassini_enceladus_2.jpg" alt="cassini_enceladus_2" title="cassini_enceladus_2" width="610" height="511"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That raw image (which means it has not been processed to remove instrument/detector artifacts like bad pixels and such) was taken when Cassini was a mere 2000 km (1200 miles) above the moon’s surface. The features are beautiful and plentiful… and it looks like a great place to ski. Bonus:  the low gravity would make the experience last longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassini &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/6001/Enceladus_Rev_121_Flyby_Raw_Preview_2"&gt;got an overview of the geysers&lt;/a&gt;, too, when it was still more than 500,000 km away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/6001/Enceladus_Rev_121_Flyby_Raw_Preview_2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/cassini_enceladus_nov202009.jpg" alt="cassini_enceladus_nov202009" title="cassini_enceladus_nov202009" width="608" height="493"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are raw images; that bright &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; just above Enceladus is probably a cosmic ray hit on the detector and not an actual astronomical object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002225/"&gt;at The Planetary Society blog&lt;/a&gt; Emily is, of course, having kittens over the pictures, and has made some stereoscopic pairs of them (though I’ll wait for the red/green anaglyphs; crossing my eyes at my monitor makes my tummy queasy). &lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/21/cassini-buzzes-enceladus-once-again/#comment-227272"&gt;in the comments below&lt;/a&gt;, BABloggee Alex links to anaglyphs he created. Very cool!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, because as these images are processed things will only get cooler. &lt;/p&gt;

Does your nose run?  You may be built upside-down.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; I giggled for a short time — just a couple of days, I think — at the surprising coincidence of the two verb senses, and the double pun, and then got on with whatever boys in short pants do during those parts of the day that are not taken up with giggling. But I see now that there is something linguistically interesting about the joke: the two questions convey the effect of a conditional.  So the content of the joke could be phrased (though for some reason much less amusingly) like this: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If your feet smell and your nose runs then you may be built upside-down.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; This similarity of effect between interrogative clauses and conditional clauses has a connection to the historical reason for an identity of form between the words introducing the interrogative subordinate clause in (1) and the conditional clause in (2). &lt;p&gt;    (1) &lt;i&gt;I don't know if the car will start.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;     (2) &lt;i&gt;We won't go if the car won't start.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The two &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;s share an etymology, but they have grown apart.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Traditional grammars do not recognize this.  They would say we have the same item in (1) and (2): a "subordinating conjunction".  But the analysis that Huddleston and I set out in &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dispenses entirely with the term "subordinating conjunction", on the grounds that it is a label for a rag-bag of items that should have been analyzed in two different ways. A small number of the items in question are &lt;b&gt;subordinators&lt;/b&gt;: meaningless markers such as &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; that appear at the beginnings of subordinate clauses.  The rest are &lt;b&gt;prepositions&lt;/b&gt; that happen to take clauses rather than noun phrases as their complements: words like &lt;i&gt;though&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt;.  These have substantial semantic content, taking clauses and converting them into adjuncts expressing concession, cause, reason, etc. &lt;p&gt; The word &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; is unusual in that it is actually two different items, one a subordinator and the other a preposition.  The &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; in (1) is a subordinator, with no more meaning than &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; has; but the &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; in (2) is a preposition which forms an adjunct phrase expressing a precondition for the the truth of the matrix clause. In the contemporary language there are many syntactic differences between them.  I recently set it as an exercise for my students to demonstrate these differences.  Let me share with you the ten syntactic arguments with which I supported the view that the two items are grammatically distinct.  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; can be replaced by &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; (which is slightly more formal), but the Preposition can't: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I don't know if it's true.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I don't know whether it's true.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Have some cake if you want.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;Have some cake whether you want.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; can be replaced by other prepositions such as &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt;, but the Subordinator can't: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I'll jump in if you do.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I'll jump in after you do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I don't know if I'll jump in.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;I don't know after I'll jump in.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; An &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;-PP is an &lt;b&gt;adjunct&lt;/b&gt;, and adjunct PPs can be preposed very readily.  Content clauses, on the other hand, are by no means so readily preposed. Sometimes an interrogative content clause can be preposed: we can get &lt;i&gt;Whether this is true I cannot not say&lt;/i&gt;; but clauses beginning with interrogative &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; seem not to prepose (?&lt;i&gt;If this is true I cannot not say&lt;/i&gt; doesn't seem to mean &lt;i&gt;I cannot say whether this is true&lt;/i&gt;), and certainly the complement of &lt;i&gt;wonder&lt;/i&gt; does not seem to prepose at all; so there are fairly clear contrasts like this: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;If I learned how to walk on water, they would probably still ignore me.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;If I could learn to walk on water, I wonder.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;If you want you can have some cake.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;If there is any cake left I don't know.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can add &lt;i&gt;or not&lt;/i&gt; to a closed interrogative content clause, but not to a conditional phrase, so only the second of these is grammatical: &lt;p&gt; *&lt;i&gt;If I learned how to walk on water or not, they would probably still ignore me.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I wonder if I could learn to walk on water or not.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The irrealis form of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (namely, 1st and 3rd singular &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt;) occurs (at least in formal styles) in the complement of conditional &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;, but not in interrogative content clauses: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I would eat worms if I &lt;u&gt;were&lt;/u&gt; a bird.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; Bad: *&lt;i&gt;I wonder if I &lt;u&gt;were&lt;/u&gt; a bird in some previous life.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;He wouldn't treat you like that if he &lt;u&gt;were&lt;/u&gt; in love with you.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;I never knew if he &lt;u&gt;were&lt;/u&gt; going to come home at night.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Preposition, but not the Subordinator, can be modified by placing the focusing modifier adverb &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; before it: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;They would probably still ignore me even if I learned how to walk on water.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;They would probably still ignore me if I learned how to walk on water.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;We need to know if he is on our side or not.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;We need to know even if he is on our side or not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The focusing modifier adverb &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; can also occur before Preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; as a modifier but not before the Subordinator. It may be possible to interpret &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; as modifying the main clause in the latter case (&lt;i&gt;I wonder only if we can trust him&lt;/i&gt; can be read as saying "The only thing I wonder about is whether we can trust him); but we can form a coordination of conditional &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; with another &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; that is premodified with &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;, to get a familiar expression of the logical biconditional, and this clearly fails with the Subordinator, giving a reliable test: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I will do it if and only if we can get agreement from the committee.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;I wonder if and only if we can get agreement from the committee.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The focusing modifier &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; also occurs in an idiomatic combination after the Preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;, and this too is specific to the Preposition: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I could get some sleep if only the baby would stop crying.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;I wonder if only the baby could somehow be stopped from crying.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conditional &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; takes reduced clause complements as well as full clause complements, but this is not true of the Subordinator: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I will open the emergency door if instructed to do so.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;I wonder if instructed to do so.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is an idiom &lt;i&gt;if that&lt;/i&gt; meaning something like "even if that much is true".  It is limited to the Preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; and cannot occur with the Subordinator: &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;There were about six people in the audience, if that.&lt;/i&gt;    [preposition &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt; *&lt;i&gt;Someone told me there were six people in the audience, but I wonder if that.&lt;/i&gt;    [subordinator &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt; These ten largely independent arguments provide overwhelming evidence for the difference between the two &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;s.  Those syntactic differences are there despite the fact that the two versions of the joke with which I began (the funny original version and the oddly unfunny conditional version) have very much the same semantic effect. A conditional has an effect very similar to that of posing a question that is crucial to the evaluation of the matrix clause: &lt;i&gt;If the cap fits, wear it&lt;/i&gt; has an effect very similar to the sequence &lt;i&gt;Does the cap fit?  Then wear it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;p&gt; There are absolutely no dictionaries anywhere that treat &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; as a preposition.  They all disagree with what I have just said.  But I'm not here to give you just the truths that dictionary makers have so far felt they can stomach.  I'm here to give you the whole truth.  &lt;b&gt;All printed dictionaries of English are wrong.&lt;/b&gt;  Sorry, but that's the way it is. Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the introductions to the sessions on the Program, here is what will happen on Saturday, January 16th at 11:30am - 12:35pm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Legal Aspects of publishing, sharing and blogging science - &lt;a href="http://blog.stodden.net/" title=""&gt;Victoria Stodden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Not giving legal advice, but discussion of CC-licences, copyright, Fair Use, libel laws, etc. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Legal_Aspects/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;B.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Shakespeare wasn't a semantic web guy - &lt;a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/rees/" title=""&gt;Jonathan Rees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: That which we call a rose, by any other name, wouldn't be identified by a computer as a rose. This talk will go through the Shared Name initiative which promotes community-wide use of shared names for records from public databases. The goal is to have a significant effect on the practice of bioinformatics by making it easier to share and link data sets and tools across projects. Selecting and maintaining names is a serious capacity building problem for moving the RDF world from the hacker and hobbyist community to the regular user. And a growing body of experience emphasizes that for any solution to be generally adopted, it must not only be technically sound, but also serve and empower the community of users. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Shakespeare/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Citizen Science - &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecheerleader.com/" title=""&gt;Darlene Cavalier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncseagrant.org/component/content/article/59?template=clear&amp;amp;class=about="&gt;Scott Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chillnc" title=""&gt;Ben MacNeill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:  Not so long ago, "citizen scientist" would have seemed to be a contradiction in terms. Science is traditionally something done by people in lab coats who hold PhDs. As with classical music or acting, amateurs might be able to appreciate science, but they could not contribute to it. Today, however, enabled by technology and empowered by social change, science-interested laypeople are transforming the way science gets done. Through a myriad of different projects, citizen scientists are collaborating with professionals, conducting field studies, and adding valuable local detail to research. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Citizen_Science/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Talking Trash: Online Outreach from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Miriam Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lindseyhoshaw.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Lindsey Hoshaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.diveintoyourimagination.com/about/about-annie/about-annie-164.html" title=""&gt;Annie Crawley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theplasticocean.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Bonnie Monteleone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: Debris in the North Pacific Gyre received unprecedented attention in 2009 with voyages from the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, Project Kaisei, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Each voyage integrated online outreach into its mission, but emphasized very different aspects of the problem. What are the challenges of creating a major outreach effort from one of the most isolated places on earth? How can scientists, journalists, and educators balance "exciting findings live from the field!" with "highly preliminary unpublished non-peer-reviewed data that our labwork might contradict"? And why is the public so interested in the issue of trash in the ocean, anyway? Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Talking_Trash/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Scientific visualization - &lt;a href="http://whatitslikeontheinside.com/" title=""&gt;Tara Richerson (science_goddess)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I thought therefore that I would point out that Chile has an extraordinary set of very large rock avalanches. Earlier this year, Antinao and Gosse (2009) published an interesting review of a set in the Chilean Cordillera Principal.  I do not intend to publish a full review of the paper here, but thought I would highlight just one of the slides, called Yeso - Meson Alto.  This is a very large landslide, as the Google Earth image below shows:I have eyeballed in the main landslide deposit (note that in places this is covered with more recent fluvial (river) deposits, so this is very approximate.  I have used the supplementary information from Antinao and Gosse (2009) as a guide as this contains a map of the landslide, and another large slide downstream (which I have included below my indicative lines on the Google Earth image:The statistics for this landslide provided by Antinao and Gosse (2009) are impressive:Volume: 4.5 cubic kilometresOriginal surface area: 22.7 square kilometresLength (travel distance): 7.6 kmThe landslide is considered to have been translational as the deposit retains the original stratigraphy.  Interestingly, it is thought to have occurred in the Holocene (i.e. in the last 12,000 years).ReferenceAntinao, J., &amp;amp; Gosse, J. (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if Jerry’s European trip will allow him to post a Caturday Felid today, so here’s something I’ve just posted over at &lt;a href="http://z-letter.com"&gt;the Z-letter&lt;/a&gt; [apologies for double posting]. Not really about cats, and yet, a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European pine marten (&lt;em&gt;Martes martes&lt;/em&gt;) is a mustelid – part of the weasel family – and about the size of a cat. There is also a North American relative (&lt;em&gt;Martes americana&lt;/em&gt;). They mainly nocturnal and pretty hard to spot. Here’s a rather nice picture of a pine marten, from &lt;a href="http://www.djsphotography.co.uk/"&gt;DJS photography&lt;/a&gt; (note its right ear, presumably nibbled in a fight):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://zletter.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/pine-marten-12.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Pine-Marten-12" src="http://zletter.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/pine-marten-12.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=333&amp;amp;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last episode of Autumnwatch on the BBC last night, Chris Packham claimed that pine martens are very partial to a jam sandwich, and this does indeed seem to be the case (Mr Google has 272 hits with those two phrases – 273 now this page has been posted [= 274 with this copy of the page...]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although primarily carnivorous, they will also eat berries, honey and other sweet stuff. Hence the jam sandwiches. Cats, on the other hand, do not eat jam sandwiches or honey. And cats cannot taste sugar, for the simple reason that their genome does not possess the relevant T1R2 receptor which, together with the T1R3 receptor (which they do have), enables mammals to detect sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I predict that when the pine marten genome is eventually sequenced, we will find, nestled in its chromosomes, the T1R2 receptor…&lt;/p&gt;

Holman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smith&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 1928. The place was Arkansas. Charles Lee Smith, President of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism was arrested “on charges of blasphemy.” His crime? Passing out atheist tracts in a local town. After spending one night in jail, Smith was released with one charge dismissed while the other was never set for trial. Just like the famous blasphemy trial of C.B. Reynolds decades earlier, Mr. Smith was just one more victim of the American legal system, hijacked by Christianity.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inoculation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 1722. The date, July 8th. The place, St. Andrew’s Church in London, England. A bold, determined preacher walked up to his pulpit and delivered a heartfelt sermon entitled, “Against the Dangerous and Sinful Practice of Inoculation.” The sermon was published and became widely famous. His text, Job 2:7, “So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.” His contention, that Job was suffering from Smallpox (the epidemic of the time) and yet he endured it, and therefore, so should Christians the onslaught of Smallpox in his day. The masses took this advice. Smallpox killed and maimed and ravaged hundreds of thousands of people. It spread and spread some more. The new and experimental scientific practice of inoculation was an abomination, which the preachers proclaimed, “usurped God’s providential authority.” This preacher was none other than the Rev. Edmund Massey, who pleaded from the bottom of his heart, along with scores of Catholic and Protestant church leaders everywhere, not to tolerate the “diabolical operation.” God wanted man to suffer for his sins and to endure his punishment, so said University of Cambridge’s, Reverend Ramsden no less vigorously. He and other Bostonians formed the Anti-Vaccination Society in 1798. The result, an incredible death toll among both Catholics and Protestants, particularly the Catholics, some of whom almost came to bloodshed out of the pious desire to trust in God and not let some physicians make the procedure mandatory…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:” (James 5:14)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.” (2 Chron. 16:12)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there you have it – God does not recommend amoxicillin! It is not hard to see what God wants us to do when we’re sick. Very few dissenting voices expressed themselves, until later when yet a greater number of lives were lost because of this foolish zeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruno&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;February 17, 1600. Giordano Bruno, an Italian philosopher, astronomer, ex-priest, and freethinker, was burned at the stake for the crime of heresy. His Copernicanism, Arianism, his contentions that all churches should tolerate their schismatic disagreements, along with his somewhat materialistic beliefs that the universe was infinite and contained many worlds, could not be tolerated. He really crossed the line when he decided Jesus was nothing more than a skillful magician! Talking like that back then would get you killed. Bruno’s defiance and distinct individuality made him seas of enemies. On May 22, 1592, he was arrested, and by January of 1593, his trial, which lasted almost 7 years, began. He was tortured and delivered up to be killed, repudiating images of the cross along the way. Lest any be seduced by his heretical words, a large spike was driven through his jaw, just after proclaiming his last words. He then painfully awaited his silent consummation by fire. Giordano was a man bigger than the time in which he lived. The world was not worthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Servetus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 1553. On October 27th, Michael Servetus was burned at the stake for the crime of heresy. He committed serious “crimes,” disbelieving in the trinity, dabbling in astrology, and denying the need and validity of the practice of infant baptism. His irate, argumentative tone, much like Bruno, made him plenty of enemies among both Protestants and Catholics. Having been burned in effigy after escaping from Roman authorities in Vienna, he fled to Geneva where he was spotted by reformer, John Calvin, who had vowed to God that the heretic, Servetus, would not leave the city alive! True to Calvin’s vow, it was not the Catholics who killed him, but the Geneva Council, who decided he should meet his maker by way of the flames. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The impenitent, stubborn Servetus soon lost his pride as the slow-burning flames engulfed his body. Blood curdling screams for mercy were rumored to be heard throughout the crowd of onlookers, and thus, ended the legacy of a brilliant mathematician and quite able physician.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corrupt and scandalous&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not take Solomonic wisdom to detect my running theme -- that Christianity is an albatross to humankind, this small list being scarcely a microscopic fraction of what could be cited to prove the point. It should be noted that these are modern and not-so-modern examples of Christian oppression. They emanate from Catholic and Protestant groups, and therefore, cannot be so easily wept under the rug of willful ignorance by suggesting that the above examples were merely the result of “false Christianity.” For centuries, believers have been disagreeing with each other, telling each other that they are wrong on this and that, and therein lies the problem when a believer tries to deny that Group X is a “True Christian” group, but not Group Y. The dispute on what constitutes “genuine” Christianity is as unsolvable a puzzle as partisan politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity is not a religion of progress, nor is it a religion of open-mindedness. It does not tolerate, nor appreciate free inquiry. It condemns it outright (I Timothy 6:20-21). It sets up the classic clergy-laity system by setting up few as teachers (See James 3:1) and the rest as dumbbells, members who sit like wooden Indians and take in what their spiritual leaders tell them. Like the ancient mystery cults, which were so common in New Testament times and before, Christianity claims infallibility and thereby vilifies everyone and every school of thought to disagree with it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.” (I Cor. 16:22)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.” (2 John 1:10-11)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the aide of an evolving, progressive culture, Christianity would still have us in the dark ages, prattling off the pious nonsense of Tertullian…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age: the guilt must of necessity live too. You are the devil's gateway: you are the unsealer of that (forbidden) tree: you are the first deserter of the divine law: you are she who persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account of your desert-that is, death-even the Son of God had to die.”&lt;br&gt;- Tertullian, “On Women and Fallen Angels,” Book I&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the aide of an evolving, progressive culture, Christianity would still have us forbidding surgery lest we defile a dead body and dishonor God. Mankind would have no doubt progressed medically beyond where we are today had we had access to biological experimentation 700 years ago. But in exchange for life-saving medical advances, we are given the sanctified decisions of church councils. In 1299 A.D., Pope Boniface VIII issued a papal bull that decreed the penalties for anyone with the ungodly gall to dissect a corpse -- excommunication and possible imprisonment. The hurt that this has done to the fields of anatomy and biology is quite incalculable, but I’m sure Boniface felt more than justified in this move and even felt he could support it with the Bible…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:” (Amos 2:1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity produces intolerance and suspicion and a dreaded, undying fear of change. As we have seen, it opposes science, it opposes medicine, it opposes logic, and even common sense. It makes man’s way difficult, burdened down with needless concerns and worries. It lays at the feet of society an alarmist mentality of spotting trouble where there is none and always being ready to reject sensible solutions to problems. These handful of examples, if nothing else, show us that when mankind is morally motivated and indoctrinated by a religion that claims to be “infallible truth,” the tendency to bind those “truths” on others always ends up being hurtful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it interesting how Christians will so readily site Newton and Galileo as examples of Christians demonstrating scientific refinement, and then silently gloss over the long, cold, dark years of bibles being chained to pulpits, women being forced into convents, the mentally ill being locked up and tortured for fear of their being possessed, and forbidding marriages in local towns because of expressed defiance from the common people. The Church expressed her complete contentment with the “Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water” theory of elements as taught by the ancient Greeks, until the likes of Priestly and Scheele came along and set us straight on the matter with the groundbreaking discovery of oxygen. Christians are every bit as capable of anything everyone else is, but my question is, if Christianity promotes science and free inquiry, why did it take Christianity many centuries to produce only a handful of great thinkers? The answer is, it didn’t. Christianity has never directly produced a single freethinker. Mankind was finally breaking away from the stranglehold that the infamously oppressive Catholic Church had on the world, and with that came flourishing minds who could begin to experiment and question and think on their own without fear of the guillotine (or as much fear of it, at least). As the Church began to lose grip of the world, slowly but surely, objective learning could once again be exercised. Christianity remained, by far, the most dominant religion throughout Europe, so it would be a shock if at least some scientists and thinkers were not of the Christian Faith. But those good scientific minds were scientists and Christians – they were not scientists because they were Christians. We cannot give credit where credit is not due.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity, unleashed on the world, has done many terrible things throughout the ages, far outweighing any good it managed to accomplish. Only when faith in the church’s infallible dogmas began to decline did we see increases in liberty. Today, the church contains only a glimmer of her former, snarling, mad dog image. To make better inroads infiltrating societies, she now uses the stealth approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, however, is the freethinker’s perspective. It is not the believer’s perspective. The proud, white, middle-class, Protestant of today is utterly perplexed at how the freethought movement could dare suggest that Christianity is a vice against humanity. They live in their own Christianized world and attribute every little semblance of pleasantness and decency to their God. Christianity takes credit for everything even remotely good and runs away, like a caught-cheating husband, from any hint of bad publicity. As Woolsey Teller so eloquently put it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But leave it to Christianity to bedeck itself in stolen plumage. After blocking the cultural progress of the world for hundreds of years, it now poses as the champion of civilization, when, in plain truth, its behavior has been like that of the chameleon, changing colors and blending with the background whenever it is expedient. Let a people gather a few crumbs of culture in spite of Christianity and Christianity will claim the credit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christianity upheld slavery for over a thousand years, yet no sooner was emancipation achieved than it posed as "the black man's friend". It spat on woman suffrage, then, when woman's rights were won, it posed as the "liberator" of women. It fought tooth and nail the doctrine of evolution, but now assures us (from "liberal" pulpits, at least) that there never was any "real" conflict between science and religion. It opposed anesthesia in child-birth; it now proclaims it as God's "gift" to womankind. Before the war, it worshiped "the Prince of Peace"; it is now singing the song, "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.”&lt;br&gt;- Woolsey Teller, Essays of an Atheist, “Chameleonic Christianity.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why Christianity stands condemned in the council of freethinking humanity as a mischievous trespasser, a migrant troublemaker, stirring up ruckus and unrest everywhere she goes. With useless regulations and hindrances, it does nothing but crush the life out of an observant, budding, and experimental society. Like a cruel, dry, second grade teacher who berates her students for innocently choosing to color and doodle outside of the lines, Christianity is a detriment to the progress of any society. Christianity operates by manipulation, befriending the mighty, seizing their power, and when finished using them, casting them out like spoiled goods. Just like a crooked, but sharply-dressed, well-poised politician, Christianity vainly points to a bright, appealing future, replete with promises of a Utopian tomorrow, while cleverly maneuvering their believers to keep from noticing the plentitude of horrendous injustices, allegations, and scandals of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted 3/6/06&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-114170267107032042?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But honestly, I don’t have a whole lot to say about &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/146-Central-Peak-of-Rutherfurd.html#extended"&gt;this particular image&lt;/a&gt;, from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, showing boulders that have rolled downhill to the bottom of the 45 kilometer-wide Rutherford crater:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Click to embiggen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I still have not gotten used to these super hi-res pictures. This one is 510 meters across. See the big rock at the top, left of center? The one casting a long shadow? That’s about the size of my &lt;em&gt;yard&lt;/em&gt;, and I don’t have a particularly large piece of property. Some of the rocks in this image are smaller than a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Wow. The good news is, these images still do amaze me. I’m pretty happy I haven’t been spoiled yet. But as more pictures come back from LRO, that might happen. I’m only human — but I do have a large capacity for amazement. Keep ‘em coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total amount given for the Nature Blogs Group was $5,170.  That put our group at #11–not quite in the top 10, but still pretty darn good!  That also is quite a bit more than I managed by myself last year ($270).  YAY! And &lt;strong&gt;THANK YOU!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;a href="http://blog.donorschoose.org/blog/2009/11/03/the-social-media-challenge-wraps-up-637000-raised-for-116000-students-by-over-4500-donors/"&gt;total amount given this year was $637,336&lt;/a&gt;. That’s amazing! I was very excited to see that one of the top groups was &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=25154&amp;amp;category=109"&gt;Making a difference for Michigan Children&lt;/a&gt;.  Teachers are being laid off left and right here, so making sure our remaining teachers are supported and have the tools they need is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 of the 12 projects I chose were fully funded–that’s a lot of new buggy and gardening stuff in the hands of kids. Still need an end of year tax deduction? You can still give!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/_uploads/imgpool/3mx12m_w1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.humanism.org.uk/_uploads/imgpool/3mx12m_w1000.jpg" title="NewAd" width="550" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the campaign is to point out how absurd it is to thrust a label — any label — onto a child who doesn’t even understand what that label means.  It would be foolish to call any kid a “Republican child” or a “Catholic child” or an “Agnostic child.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That idea hits home any more when you read &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6925781.ece"&gt;this ridiculous column&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Ruth Gledhill&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Times Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quotes &lt;strong&gt;Brad Mason&lt;/strong&gt;, a Christian pastor, whose kids happen to be the ones featured in the ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said: “It is quite funny, because obviously they were searching for images of children that looked happy and free. &lt;strong&gt;They happened to choose children who are Christian. It is ironic. The humanists obviously did not know the background of these children.&lt;/strong&gt;”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*facepalm*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait.  There’s more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Gerald Coates, the leader of the Pioneer network of churches, which Mr Mason and his family used to attend before they moved to Dorset, said: “&lt;strong&gt;I think it is hilarious that the happy and liberated children on the atheist poster are in fact Christian&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, they couldn’t get past the kids’ images to read the words written on the ads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are not Christian children&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the children of Christian parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get.  It.  Right.  And stop labeling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, what’s with the headline for this article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children who front Richard Dawkins’ atheist ads are evangelicals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not Dawkins’ ads.  He may support them, but this is not his campaign.  And they’re certainly not pro-atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tan’s work overflows with human warmth and childlike wonder. But it also makes a perfect adult bedtime story, a little something to shake loose your imagination from the moors of reality right before your own dreams kick in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a look through my &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/04/skeptical-books-for-children-part-four/"&gt;Skeptical Books for Children&lt;/a&gt; series, you may notice that I’ve referred to teaching the works of Shaun Tan before. I’ve forgotten how long I’ve collected his work, but I first remember meeting him around the time that ‘The Rabbits’ was released. I now have several of his prints hanging in my house and a few originals that I’ve sent to friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was born the same year as me, lived in suburbs nearby and his high school was in a suburb near mine too. His lectures are fantastic, his books unite quirkiness, sensitivity and surrealism – his artistry is sublime. His more recent book, ‘Tales from Suburbia’ was reviewed earlier on my site (’&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/06/stop-what-youre-doing-new-shaun-tan-book/"&gt;Stop What You’re Doing! New Shaun Tan Book!&lt;/a&gt;‘). I was particularly struck by ‘&lt;em&gt;Eric&lt;/em&gt;‘, the tiny tale of a “foreign exchange student” (it is so like ‘The Arrival’ in many ways) and ‘&lt;em&gt;Grandpa’s Story&lt;/em&gt;‘, an interpretation of the journey of a relationship, primarily told in awe-inspiring visuals of immense challenges meeting the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Shaun Tan visits Fremantle, he does lectures and seminars for teachers, children and artists at one of my favourite venues, the &lt;a title="Fremantle Children&amp;amp;#39;s Literature Centre" href="http://www.fclc.com.au/"&gt;Fremantle Children’s Literature Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a short film I made about one of the sessions on ‘The Arrival’ that I attended. Most of what you can see are original sketches, drafts and plans for the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Festival for 2010 features a &lt;a href="http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/2010/Theatre/The-Arrival/"&gt;stage-play of The Arrival&lt;/a&gt; and I hope that it tours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, usually the deal here on &lt;em&gt;Aard&lt;/em&gt; is that I tell you what to think and you reply, zombielike, "Yes... Master... Kill... Kill...". But today, let's turn the tables. I'm going to ask a question about a simple scientific-culinary matter that has baffled me for decades. And I hope someone out there knows enough about yeast to enlighten me.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When starved of oxygen, yeast turns sugar into alcohol.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When germinated, barley grains, by means of the enzyme amylase, turn some of their constituent starch into sugar. This process is called malting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to make beer, you must malt the barley. This suggests that yeast cannot make alcohol out of starch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Swedish vodka is made from potatoes, which are very high in starch but cannot be malted. This suggests that yeast &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; make alcohol out of starch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here's my question: if yeast can make alcohol directly out of starch, why bother malting the barley before making beer? Couldn't you just mix barley flour with water and yeast and put a lid on the slop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update same evening:&lt;/b&gt; Dale P and other Dear Readers solved the conundrum för me. Yeast cannot in fact ferment starch. To ferment potato mash, you add enzyme-containing barley malt to it!&lt;/p&gt;

After all, procreation (self-replication) is the central theme in biology, and we tend to find it more fun when more than one individual is involved. Especially when these individuals differ anatomically into categories, in our case, two types, since that is what&amp;#39;s most familiar to us. As far as I know, no lineage has evolved obligatory triple conjugations of three different mating types, although such a thing can be induced in the lab. But for now, let&amp;#39;s have a look at a particularly unusual developmental glitch in an individual barnacle, and an even more surreal publication accompanying it:An Individual Barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, with Two Penises    (Hoch &amp;amp; Yuen2009 J Crustacean Biol) [NOT SAFE FOR WORK due to images of genitalia. Unless you work in biology...]     I came across this while responding to someone&amp;#39;s comment, and chuckled. Then I checked whether it really was a single individual case, and whether it really was published in a real journal. In 2009. Yes and yes. It was a rather entertaining read as well. Now, I would go off on a rant about some of their hypotheses and assumptions, but the type of work and the following accompanying note in the acknowledgements suggest this was actually an undergrad project, and I should be nice to my brethren:&amp;quot;This work was partially supported by a Student Research Fellowship from the American Microscopical Society to [author] and a Crustacean Society Summer Research Fellowship to [author].&amp;quot;&amp;quot;So,  what did you do this summer?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Found a barnacle with two penises, and you?&amp;quot;Damn, I wish my summers were as exciting. They usually get spent in a dark room staring at blue [DAPI] dots all day. Sometimes I surgically rape a tiny flower with a pair forceps. Other times I drown my poor seedlings in nasty cytotoxins, and wonder why how they die. This guy got to measure barnacle genitalia. And infer about its sex life.Here are the two penises in all their glory:Lemme paraphrase all the scientific lingo: &amp;quot;OMG, TWO penises!&amp;quot; (Hoch &amp;amp; Yuen 2009 J Crustacean Biol)So why barnacles, of all things? Thing is, upon reaching maturity, they glue themselves to the rock. And become stuck there. And then they get horny, but they can&amp;#39;t go out. Kind of like that basement-dwelling 4chan crawling internet loser nerd stereotype. With one key difference: in the barnacle case, size does matter. A lot. Maybe that&amp;#39;s not such a key difference, and we won&amp;#39;t go there in this polite company (LOL!), but the barnacles can do it without ever going out. All they need is really loooooong penises, long enough to reach the next mother&amp;#39;s basement-dwelling geek barnacle. And those beyond it. You can see how this particular sticky situation can lead to evolutionary peddling of male organ enlargment solutions*.*My horrible, horrible mind is trying to imagine what molecular spam would look like... alas, my imagination does not stretch as far as barnacle penises If only they were immersed in some serious horizontal gene transfer...They&amp;#39;ve proposed that at least one of the penises is fully functional, as the sole nearby barnacle has been fertilised. Then they wonder whether this was a genetic or developmental accident. Well, when your sample size is...ONE...it becomes very difficult to separate the two. Especially when you terminate the sole specimen by chopping its penises off. A regularly inherited twin penis trait would be rather unlikely; it&amp;#39;s quite improbable for a genetic change to result in the doubling of an entire organ in the metazoan version of multicellularity. So it&amp;#39;s likely just a chance developmental glitch. I&amp;#39;ve seen a photo of a tulip with half its leaf converted to a petal, but only one tulip and a single leaf -- another example of an entertaining, but biologically unimportant, developmental glitch.So, to summarise:Lab slave: Holy shit guys, this one has two penises!PI: OMG, let&amp;#39;s see if we can publish that!Slave: LOL nice joke, buddy!PI: No, seriously![...]Reviewer: So what&amp;#39;s the scientific significance of this work?Authors: It has two penises, lol XD!Reviewer: *giggle* Ah what the hell, we need our [juvenile] entertainment too! *accept*So what is their actual stated conclusion?&amp;quot;The result is significant because it shows that the mating ability of the barnacle is resilient to developmental instability and able to overcome extreme departure from normal morphology.&amp;quot;For a sample size of ONE. Remember guys, this isn&amp;#39;t a mutant line or anything, this is ONE single freak case. But they had to write something ^_~  Still amused by this getting published though...And now for another anomaly:Ciliate orgiesCiliates are obligate sexual organisms. If they don&amp;#39;t have sex within a certain number of generations (~50 for Paramecium), their somatic nucleus basically rots away. Thing is, they actually have two different nuclei - one the pass on, and one they use (ie transcriptionally active). The transcriptionally active &amp;#39;macronucleus&amp;#39; (MAC) is essentially a giant bag of linear plasmids, sometimes having upwards of ~9000 copies of a single unigenomic, or just really short, chromosome. A problem with having so many chromosomes is evident at mitosis -- how do you attach a bundle of microtubules to every single chromosome of the thousands there are? Well, you just...don&amp;#39;t.Ciliate MACs undergo a special form of nuclear division termed &amp;#39;amitosis&amp;#39;, where the nucleus is more or less pinched in half (ciliates do closed mitosis where the nuclear membrane remains intact the whole time), more or less evenly. Sort of. This is roughly compensated for by some rather crazy DNA replication regulation stuff, but eventually the organism may start losing genes. (how it corrects for the ever-changing gene copy numbers is beyond me...*)This is were sex comes in -- the ciliate exchanges its germline &amp;#39;pronuclei&amp;#39; (haploid gametes, if you will) with that/those of its partner (in some species, it gets complicated...), and makes a new MAC. Actually, the making of a new MAC heavily depends on the preceding one, which gets destroyed just as the new one is formed, yet its information can still influence it...basically, a paradise for anyone obsessing over epigenetics! In fact, I&amp;#39;ve done an essay on that stuff for a class: Ciliate genome rearrangements pdf  (not my best writing as I spent way too much time reading stuff and not enough time constructing sensible sentences...)*Hmmm, just thought of this: overexpression lines might be a problem in a ciliate model, no? It may well be that just like what seems to be happening with the polycistronic gene situation in trypanosomes, may be also happening here: namely -- highly emphasised post-transcriptional  and post-translational regulation of gene expression levels rather than direct regulation of the promoter... thus would mean that driving a gene with a highly expressed promoter might be compensated for by some pathways specific to regulating that gene (or its class), thereby screwing with your overexpression attempts. Any thoughts?So, before I get too carried away with this, ciliates need sex. Furthermore, I&amp;#39;ll argue that sex was a prerequisite for such a ridiculous genomic system to evolve in the first place -- frequent sex...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even among young people, texting became popular in the U.S. only a couple of years ago, more than five years after it became widespread in Europe and Japan. See "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005441.html"&gt;What's the difference?&lt;/a&gt;" (3/10/2008), and some of the links there, e.g. "&lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1683713"&gt;No text please, we're American&lt;/a&gt;", The Economist, 4/3/2003; "&lt;a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2003/04/000355.htm"&gt;Why text messaging is not popular in the US&lt;/a&gt;", textually.org, 4/4/2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that I asked then seems still to be unanswered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The explanations offered for the geographic difference, back then, included Japanese commuting habits and social conventions discouraging phone conversations in public; greater availability of networked computers to Americans; different voice, SMS and internet pricing structures between Europe and the U.S.; the fact that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; "was originally defined as part of the GSM series of standards", while U.S. cell phone service is more diverse in terms of its underlying technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But in general, these things haven't changed (as far as I know). So why are U.S. adolescents suddenly texting up a storm? Is this a cultural change driven by purely cultural factors?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are the social scientists when you need them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, today's Non Sequitur has a theory to offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NS_PunAddiction.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NS_PunAddiction.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd have to add some extraneous hypotheses about overseas testing, but of course a good conspiracy theory thrives on extraneous hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

The film documented a series of debates on the topic “Is Christianity Good for the World?” between &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/strong&gt; and evangelical theologian &lt;strong&gt;Doug Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was billed as a discussion (as opposed to a debate) and I thought it delivered that.  I said what I wanted to say, and I think &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Chad Meister&lt;/strong&gt; (the Christian on the panel; he’s on the right in the picture below) would say the same.  Pastor &lt;strong&gt;Mark Bergin&lt;/strong&gt; was the moderator (below, left) and he asked some very good questions to lead the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_4783_collision.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cafewitteveen.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_4783_collision.jpg" title="Collision" width="550" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m told video of the event will be coming soon and I’ll post it if I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Witteveen&lt;/strong&gt; was in the audience and he has a lot to say about the event.  He’ll talk more about the panel next week, but for now, he &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/11/20/collision-more-like-a-tree-falling-in-the-forest/"&gt;shares his thoughts on the movie itself&lt;/a&gt; (he wasn’t a fan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because of &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/11/20/collision-followed-by-panel-with-mehta-and-meister/"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; Jeremy alluded to on his website and which he’ll talk more about soon — I felt the same way about it so I’m glad I wasn’t alone.  (&lt;a href="http://codemenkey.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/collision-screening/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codemenkey&lt;/strong&gt; agrees, too&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Question &amp;amp; Answer time was almost entirely dominated by atheists.  (Which is fine.  I’m glad they went up to the microphone to ask their questions.  I wish more Christians would’ve done that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: Many of those atheists used the time not to ask a question, but to tell everyone about their views of religion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, they felt the need to comment on things Wilson argued in the movie.  There was no question posed to me or Chad — it was just long, rambling, word vomit.  Or they told stories about their encounters with religious people who made really bad arguments in favor of God’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it happened once, I could just chalk it up to a self-righteous person who just enjoys the sound of his own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it happened several times.  And it was annoying as hell: to the (mostly Christian) audience, to me, to Jeremy, and (I’m sure) many of the other atheists who came to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time I’ve seen it happen.  I’ve been to plenty of atheist conventions where people have done the same thing.  (Which makes no sense… who are you trying to convince with your views?!)  It’s particularly frustrating because at many of these events, you come because of the speaker (&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;, for example).  You want to hear his views in the limited time you have, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the views of random people from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish our moderator in this case would have cut them off and just asked, “What’s your question?” but he was in a rough position as a Christian pastor — he may have been thinking of the backlash he would receive if he kept cutting off atheists who wanted to speak their minds.  I don’t blame him for letting them go on… and on… and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this sort of thing goes on at non-religious events as well, but it needs to stop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution I’ve found is to &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/10/17/what-they-didnt-ask-at-the-megachurch/"&gt;collect questions from the audience&lt;/a&gt; before the panel discussion starts.  The audience writes down what they want to ask, a volunteer collects the cards and hands them to the moderator, and the moderator chooses which questions are most worth hearing the answers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you all experienced anything like this?  How have you handled it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years after cartoons of the prophet Muhammad set off violent protests across the Muslim world, Islamic nations are mounting a campaign for an international treaty to protect religious symbols and beliefs from mockery – essentially a ban on blasphemy that would put them on a collision course with free speech laws in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:soqufzbALk8FeM:http://www.familycourtchronicles.com/marriage/ban-marriage-big.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:soqufzbALk8FeM:http://www.familycourtchronicles.com/marriage/ban-marriage-big.gif" alt="" width="120" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/20/texans-ban-all-marriage/"&gt;Texas bans all marriage&lt;/a&gt; – Religious fanatics aren’t the only ones who can slip nonsense into a bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the people of Texas passed a 2005 constitutional amendment to “protect” marriage, those clever, clever gays somehow forced them to word it poorly enough that it might prohibit ALL marriage in the state, &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/1340136.html"&gt;same-sex or otherwise&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment, approved by the Legislature and overwhelmingly ratified by voters, declares that “marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman.” But the troublemaking phrase, as Radnofsky sees it, is Subsection B, which declares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architects of the amendment included the clause to ban same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships. But Radnofsky, who was a member of the powerhouse Vinson &amp;amp; Elkins law firm in Houston for 27 years until retiring in 2006, says the wording of Subsection B effectively “eliminates marriage in Texas,” including common-law marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter has its points -- for example, when it accuses Randi of occasional grumpiness (It's true! He can be grumpy!) -- but the bulk of the thing is an attack upon Randi's character and qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/capt-photo_1258745293434-2-0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="capt.photo_1258745293434-2-0" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/capt-photo_1258745293434-2-0.jpg?w=399&amp;amp;h=266" alt="" width="399" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091120/ap_on_sc/eu_sci_big_bang_machine"&gt;Europe: Proton beams circulate in Big Bang machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENEVA – Scientists switched on the world’s largest atom smasher Friday night for the first time since the $10 billion machine suffered a spectacular failure more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a year of repairs before beams of protons circulated late Friday in the Large Hadron Collider for the first time since it was heavily damaged by a simple electrical fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circulation of the beams was a significant leap forward. The European Organization for Nuclear Research has taken the restart of the collider step by step to avoid further setbacks as it moves toward new scientific experiments — probably starting in January — regarding the makeup of matter and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as I’ve blogged about before, where there is science being done by physicists via particle accelerators like the LHC, there are also &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt; nuts who maintain that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_particle_collisions_at_the_Large_Hadron_Collider"&gt;it’s going to destroy the Earth.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Balderdash! &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/three-reasons-why-the-large-hadron-collider-will-not-destroy-the-earth/"&gt;Here are 3 good reasons why the LHC experiments are no danger to our planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also point out one more piece of good news regarding the re-starting of the LHC: despite all of the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/doomsday.html"&gt;doomsday scenarios&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Conspiracy_Theory"&gt;conspiracy-mongering&lt;/a&gt; pseudoscientists – the Earth survived &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/falling_into_a_black_hole_suck.php"&gt;week&lt;/a&gt;, and I've always wondered something.  When you fall into a black hole, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/falling_into_a_black_hole_suck.php"&gt;all sorts of strange things happen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/believe_it_or_not_a_black_hole/black-holes.jpg" width="500" title="You&amp;#39;ll stay away if you know what&amp;#39;s good for you!" alt="black-holes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most well-known one is that nothing -- not even &lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt; -- can ever escape once it falls in.  Well, my question is, if &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; fell in to a black hole, as you crossed the event horizon in your sturdy, well-lit spaceship, would the lights stay on or would they go out as you crossed into the black hole?  (Ignoring the tidal forces that would rip you and the spaceship apart.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/believe_it_or_not_a_black_hole/131183.jpg" width="500" title="Yes, this picture is from Futurama!" alt="131183.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you've read the first 1497 pages of the Count of Monte Cristo as you cross the event horizon; will you be able to finish your book with your last remaining moments?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Feel free to discuss below; I'll post the answer with an explanation on Monday!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/believe_it_or_not_a_black_hole.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258763177582"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/medical_matters_h1n1_science_i.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84ccde8ea412ba35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="H1N1 Novel Swine Flu"/><title type="html">Medical Matters: H1N1, Science Ignorance and Cancer Screening</title><published>2009-11-21T00:03:51Z</published><updated>2009-11-21T00:03:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/nKODwOxq6xs/medical_matters_h1n1_science_i.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/medical_matters_h1n1_science_i.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a few non-authoritative comments regarding recent and current medical developments.

When you watch someone fall into a black hole, what you actually &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; is pretty surprising.  You see, a black hole's gravity distorts the space around it, and it does so &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; providing any light of its own, giving you a unique perspective on the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/falling_into_a_black_hole_suck/black%20hole%20distortion.jpg" width="500" title="An artist&amp;#39;s rendition, of course, but the way the image was generated uses all of the correct physics!" alt="black hole distortion.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you watch someone else fall in, you'd see them approach the black hole normally, and then the bizarreness starts.  As they go deeper and deeper into the gravitational field of the black hole, a few super bizarre things all start to happen simultaneously.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/falling_into_a_black_hole_suck/dec07_1_10.gif" width="500" title="As you get closer to the event horizon, spacetime is curved more severely..." alt="dec07_1_10.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The light coming from the person gets redshifted; they'll start to take on a redder hue and then, eventually, will require infrared, microwave, and then radio "vision" to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speed at which they appear to fall in will get asymptotically slow; they will appear to fall in towards the event horizon at a slower and slower speed, never quite reaching it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;amount&lt;/i&gt; of light coming from them gets less and less.  In addition to getting redder, they also will appear dimmer, even if they emit their own source of light!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
But if you think that's bizarre, here's where it gets really weird: the person falling in notices &lt;i&gt;no difference&lt;/i&gt; in how time passes or how light appears to them.  They would continue to fall in to the black hole and cross the event horizon as though nothing happened.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you see if &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; fell into this black hole?  Luckily, Andrew Hamilton and his group at Colorado have created a video (and an &lt;i&gt;accurate&lt;/i&gt; video at that) to illustrate this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/8s-pWPqFQBE%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's not even counting what the tidal forces would do to you as you fell in, which includes (in chronological order):
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tearing your extremities (head, arms, legs) from your torso,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing the individual muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc., apart from your body,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing individual cells apart from one another,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing the organelles inside each cell apart, destroying cells themselves,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing the individual molecules apart into atoms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing your atoms apart into nuclei and electrons, and finally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing the individual nuclei apart into, eventually, quarks and gluons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Fun stuff, yes?  Perhaps someday, "death by black hole" will be commonplace, although it will take an infinite amount of time for you to see someone else experience it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/falling_into_a_black_hole_suck.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258756112693"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=7636">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7916056d3d5100a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="amateur astronomy"/><category term="Sirius Stargazing"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Sirius Stargazing</title><published>2009-11-20T21:00:31Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T21:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/20/sirius-stargazing/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have few regrets in life, but if there’s one, it’s that I didn’t have access to all this amazing technology when I was a teenager and figuring out just how I was going to tackle my love for astronomy. How I would have loved podcasts, programmable telescopes, CCDs, websites with satellite pass information…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the way things are now, and lots of people are putting this tech to good use. Like, for example, Sirius Stargazing, a new YouTube channel with info on how to observe various astronomical objects. It’s just starting out but off to a good start. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzivRcbV9Lc"&gt;Here’s one video on the Pleiades&lt;/a&gt;. And who’s the dork in the tie introducing it?&lt;/p&gt;

A year off after having a baby, the first 39 weeks of which are paid for by your employer. In addition, the mother is entitled to 13 weeks unpaid leave until the child is five. That is of course incredibly fantastic for the mother and child, and a very good incentive for large companies who want to encourage valued female staff to return to work after, but a minefield for small companies like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, if I employed a woman who became pregnant, and she decided to take the full year off, I would be able to afford to pay the maternity leave because that is budgeted for in her salary, but probably wouldn’t be able to afford to replace her for that time. Why? Because short-term contracts in skilled roles command a much higher rate than permanent salaries. You swap job security and longevity for a greater short-term return. I’d be paying the new mother’s maternity leave for 39 weeks (I’d get that back from the government, and in some cases some compensation, but I’d still make a loss), and probably double that for 52 weeks for an equally experienced and skilled temp, plus my recruitment and HR costs on top. I could pay more than the minimum statutory maternity leave, but that wouldn’t be paid back by the government. But of course, in recruitment terms, I am more likely to attract decent candidates if I offer a generous maternity package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hired someone unskilled at a lower rate for a 12-month contract, I couldn’t afford to take the time out to train them up to standard, and couldn’t afford the risk if they turned out to be no good. Equally, I couldn’t afford to be without someone in that role for a year. So what do I do? There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that many small companies in my position simply avoid employing women of child-bearing age. I am not a jerk, and wouldn’t discriminate that way, but I do have to protect my business over and above the “nice-to-have” ideal of supporting a member of staff after she has a baby. It hasn’t happened yet, partly because I don’t employ any permanent full-time staff (my staff are all freelancers), but as my company grows and I become closer to bringing in permanent staff, I am aware that the impact on my business would be greater than the benefit of supporting the employee through the first year of her child’s life. This is a dilemma. I would not legally be allowed to make that employee redundant, unless I could prove it was for reasons other than the pregnancy. Neither would I want to – if I employ someone I’d like it to be for a long time, through whatever lifestyle choices that person makes. Such working relationships are invaluable, and I’m not a jerk. But having a member of staff away for a year could be crippling in many ways, and I am not the only small-business owner to express concerns. I’ve yet to find a solution to this I’m comfortable with. While very generous maternity rights help women work whilst having families, they also encourage small employers to discriminate based on risk. Such discrimination is wrong and illegal, but I can see why it happens. If the individual employer was free to offer a maternity package based on its own factors, then the market would decide. If it was a crappy package, the company would fail to attract certain candidates. But if the basic salary was higher as a reflection, then they might attract, for example, women like me who don’t plan to have children. I’d happily give up rights I don’t intend to use in return for a greater remuneration. I still can’t decide if that would be worse than the status quo, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are maternity leave rights too generous, not generous enough, or should they be up to the individual employer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember how people insisted that the gays were trying to ruin marriage?  Well, they succeeded in Texas.  When the people of Texas passed a 2005 constitutional amendment to “protect” marriage, those clever, clever gays somehow forced them to word it poorly enough that it might prohibit ALL marriage in the state, &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/1340136.html"&gt;same-sex or otherwise&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment, approved by the Legislature and overwhelmingly ratified by voters, declares that “marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman.” But the troublemaking phrase, as Radnofsky sees it, is Subsection B, which declares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architects of the amendment included the clause to ban same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships. But Radnofsky, who was a member of the powerhouse Vinson &amp;amp; Elkins law firm in Houston for 27 years until retiring in 2006, says the wording of Subsection B effectively “eliminates marriage in Texas,” including common-law marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, yes, I &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;believe that legal recognition of marriage is a legal status “identical or similar to marriage.”  By definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How in the world did that slip by people?  It’s a pretty big deal.  They might need a new constitutional amendment to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely legal to stop recognizing civil marriages.  The people (through the governmental processes) can decide what relationships to grant special recognition and benefits.  They decided to stop granting benefits to any relationships.  Kudos for leveling the playing field for all sexual orientations, Texas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing it’s not what the people of Texas thought they were agreeing to.  Their best options are an activist judge and revising their governing document.  Which idea do you think offends Texans more?&lt;/p&gt;

There is no atheist/humanist billboard innocuous enough that it won't draw protests.  If an atheist organization put up a billboard that merely said, "Have a nice day!", I'm sure there would be all sorts of objections.  "We don't need that in our community -- God decides what kind of day it is!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the final phase of the BHA's bus campaign, in which a billboard with a picture of a child simply reads, "Please Don't Label Me. Let Me Grow Up And Choose For Myself," surrounded by a bunch of possible "labels" that people might wrongly apply to a child ("Christian child", "Muslim child", "Mormon child", "Atheist child", etc.), is &lt;a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/humanist-poster-stirs-up-religious-storm-14566599.html"&gt;drawing fiery objections from religious leaders in Belfast&lt;/a&gt;.  You'd think that asking people not to label their children would be uncontroversial, but I guess not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the objections miss the point -- "How dare you tell us how to raise our children!" -- but one which &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; take the point head-on also happens to be the most disturbing.  From Sheikh Anwar Mady of the Belfast Islamic Centre:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that every child is born as a Muslim. Religion is not given by the family, but it is a natural religion given by our God at birth. The role of the family is to teach the traditions of the faith. But that faith is implanted at birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, his contention is that &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; child ought to be labelled a "Muslim child".

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/1340136.html"&gt;Texas’ gay marriage ban may have banned all marriages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By Dave Montgomery&lt;br&gt;
Fort Worth Star-Telegram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN — Texans: Are you really married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Ann Radnofsky, a Houston lawyer and Democratic candidate for attorney general, says that a 22-word clause in a 2005 constitutional amendment designed to ban gay marriages erroneously endangers the legal status of all marriages in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment, approved by the Legislature and overwhelmingly ratified by voters, declares that “marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman.” But the troublemaking phrase, as Radnofsky sees it, is Subsection B, which declares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we’re not likely to see the dismantling of marriages across Texas, but according to Radnofsky, the clear language of Subsection B brings up legal questions about spousal rights, insurance claims, inheritance, and more.

That is, simply by improving your current diet and increasing your daily physical activity will make you healthier and reduce your chance of countless diseases regardless of whether or not the number on your scale budges. However, the huge caveat to this notion is that individuals who adopt these healthy behaviours AND manage to lose at least 5-10% of their weight will benefit the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, while we often suggest that people look beyond the bathroom scale when adopting a healthy lifestyle, a number of studies have shown that the regular use of a scale may actually be helpful when it comes to losing weight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, Vanwormer and colleagues nicely summarized the effect of regular weighing on weight loss in a systematic review of the literature published just last year. They included a total of 12 individual studies in their final analysis and found a number of interesting trends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evidence from 11 of the 12 studies suggested that more frequent self-weighing was associated with greater weight loss or weight gain prevention, with those individuals who weighed themselves daily or weekly having about a 1-3kg weight loss lead on their non-weighing counterparts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A more recent prospective cohort study (2009) by the same authors provides further evidence of the positive effect of regular self-weighing on weight-loss success. In this study, 100 obese subjects were enrolled in a 6 month behavioural weight-loss program (consisting of telephone counseling and a written manual) which encouraged subjects to regularly weigh themselves. The study found that participants lost an additional 1 pound of weight for every 11 days they weighed-themselves. Looking at the data another way, individuals who weighed themselves at least weekly were more than 10 times as likely to reach a weight-loss of 5% (considered the cut-point for clinically significant weight loss) at the end of the 6 month intervention.&lt;br&gt;Thus, self-monitoring of your weight may be helpful if weight-loss is your goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it is a VERY rare occurrence that we actually like a product, a new gadget I came across online while in Vancouver actually struck me as rather neat – especially given what I described above.

As people are also no doubt aware the breaking into of computers and releasing private information is illegal, and regardless of how they were obtained, posting private correspondence without permission is unethical. We therefore aren’t going to post any of the emails here. We were made aware of the existence of this archive last Tuesday morning when the hackers attempted to upload it to RealClimate, and we notified CRU of their possible security breach later that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, these emails (a presumably careful selection of (possibly edited?) correspondence dating back to 1996 and as recently as Nov 12) are being widely circulated, and therefore require some comment. Some of them involve people here (and the archive includes the first RealClimate email we ever sent out to colleagues) and include discussions we’ve had with the CRU folk on topics related to the surface temperature record and some paleo-related issues, mainly to ensure that posting were accurate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since emails are normally intended to be private, people writing them are, shall we say, somewhat freer in expressing themselves than they would in a public statement. For instance, we are sure it comes as no shock to know that many scientists do not hold Steve McIntyre in high regard. Nor that a large group of them thought that the Soon and Baliunas (2003), Douglass et al (2008) or McClean et al (2009) papers were not very good (to say the least) and should not have been published. These sentiments have been made abundantly clear in the literature (though possibly less bluntly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting is what is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contained in the emails.  There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy, no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research, no grand plan to ‘get rid of the MWP’, no admission that global warming is a hoax, no evidence of the falsifying of data, and no ‘marching orders’ from our socialist/communist/vegetarian overlords. The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being in on the plot though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, there is a peek into how scientists actually interact and the conflicts show that the community is a far cry from the monolith that is sometimes imagined. People working constructively to improve joint publications; scientists who are friendly and agree on many of the big picture issues, disagreeing at times about details and engaging in ‘robust’ discussions; Scientists expressing frustration at the misrepresentation of their work in politicized arenas and complaining when media reports get it wrong; Scientists resenting the time they have to take out of their research to deal with over-hyped nonsense. None of this should be shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that the noise-generating components of the blogosphere will generate a lot of noise about this. but it’s important to remember that science doesn’t work because people are polite at all times. Gravity isn’t a useful theory because Newton was a nice person. QED isn’t powerful because Feynman was respectful of other people around him. Science works because different groups go about trying to find the best approximations of the truth, and are generally very competitive about that. That the same scientists can still all agree on the wording of an IPCC chapter for instance is thus even more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt, instances of cherry-picked and poorly-worded “gotcha” phrases will be pulled out of context. One example is worth mentioning quickly. Phil Jones in discussing the presentation of temperature reconstructions stated that “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.” The paper in question is the Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1998) Nature paper on the original multiproxy temperature reconstruction, and the ‘trick’ is just to plot the instrumental records along with reconstruction so that the context of the recent warming is clear. Scientists often use the term “trick” to refer to a “a good way to deal with a problem”, rather than something that is “secret”, and so there is nothing problematic in this at all. As for the ‘decline’, it is well known that Keith Briffa’s maximum latewood tree ring density proxy diverges from the temperature records after 1960 (this is more commonly known as the “divergence problem”–see e.g. the recent discussion in &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/progress-in-millennial-reconstructions/"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;) and has been discussed in the literature since Briffa et al in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 1998 (Nature, 391, 678-682). Those authors have always recommend not using the post 1960 part of their reconstruction, and so while ‘hiding’ is probably a poor choice of words (since it is ‘hidden’ in plain sight), not using the data in the plot is completely appropriate, as is further research to understand why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of this particular episode is probably not coincidental. But if cherry-picked out-of-context phrases from stolen personal emails is the only response to the weight of the scientific evidence for the human influence on climate change, then there probably isn’t much to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course lessons to be learned. Clearly no-one would have gone to this trouble if the academic object of study was the mating habits of European butterflies. That community’s internal discussions are probably safe from the public eye. But it is important to remember that emails do seem to exist forever, and that there is always a chance that they will be inadvertently released. Most people do not act as if this is true, but they probably should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to point fingers and declare that people should not have been so open with their thoughts, but who amongst us would really be happy to have all of their email made public? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let he who is without PIN cast the the first stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The official UEA statement is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We are aware that information from a server used for research information&lt;br&gt;
in one area of the university has been made available on public websites,”&lt;br&gt;
the spokesman stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of the volume of this information we cannot currently confirm&lt;br&gt;
that all of this material is genuine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This information has been obtained and published without our permission&lt;br&gt;
and we took immediate action to remove the server in question from&lt;br&gt;
operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are undertaking a thorough internal investigation and we have involved&lt;br&gt;
the police in this enquiry.”

In recent days they have gotten it half way around the 27 km circumference, and within hours, they should be able to circulate it and I assume “capture” it with the RF, which creates stable bunches in the synchrotron.  Everything has gone very smoothly to this point, so I expect success shortly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once beam has circulated stably in both rings, some time next week the LHC team will attempt to collide protons at the injection energy of 450 GeV (a total center of mass energy of 900 GeV).  While this is much less than the Tevatron is colliding presently, it could provide some sorely needed initial data for the detectors to do timing and calibration of the various subsystems.   There will even hopefully be a few collision events recorded with clear “dijet” structure – collisions where quarks and/or gluons inside the protons hit head on and effectively bounce sideways into the detector, giving two back-to-back collimated sprays of particles.  Pictures of such events will be great to see, at long last!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow progress live on twitter: http://twitter.com/cern and I will update this post as I learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:32 PST: The LHC has gotten beam around clockwise, to Point 6!  Woo hoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:45 PST: Magnet quench – should be recovered soon…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:25 PST: Beam has reached Point 7!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:30 PST: Point 8!  Next beam will be sent past Point 1 where ATLAS is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:39 PST  Beam all the way around the ring!   WOO HOO!!  It’s baaaaaack!  The LHC Page 1 display shows that the injection probe beam made it more than once around the machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/11/lhc1-orbits.gif" alt="lhc1-orbits" title="lhc1-orbits" width="512"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:54 PST:  Next goals: do the same with the counterclockwise beam.  Will they attempt RF capture tonight?  Trying to find out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13:11 PST: Turns out (no pun intended) they decided to go for RF capture of the clockwise beam rather than probe counterclockwise.  They are up to 10 million turns with the RF on!  Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13:30 PST: Having captured the beam for several minutes, the LHC will now switch to counterclockwise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:53 PST: About to go for a full orbit of the counterclockwise beam…done!!  Now to RF capture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:30 PST: Counterclockwise beam is RF captured!  The LHC is operational…colliding beams within a week?  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258739822553"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-5615032184365145540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76893c0af845c30d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="movies" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="musings" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">New Moon</title><published>2009-11-20T17:09:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T17:24:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-moon.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/5615032184365145540/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=5615032184365145540&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">So I somehow got talked into going to see the new Twilight movie, "New Moon" last night. As I've mentioned before, I like midnight showings. Like many other big events, there's an energy to them that just makes them more exciting. Usually, it's hard to really find a good term to describe that energy. But last night it was easy: Estrogen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeebus there was a lot of it. I expected that there would be a lot of teenage girls there, but the ratio was &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; steeper than I expected. I'm pretty sure it was close to a 40:1 ratio. Whenever Edward or Jacob came on screen it was a screaming and swooning reminiscent of the legends I hear about the Beatles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the director (or writers in some cases I suppose) milked it. "Oh, Bella. You hit your head on a rock? Let me take my shirt off to dab at it for a few seconds and not bother to compress it at all."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Hurk*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I'm Edward and I'm so emo that I'm going to go all Romeo by exposing myself to the public as a sparkly freak by slowly stripping as I walk down a hall into the sunlight while wearing my 'sensitive' face.... in slow motion."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I watch anime. I'm used to fan service. But damn was this over the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still can't fathom why people like this series. I haven't read the book, but everything in the plot is cliche++.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I love you and I'm afraid I'm going to hurt you so I'm going to push you away." x2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I'm going to do it by telling you I don't love you anymore and you're stupid enough to fall for it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to watch the end of Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet right at the beginning and then try to pull a Romeo.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And let's not forget the plot holes where Bella is brought before the Vampire high council and none of their powers work on her (like Edwards don't). So the conclusion is supposedly drawn that Bella is immune to all vampires.... except that Jasper's (I only remember his name because there's a character in 101 Dalmatians with the same name) powers work on her....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2008/11/attention_twilight_girls.php"&gt;this movie has nothing to offer that hasn't been done better elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at least this movie wasn't as bad as the first one.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5615032184365145540?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258739822545"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-2219085476214980058">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dfb467dd185c4a43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="law" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="religion" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="stupidity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">God the Hitman?</title><published>2009-11-20T16:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T17:09:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/11/god-hitman.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/2219085476214980058/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=2219085476214980058&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">As I've understood it, the point of prayer is generally to make a request of God to perform an action on your behalf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Shrug*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever. We ask for help with things all the time. But generally, it's from people that can actually do something (again, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html&amp;amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26orefQ3Dslogin&amp;amp;OP=1fadc0f4Q2FYIQ26oYRfTBmff!HYHVVQ27YVQ2FYQ2FWYwQ261Q7D!wYQ2FWQ20m1Q2AZw!Q23Q7D"&gt;prayer doesn't work&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when we ask someone real to commit murder, it's a crime. It doesn't matter if they're &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; going to do it or not. If someone attempts to persuade someone else to kill someone, regardless of the effectiveness of that person or the final outcome, it's a crime. And not one that should be laughed off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what should we make of &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/2009/11/evangelist-religious-trawling-assassins/"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; in which some Christians are touting merchandise that reads: Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8. Psmalm 109.8 reads, "Let his days be few; and let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, they want Obama dead and they're asking someone (that they claim is real) to make it happen. The "how" isn't mentioned, but if someone was talking to a real person, it wouldn't have to. It's still a felony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm still not entirely sure how I feel on this. I already knew people like this were delusional, but this is right up on the border of dangerous.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-2219085476214980058?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258739682543"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1783">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5fd60e924fe1014f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="funny"/><category term="humor"/><category term="Jon Ronson"/><category term="Little kitten"/><category term="The Men Who Stare at Goats"/><category term="Vegemite"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Little Kitten – Marmite Bites With Jon Ronson</title><published>2009-11-20T16:21:33Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T16:21:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/HsaSppNaTXk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2009/11/little-kitten-marmite-bites-with-jon-ronson/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like someone was doing some recording at TAM London for the anti-Vegemite!

You can access the main paper in Science, and there’s a very neat diagram in figure 1 that is like looking across time at the sequence data and into the corn nebula.  But the thing that cracked me up was this line from the abstract:

Nearly 85% of the genome is composed of hundreds of families of transposable elements, dispersed nonuniformly across the genome.

That means 85% of corn isn’t corn!!  And what business do those elements have messing with the genomes??  I am told all the time that messing with plant genomes is wrong and unnatural.  Heh.

For full coverage of the big news today I’ll point you to James and the Giant Corn (appropriately enough) who seems to be the CNN (Corn News Network) of 24-hour coverage of many aspects of the work.

I spent my morning looking over the PLoS Maize Special Collection papers, including the intriguing appetizer:  10 Reasons to be Tantalized by the B73 Maize Genome.  But I spent longer looking at the CNVs and PAVs paper.  I’ve been thinking about CNVs a lot  lately, and was interested to see this covered in a non-mammalian species.

Figure 1 is a nice example of how to use VISTA for effective displays in comparative genomics.  (If you haven’t used VISTA before you might check out our sponsored free tutorial on that–we are currently working with the VISTA team to update that with their new features too.)

There’s a really striking segment of chromosome 6 that appears to be present in one of the strains they examine and absent in the other (illustrated in figure 4).  And it looks like it has genes that are expressed and active in the B73 strain.  The ongoing investigation of that is pretty intriguing as well.

The structural variations are not evenly distributed across the genomes.  Some places have large occurrences, and some are untouched.  It’s clear that just in these two strains there’s a lot more structural diversity than in other species that have been examined:

In the human, rat, dog, mouse, macaque and chimpanzee genomes the average number of CNVs between two individuals is between 15 and 75 [43]–[48]. A high resolution study of eight human genomes [49] revealed only several hundred insertions and deletions, including CNV and PAV sequences, in the comparison of any two human genomes. In contrast, even after very stringent filtering we identified &amp;gt;3,700 CNV or PAV sequences that represent at least 2,000 events between these two maize genomes.

Emphasis mine.  Plants are so much more flexible, apparently….

This is going to lead to some neat clues on heterosis (or hybrid vigor) as the research proceeds with these new tools.  What a great time to be a plant scientist.  There are some very exciting projects coming along with the tools of genomics.

What I couldn’t locate was any reference to a CNV database (like DGV or CHOP CNV) where you can examine the whole set.  I’ll dig through the supplement data to see if I can find out more on that.  But I wanted get this post out to celebrate the very nice work and collection of papers on this project. Congrats to the teams involved!

How do non-religious parents differ from religious ones?Here&amp;#39;s a study by Bart Duriez, from the Catholic University Leuven in Belgium, which looks into just that. He quizzed over 900 secondary school students in Belgium about their religious attitudes and their parents approaches to parenting. He also asked their parents the same questions.Duriez used a rather nifty measure of religion, specially developed at the Center for Developmental Psychology in Leuven. It separates Christian beliefs along two dimensions: how strong is their belief in the transcendent, and how literal (or fundamentalist) are their beliefs.Their measured four different aspects of parenting style: support, regulation, extrinsic goal promotion (i.e. wealth, popularity, good looks), and conservation goal promotion (i.e. conformity and tradition).So... drum roll... who makes better parents?Well, it turns out that there was no difference between atheists and strong religious believers on the amount of support given to children, how much parental control there was, and whether the parents promoted so-called &amp;#39;materialist&amp;#39; ideas (extrinsic goals).But there was a strong an consistent difference on conservation goal promotion. Religious parents were more likely to promote conformity and tradition, rather than openness to change. Previous studies have found that a parental focus on goal conservation leads to decreased well-being and increased authoritarianism.You might expect that fundamentalists were more conservative, but this study didn&amp;#39;t find that. Biblical literalism was not independently related to conservation goal promotion.It&amp;#39;s the  the intensity of beliefs, rather than the parents&amp;#39; so-called &amp;#39;cognitive style&amp;#39;, that matters. Where biblical literalism did have an effect was on materialism - fundamentalists were less worldly.Previous studies have found a link between religion and parental control, and Duriez &amp;amp; Co speculate that their failure to find the same may be a statistical aberration. They conclude:... although adolescents of religious parents may be less likely to engage in problem behaviors, this might be accompanied by a rigid and closed-minded functioning.So, who makes better parents? It depends what you mean by &amp;#39;better&amp;#39;.____________________________________________________________________Duriez, B., Soenens, B., Neyrinck, B., &amp;amp; Vansteenkiste, M. (2009).

There will be many reasons for being cautious in implementing the suggestions of the authors, but bad research is not one of them. One of the difficult things about this paper is that the authors are very good about identifying potential confounding influences. They explain that there are many factors that may have affected the results. They are thorough in pointing out the many different ways they analyzed the data to try to minimize any potential confounding influences. While many may look at this study, see the amount of doubt the authors express throughout the study, and conclude that there is too much uncertainty to pay any attention to this study, they would be wrong to do so.Trusting in the certainty of those promoting the Golden Hour is the true error. Anxious exhortations to Panic! and Faster! and Panic faster! are not substitutes for good patient care.The Golden Hour has been around for decades. This is the idea that seriously injured patients need to receive definitive care within 60 minutes of that serious injury. The amount of information used by Dr. R Adams Cowley to concoct the Golden Hour could fit onto a cocktail napkin. According to legend, it was dreamed up in a bar, so maybe it did fit onto a cocktail napkin. The Golden Hour is not science. The Golden Hour is marketing, and very successful marketing. There are still plenty of people citing the Golden Hour as their excuse for all sorts of mistreatment of patients - But we have to get them to the trauma center inside the Golden Hour. A more appropriate term is the Bogus Hour.The commonly used 8 minute response time (or 8 minutes 59 second response time in some places) limit (in at least 90% of responses) is based on the AHA&amp;#39;s (American Heart Association&amp;#39;s) Chain of Survival. The interesting thing is that cardiac arrest survival appears to be the only condition that has good science supporting a short response time.To date, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remain the only ﬁeld-based patient population with a consistent association between time (response interval) and survival.18,19[2]The authors of this study probably looked at far more data on trauma time intervals than any other study. They evaluated the data in as many different ways as they could think of, to see if there were any ways that there could be a connection between prehospital time and survival. In spite of all of these different ways of evaluating the data, the conclusion based on all of the evidence is - time does not make a significant difference in survival for unstable trauma patients.This was not a study just looking at all trauma patients, the patients meeting only anatomic criteria were not included. The same is true for patients only meeting mechanism criteria. In other words, they excluded most of the patients transported to trauma centers. Why? Because these patients do not have serious enough injuries to expect time to make a difference. Even though these patients are rushed to trauma centers, their injuries have not resulted in unstable vital signs/level of consciousness. Therefore, they are not considered to have significant injuries for the purposes of this study.Here are some representative anatomic criteria and mechanism criteria for trauma triage - Anatomic Criteria:• Penetrating injury to head, neck, torso and extremities proximal to elbow or knee (unless obviously superficial)• Chest injuries with respiratory distress (for example, flail chest)• Two or more proximal long-bone (humerus or femur) fractures• Pelvic fractures• Limb paralysis (spinal cord injury)• Amputation proximal to wrist or ankle[3]None of these qualify to get the patient into the study - shooting, stabbing, nibbled at by a lion, - unless the patient has signs of being unstable. Mechanism of Injury:• Death of another occupant in same vehicle• Auto vs. pedestrian (bicycle) injury with significant impact• Pedestrian thrown or run over• Extrication time &amp;gt; 20 minutes• Falls from &amp;gt; 20 feet• Ejection from vehicle• Vehicle rollover• High-energy vehicle crash (e.g. significant intrusion intopassenger compartment)• Motorcycle crash with separation of rider from motorcycleOther factors combined with traumatic injuries:• Age &amp;lt; 5 years or &amp;gt; 55 years• Combination of trauma with burns• Known heart disease, CHF, or COPD• Known bleeding disorder or taking coumadin/ heparin• Pregnancy (&amp;gt;20 weeks)• Rigid or diffusely tender abdomen• Amputation of fingers with possibility of reattachment[3]These are the kind of criteria that Maryland was using to fly patients. When they had their fatal crash last year, these mechanism criteria required permission from medical command to fly patients. Flights dropped by about two thirds and outcomes do not appear to have changed. Few of these criteria are useful for predicting instability. This study was only concerned with patients who really are unstable, not those with significant damage to their cars or trucks.So, what is unstable in the study?The criteria from the study - Injured patients with one or more of the following criteria were included: systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than or equal to 90 mmHg, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than or equal to 12, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 29 breaths/min, or advanced airway intervention (tracheal intubation, supraglottic airway, or cricothyrotomy). “Injury” was broadly deﬁned as any blunt, penetrating, or burn mechanism for which the EMS provider(s) believed trauma to be the primary clinical insult.[2]And still they have 10 physiologically unstable patients per day, if averaged over a year - with a few left over. Remember, this is after excluding most of the patients who would automatically be flown to trauma centers, because the authors do not believe that those patients are injured enough for time to make a difference in their outcomes.Editor’s Capsule SummaryWhat is already known on this topic The “golden hour” concept in trauma is pervasive despite little evidence  to support it.What question this study addressedIs there an association between various emergency medical services (EMS) intervals and in hospital mortality in seriously injured adults?What this study adds to our knowledgeIn 3,656 injured patients with substantial perturbations of vital signs or mental status, transported by 146 EMS agencies to 51 trauma centers across North America, no association was found among any EMS interval and mortality.How this might change clinical practiceThis study suggests that in our current out-of-hospital and emergency care system time may be less crucial than once thought. Routine lights-and-sirens transport for trauma patients, with its inherent risks, may not be warranted.[2]So, if time is not making a difference in survival, maybe we should stop killing people just to get patients to the hospital a little bit faster. Some more details from the paper - . . . total EMS time was not associated with mortality . . . for every minute of total time . . . When the sample was assessed with 10-minute increments for total EMS time, there was no evidence of increased mortality with increasing ﬁeld times . . . Similar results were obtained when total times were grouped by quartile . . . We were also unable to demonstrate independent associations between mortality and any other EMS interval for the overall sample . . . [2]No matter how they broke down the time intervals, there was no detectable change in outcome.For categorized response interval, there was no association with mortality for patients with a 4- to 8-minute interval . . . or greater than 8-minute interval . . . compared with patients with a response less than 4 minutes.[2]The same for response times.In multivariable logistic regression models, there was no demonstrable association between time and mortality for any subgroup.[2]Although some seriously injured individuals may require time-dependent EMS interventions to survive (eg, airway obstruction, respiratory arrest, external hemorrhage at a compressible site), faster application of such interventions may not have a measureable effect on outcomes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	In the case of reading, the shapes of our writing systems have evolved towards a progressive simplification while remaining compatible with the visual coding scheme that is present in all primate brains. A fascinating discovery, made by the American researcher Marc Changizi, is that all of the world&amp;#39;s writing systems use the same set of basic shapes, and that these shapes are already a part of the visual system in all primates, because they are also useful for coding natural visual scenes. The monkey brain already contains neurons that preferentially respond to an “alphabet” of shapes including T, L, Y. We merely “recycle” these shapes (and the corresponding part of cortex) and turn them into a cultural code for language.
	
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-brain-on-books&amp;amp;page=2"&gt;How literacy changes the brain&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are starting to do brain-imaging experiments in illiterates, and we find that this region, before it responds to words, has a preference for pictures of objects and faces. We are also finding that this region is especially attuned to small features present in the contours of natural shapes, such as the “Y” shape in the branches of trees. My hypothesis is our letters emerged from a recycling of those shapes at the cultural level. The brain didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to evolve “for” reading – so writing systems evolved “for” the brain! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-brain-on-books&amp;amp;page=2"&gt;On the scientific bankruptcy of whole-language (and balanced literacy)&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	In the case of reading, very concretely, as I explain in the book, we now have plenty of evidence that the whole-language approach has nothing to do with how our visual system recognizes written words – our brain never relies on the overall contours of words, rather it decomposes all of its letters and graphemes in parallel, subliminally and at a high speed, thus giving us an illusion of whole-word reading. Experiments even suggest that the whole-language method may orient learning towards the wrong brain region, symmetrical to the visual word form area in the right hemisphere! We need to inform our teaching with the best brain science – and we also need to develop evidence-based education research, using classroom experiments to verify that our deductions about teaching methods actually work in practice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-brain-on-books&amp;amp;page=3"&gt;On dyslexia&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This isn&amp;#39;t fully known, but I was intrigued by recent research which indicates that dyslexic children and adults can be better on tasks of symmetry detection – they have a greater ability to notice the presence of symmetrical patterns, and the evidence even suggests that this was helpful in a group of astrophysicists to detect the symmetrical spectrum of black holes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory is that mirror recognition is one of the functions that we have to partially “un-learn” when we learn to read – it is a universal feature of the primate brain that is, unfortunately, inappropriate in our alphabet where letters p, q, d and b abound. By somehow managing to maintain this ability, dyslexics might be at some advantage in visual, spatial or even mathematical tasks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences hosts the final offering of its Charles Darwin Lecture Series on Tuesday, November 24 -- the 150th anniversary of Darwin's landmark publication of "The Origin of Species." Join Museum paleontologist and science historian Paul Brinkman for a free presentation titled "Charles Darwin's Beagle Voyage and the Origin of 'The Origin.'"

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brinkman completed his PhD in History of Science at the University of Minnesota with research in the history of 19th-century natural sciences, especially geology and paleontology. He has published a number of articles on Darwin, museum history, and the history of American vertebrate paleontology. His second book, The Second American Jurassic Dinosaur Rush, is due out next year from the University of Chicago Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP to museum.reservations@ncmail.net -- be sure to specify the event name and date. This lecture is free of charge and seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. Doors to the Museum and auditorium will open at 6:00 pm and the presentation will begin at 6:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum, in collaboration with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and the W.M. Keck Center for Behavioral Biology at North Carolina State University, has presented several talks throughout 2009 to commemorate the bicentennial of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."

Almost simultaneously, a copy of the Comfort book–for it is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;Darwin–showed up in the office of the Knight Science Journalism Program here at MIT. Clearly, these books are being deftly circulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Science Education is refuting Comfort’s &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/"&gt;staggeringly long and misleading introduction&lt;/a&gt;, so I needn’t say more about it. But flipping through the book, there was one highly dishonest aspect that struck me–&lt;em&gt;font size&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort’s introduction is in big font and nicely spaced. You can breeze through those fifty pages, almost like reading &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, Darwin’s text at the back is in tiny, cramped font, a real trial to get through. Gee, what part of the book do you think students are intended to read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised, even though I am. It appears creationists like Comfort will even stoop to manipulating font sizes in their arrogant and ignorant quest to undermine knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

When last I visited this topic, yesterday, I had intended it to be my last post for a while, perhaps ever. However, the amount of idiocy that I was dealing with became so overwhelming and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_makin_death_panels_for_your_mama.php"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; grew to even huger than Orac-ian proportions. So I decided to split the post into two parts, because the particular argument I'm about to discuss deserves its very own takedown. It also cleverly allowed me to post a big "TO BE CONTINUED..." and thereby nefariously manipulate my audience to be curious over whom the target of today's Insolence would be and thus more likely to pay me a return visit. Or not. Who knows? Either way, it let me make two long posts out of one gargantuan post. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those just joining the debate, I concluded &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_makin_death_panels_for_your_mama.php"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; by describing the claim that the USPSTF's recommendations were the equivalent of "death panels" and an example of the horrors that will come if the health insurance plan being debated in the Senate right now were to become law as the undead beast continuing to lumber on, using one of my favorite analogies, the brain-eating zombie, to describe how the whole "death panels" thing destroys any intelligent argument and renders its adherents stupid and/or ignorant, much the way certain varieties of brain-eating zombies do when they feast upon grey matter. In fact, as I said yesterday, the brain-eating death panel zombie even shows up in places where you wouldn't necessarily expect it. In this case, it appears to have eaten can eat the brains of bloggers that I used to consider fairly reasonable, creating new zombies. However, unlike the drooling "&lt;a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/11/17/feds-to-women-in-their-40s-skip-the-mammogram/"&gt;Hot Air&lt;/a&gt;"-type d&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-9100-Boston-Conservative-Independent-Examiner~y2009m11d17-Obamas-Breast-Cancer-Panel-is-a-true-Death-Panel-for-American-women"&gt;eath panel zombie&lt;/a&gt;, though, the new "death panel" zombies are more like the speedy, running zombies in &lt;em&gt;28 Days Later&lt;/em&gt;, not the shambling, dripping, drooling zombies of &lt;em&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em&gt;. They're the new, improved, cleverer zombie, like the ones in &lt;em&gt;The Return of the Living Dead&lt;/em&gt; who, after feasting on the brains of paramedics, picked up the radio from their ambulance and asked the dispatcher to send more paramedics. But at the heart, the zombie lie continues on, eating brains and reducing the level of debate from the merits of the recommendations as a matter of science and public to raw emotions manipulated by fear of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most disturbing to me all was that a blogger who really should know better than to use such brain-chomped terms to describe a complex issue, Dr. Rich, has fallen victim to the zombie, likening the USPSTF's recommendations to "&lt;a href="http://covertrationingblog.com/general-rationing-issues/breast-cancer-screening-and-soft-death-panels"&gt;soft death panels&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_fixin_death_panels_uspstf_mammography.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_fixin_death_panels_uspstf_mammography.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/MvyfDGd1HcY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258733725603"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18467">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25bb2340b27063f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: Atheist Meets Her Birth Mother 30 Years Later… She’s Religious</title><published>2009-11-20T16:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T16:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/20/ask-richard-atheist-meets-her-birth-mother-30-years-later%e2%80%a6-she%e2%80%99s-religious/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: When letter writers sign with their first names instead of a pseudonym or nickname, I randomly change their name for added anonymity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I met my biological mother (and siblings, etc.) for the first time at the age of 30. I had been corresponding with her, and one of my sisters, for about a year before hand, during which I found out that she was had a strong xtian faith. I had figured as much, as I was adopted through Catholic Charities. They all know I am an atheist, which is something I don’t hide — no one talks to me about it, or brings up their faith to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first birthday we shared, she got me &lt;em&gt;Blue Like Jazz&lt;/em&gt;, a book described as “non-religious thoughts on xtian spirituality” (I gave it away). For Xmas, I got a small, fold up manger decoration. I also got a copy of the book, &lt;em&gt;The Shack&lt;/em&gt;, but didn’t realize what it was about at the time. I figured that she was sharing things she enjoyed with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read &lt;em&gt;The Shack&lt;/em&gt;, I started to understand her way of thinking: her faith is not about dogma, just god/jesus’s perfect love and a personal relationship with god. Choosing to “live apart” from god is empty, incomplete, without love or trust, even rebellious- independent in a bad way. All of the explanations/apologetics illustrated how flawed the whole theory of god is. But because she takes god as a fact, and has always been comforted by faith, being without it is truly incomprehensible. I began to feel offended (not the best word) for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for Easter, I got a typical xtian card from her, but she had also written that she “hoped I would reconsider (god)”. It was only a one line note, but I was very bothered by it. I still can’t put my finger on WHY these things bothered me so much — but it did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed this with all my atheist friends, and a few that are not, but no one was sure what to do. I am outspoken, but mostly polite, and am baffled by what to do. I toyed with the idea of giving her an atheist philosophy book for every xtian one she gives me (what to give her?), but wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would like her to see that it is possible to be happy and complete without god/jesus. I would settle for never getting another xtian card.  She is not closed minded or hateful in any way, and I know she is doing this out of love- but it doesn’t make it acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you do? Any ideas why did the card/book bother me so much????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Stephanie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always hesitate to hypothesize on the thoughts and motives of  people.  Speculating about why someone thinks, feels or does something is a risky prospect.  Such suppositions should be accompanied by broad and frequent qualifiers. “Maybe, possibly, perhaps, I suppose, I imagine, it could be” keep us humble while playing at being mind readers.  We can only know our own minds, and often we’re strangers to parts of ourselves as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, even if we are correct, all we have to our question of why we or someone else thinks feels or does something, is a “because.”  Having that answer doesn’t automatically change anything. Changing things takes time and work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having some understanding about another’s motives can sometimes help us to find more patience and compassion for them. If we get an accurate glimpse of the emotions behind their actions, we have the chance to empathize, and empathy tends to make any relationship better.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding your own feelings about your mother’s gifts are linked to understanding what may be her motives. So I’ll begin with some highly conditional speculation about your mother first:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave you up for adoption under circumstances not stated here. Regardless, I imagine that it was very difficult and even painful for her. She may have a great deal of regret or guilt surrounding that.  Then 30 years later you reappear in her life, having been raised by someone else, having had experiences and influences beyond her control. She learns that you are an atheist.  She may think that this is one of the things that would have been different if she had been able to raise you. It might be a source of regret or guilt for her, as she wonders how you might have turned out differently.  “Would have, could have, and should have, if only” can torment people like harpies.   So possibly, she hopes to try to correct something that “went wrong” in her absence.  Perhaps, trying to make up for lost time, she wants to give you what she sees as a gift, her faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your description of your understanding of her beliefs, the statement “To live apart from God is empty, incomplete, without love” may hold some special insight into her experience. She had to live apart from &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; and it might have felt terribly empty, incomplete, and without love. She knows what that is like, and she doesn’t want that for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie, since main question of your letter is why are you increasingly perturbed by your mother’s religious gifts and remarks, now I’ll do some highly conditional speculation about you.  Please accept my apologies in advance if I’m way off, which is quite possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You described your feelings as, “offended, (not the best word)” and “very bothered.”  I wonder if your feelings could be summed up as “hurt.”  Perhaps you think she is making a statement about you by giving you these religious things, and you think it’s not a flattering statement, so your feelings are hurt. Maybe you think she’s saying that you are mistaken, or wrong, or foolish, or immature, or “rebellious-independent in a bad way,” or the worst thing she could possibly say: that now that she’s met you after 30 years, you are a disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch. That hurts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are only my speculations about your speculations about a third person’s possible statement hidden in her giving you gifts and cards, a statement that may not be be there at all.  As I said, guessing what’s in another’s mind this is a risky prospect. It’s probable that none of it is correct, and let’s hope so, because that’s a lot of unnecessary hurt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, these gifts are statements about &lt;em&gt;her,&lt;/em&gt; rather than you.  I think that if your mother has gone through and may still be going through just some of the painful things I’ve postulated, then it’s not likely that her religious gifts mean that she’s judging you disapprovingly.  Any disapproval or disappointment she is feeling is probably directed back onto herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you are on the right track when you say that you know she’s doing this out of love. I would only add that she’s doing it out of love, mixed with sadness, pain and regret, as well as hope for redemption.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you receive these things graciously, accepting them as her gestures of love. The only statement about you in them is that clearly, she thinks that you are worthy of love.  Enjoy them for that, then discard them, give them away, or put them in a box labeled “Bio Mom’s Love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that it is not a good idea for you to give her an atheist philosophy book for every Christian one she gives you, or any tit-for-tat kind of response. It seems clear that you want the relationship to increase in acceptance, not decrease. Sending unwanted things to her would most likely only create a similar kind of upset that you have been experiencing, because she might assume similar unintended meanings of disapproval by you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her religion is a large part of her life. My guess is that your atheism is a much smaller part of yours.  There is so much more to what you do with your life than not having a belief in gods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send her things that reflect your life and what is important to you. For instance, you said that ideally, you would like her to see that it is possible to be happy and complete without God or Jesus. Rather than sending her things to convince her of that, just demonstrate the happiness and completeness that is real for you.  I’m guessing that you don’t go out to try to be happy and complete specifically without God or Jesus, you just try to be happy and complete, period.  Share your successes in that way with her. Let her feel proud and happy for you.  Leave the theism and the atheism out of it entirely; it isn’t that relevant in this relationship, because there’s so much more to you than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have here the opportunity for a relationship with a person who loves you for a very primal reason. You seem to be able to accept her religiosity as simply a part of who and what she is.  Reframe her religious gifts and gestures to you, seeing them as expressions of love instead of disapproval of you, and then you can enjoy and return that love unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;

But while brood parasitism is easy on the parents, it isn&amp;#39;t so easy on their chicks, as a study recently published in PLoS ONE suggests.

.flickr-photo { }.flickr-frameright { float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width:40%;}.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; }

A reed warbler feeds a common cuckoo chick. Photo from WikiMedia Commons.A brood parasitic chick faces two challenges. The first is to avoid being recognized by its adoptive parents and ejected from the nest; the second is to win parental attention in competition with their adoptive nest-mates. The first challenge may be partially met by the evolution of eggshells that match host eggshells; and brood parasite parents may also help by keeping watch on the host nest so they can punsish hosts who eject introduced eggs. (This punishment behavior has been described as an &amp;quot;avian mafia [$-a].&amp;quot;)

In competition with their adoptive nest-mates, though, parasitic chicks are on their own. If the host&amp;#39;s own eggs hatch, the host has more mouths to feed and less time to spend on the parasitic chick. On the other hand, a brood parasitic mother can&amp;#39;t kick out the host&amp;#39;s eggs at the time she leaves her own egg with the host, because the host may abandon a nest that contains only a single unfamiliar-looking egg. This leaves it to freshly-hatched brood parasite chicks to do the heavy lifting involved in ejecting their host&amp;#39;s eggs themselves.

A common cuckoo chick pushes one of its host&amp;#39;s eggs out of the nest. Detail of figure 1 from Anderson et al. (2009).Egg eviction looks like hard work -- the chicks attempt it while they&amp;#39;re not much bigger than the eggs. Anderson et al. investigated the cost of all this adoptive-siblicidal effort by manipulating reed warbler nests that had been parasitized by common cuckoos,* taking away the hosts&amp;#39; eggs in experimental nests, and comparing the growth of cuckoo chicks in those nests to that of chicks in unmanipulated nests, who had to do the evicting themselves.

They found that there is a cost to eviction effort: during the period of development when they would be doing all they could to push eggs out of the nest, cuckoo chicks grew faster when they didn&amp;#39;t have eggs to push. But they didn&amp;#39;t grow much faster, and by the time they were ready to leave the nest, the advantage had disappeared. Anderson et al. take this to mean that the cost of eviction is &amp;quot;recoverable&amp;quot; through the benefits of increased parental attention later on. I would add that it points out how important your choice of time frame can be when investigating how traits or behaviors affect organisms&amp;#39; evolutionary fitness -- sometimes a cost paid at one point in development is an investment toward later benefits.

*The common cuckoo is the species first known to parasitize other birds&amp;#39; nests, and its name is the linguistic source of the term &amp;quot;cuckold.&amp;quot;

Jesus taught that we should be perfect as God is perfect. The early Christians argued that we should be holy as God is holy.  It is straightforward that we should look to God, and what He does, and mimic it as exactly as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Jesus further taught that we must love our enemies and forgive them.  Jesus wouldn’t command a moral that God doesn’t ascribe to, would he?  Give humans a higher calling, a greater duty than God Himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we are to love and forgive our enemies, why can’t God love and forgive His enemies?&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I am posting on a blog entitled “debunking Christianity” I thought it only fitting to figure out exactly what it is I am supposed to be debunking. What is this thing called “Christianity”?  As we all know, there is no set and steady definition, by which we can say with bright line precision –“this is Christian and this is not.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some claim following the Nicene Creed is necessary to be a Christians.  Some Protestants say Catholics are not “Christian.”  The Mormons continually are rejected “Christian” status by both Protestants and Catholics.  Christian Science adherents attempted to upstage everybody by putting it right in their name, yet still are assured by many camps they are truly not “Christian.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I even have seen atheists claim that, by certain definitions, they are “Christians.”  In reviewing all of these claims, the one base-line definition in which everyone seems to concur, is that it means to do the things that Christ taught.  If you aren’t doing that, then regardless of race, religion or creed, you are not being “Christian.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously the place to look, then, is at Christ’s teaching.  One of the stalwart principles, the very reason Christians claim the superiority of Jesus’ words, is the concept of Love.  And what does He say about that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“…love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you,…”  Matt. 5:44, Luke 6:27-28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus even points out that it is not to one’s credit to simply love those that love you.  Even the pagans and sinners can do that.  The identifying mark, the uniqueness of the Christian experience is the ability to love one’s enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.  And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. “  Luke 6:32-33&lt;br&gt;“For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?”  Matt. 5:46&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bible is replete with the claim that this type of demonstration of love is the defining characteristic of a person that is to be Christ-like.  A Christian.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.” John 13:35&lt;br&gt;“We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. The man who says, ‘I know him,’ but does not do what he commands is a liar and the truth is not in him.” 1 John 2:3-4&lt;br&gt;“And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. Those how obey his commands live in him, and he in them.” 1 John 3:23&lt;br&gt;“Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” 1 John 4:7-8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far, simple enough.  Jesus defines morality. Jesus tells us the moral code.  “Love your enemies.”  Having been informed by many theists that I am now an “enemy” of Jesus, I rest easy in the fact that He loves me, right?  Unfortunately, this moral code of “loving one’s enemy” does not apply to Jesus Himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of the Luke passage regarding love, Jesus states, “Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.” (Luke 6:36)  O.K.  How is God merciful?  He has mercy on whom he has mercy, and does not on those he does not.  (Rom. 9:15-18)  It would seem, that  in copying God’s morals on mercy, the Christian can be merciful as those they want to be merciful, and not on those they choose to not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of a sudden, I am not so certain I like this “Christ-likeness.”  It seems to have an ugly side to it.  Jesus says, that it is to human’s credit to love those that persecute them, but when it comes to God, “He will also say to those on the left hand, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink…” Matt. 25:41-42.  It would seem we have a double-standard.  Humans have to love those that persecute them.  God does not.  But if a human chooses to act like Christ, who was God, they are off the hook.  No more loving those that persecute them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are humans held to a higher standard than God, do you think?  We have to exhibit more love than He can!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Jesus said He is kind to the unthankful and evil, right?  Luke 6:35.  What does this kindness look like?  Take a trip in the time machine, back to Moses’ day.  Let’s observe the kindness Jesus shows to the unthankful and evil, shall we?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Numbers 31.  The Midianites.  “Kill every man, no matter what the age from 1 day to 100 years old. Kill every mother. Kill every widow. Keep all the virgin females to be your forced wives, as booty for the war.” I hope every moral barometer just blew off the charts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus is saying that the Hebrews, in exhibiting God’s love, had a right to kill and take virgins as wives (perhaps second or third wife at that).  This is kindness to evil?  (Assuming they even were evil)  I would hate to see unkindness!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But imagine Jesus. Use the artist’s imagery, or your own. Picture his face, his eyes, his mouth, his chin. Place him in Jewish clothing. Now put him at the scene of Numbers 31.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He looks to his right. There a woman is running from a soldier, clutching her 2-year old boy to her chest, attempting to get away. Another soldier pushes her to the ground. She covers her baby boy. Pagan, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, it doesn’t matter. A mother will protect her child. She doesn’t care about rituals, or religions, or war. She doesn’t even care about dying. Just that her child will live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The soldier thrusts his sword through her back into the boy. Killing a human outright is surprisingly difficult. Most would die from mortally inflicted wounds. The mother would pull away her son, who is screaming in pain and fear, and will watch him slowly die, while her own innards are sprayed upon his face. And Jesus watches this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a bad situation. Christians need to read their tales as they are written. Not pretty them up with flannel graphs and pictures of bloodless swords and string and glue. Before imposing their moral system on others, they should take a good long hard look at their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus looks to the left. A soldier has just killed a young man, and, expecting the same, his twelve-year old sister crouches next to the twitching body. The soldier shoves his bloody hand between the girl’s legs. (How do you think they determined who was a virgin or not?) His hand leaves a bloody mark. He pushes her over to a group of girls huddled and crying together. They have watched, and are watching their mothers, cousins and brothers die—screaming in pain. Her thighs slowly stick together with the coagulating blood of her brother. And Jesus looks on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus looks straight ahead. A group of soldiers is worn out from the killing. Both arms are covered in blood, as they have had to switch the sword from arm to arm, due to fatigue. They can hardly stand, due to the slippery blood. Waiting to recuperate, they gather in a circle around a few boys who are standing among their dead friends. Rather than wade in and kill them, while resting they wait. If a boy attempts to escape, the soldier would have to lift his weary arm and knock him down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What look do you imagine on Jesus’ face? Even assuming there was some bizarre moral necessity that warranted the love exhibited by the killing of baby boys (they are explicitly mentioned!) so that the men could take virgin females as wives, do you think Jesus would have compassion on this horrible situation? Let’s see what Jesus does, shall we? “Count up the plunder, and make sure I get my share.” (vs. 26-28) THAT is what “kindness to unthankful and evil” consists of.  THAT is what “being merciful as God is merciful” looks like.   Jesus is mercifully relieving the bodies of their Gold, and the fathers of their virgin daughters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is at this moment that I breathe a sign of relief.  Thank goodness Christians feel bound by what Jesus says!  Otherwise, I could see the thought process of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  God loves His enemies.&lt;br&gt;2.  God kills His enemies, takes their virgin daughters and their gold.&lt;br&gt;3.  I must love as God loves.&lt;br&gt;4.  You are my enemy.&lt;br&gt;5.  *shudder*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My only hope is that these few words (not Jesus’ actions) keep them in check!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can’t God forgive his enemies?  Shoot, I am not even &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to be an enemy of God.  The evidence is overwhelming He does not exist, let alone be his enemy.  We could equally say I am an enemy of Superman, or leprechauns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of my occupation, I am often informed (and was on my initial blog here) about how I will or will not be able to argue my case before Jesus on Judgment day.  This will certainly be an area that comes up:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I looked for you.  I searched history, philosophy, archeology, texts, articles, books, lectures, Sacred writings and even debated with any theist that would have me.  As you can clearly see, I did not find you.  I do not hate you (although some of your followers are pretty scary) I do not loathe you.  I assumed, since you did not exist, that humans blamed their desire for virgins and gold on you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But now that I am here, apparently you will consider me an enemy.  Then what was all that language about “loving your enemies”?  Does that not apply to you as well?  What about being merciful?  Was that simply a ruse?  The time on “debunkingchristianity”?  Is making your followers think qualify as “persecution”?  Then why create us with brains?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I see you are hell-bent on not forgiving, not loving, and imposing impossible standards on persons you consider your enemies.  Fine.  Just remember, that, as humans, we did a better job of loving than you can.  We can follow your morals better than you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people tell me they find Christianity compelling because of what Jesus said and did—I look to what Jesus said and did.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000568" title=""&gt;Circadian KaiC Phosphorylation: A Multi-Layer Network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Circadian clocks are endogenous timing mechanisms that allow living organisms to coordinate their activities with daily environmental fluctuations. In cyanobacteria, almost all the genes are rhythmically expressed with the same ~24 h period yet exhibit a variety of phase relationships and waveforms. Remarkably, the core pacemaker ticks robustly via simple biochemical reactions carried out by three Kai proteins: KaiC undergoes circadian phosphorylation in the presence of KaiA, KaiB and ATP. In this work, we propose a reaction network modeling the Kai oscillator based on the differentiation of dual phosphorylation sites. We found a dynamic diversity in KaiC phosphorylation which may serve as a potential regulatory mechanism related to the diverse-phased genome-wide expressions in cyanobacteria. In addition, we deduce that each KaiC hexamer is a single oscillator in regulating its own phosphorylation and interactions with KaiA or/and KaiB. In complex organisms, a number of key clock components possess similar activities (e.g., phosphorylation) with multiple nonequivalent active sites, and they may also show some unusual dynamic features that are embedded in the proteins' own reaction networks. We hope our work could be helpful to study the correlations between gene expressions and circadian rhythm in prokaryotic cells, even in eukaryotic cells.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000573" title=""&gt;Evaluation of the Oscillatory Interference Model of Grid Cell Firing through Analysis and Measured Period Variance of Some Biological Oscillators&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For many animals, including rats, accurate spatial memory over relatively large areas is important in order to find food and shelter. Just as unique points in time can be efficiently represented by combinations of repeating elements like hours, days, and months, points in space can be represented as combinations of elements that repeat at different spatial scales. Just such a code has been identified in the brains of rats and it shows an intriguing triangular spacing of encoded locations. Two different explanations have been developed as to what general mechanism in the brain might be able to generate this unusual code. However, to date there is not conclusive experimental evidence indicating whether either of the two explanations is correct. Here we show in detail that one of the explanations, called oscillatory interference, has specific requirements regarding the amount of variability in the system that implements it. We then report data experimentally examining candidate systems to evaluate their levels of noise. The large amount of noise that we find presents a challenge to the currently suggested biological implementations of oscillatory interference, but it does not provide support for the alternative explanation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000723" title=""&gt;10 Reasons to be Tantalized by the B73 Maize Genome&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should you read about the maize genome? Now that so many eukaryotic genomes are available, it's easy to be blasé... just another few billion bases, grist for constructing gene trees. Why is this new information, so recently shared, worth considering? I am convinced, as I propose you will be too as you read on, that both geneticists and genome consumers will benefit from the first description of the B73 maize genome [1] and equally so from the companion papers compiled in this special collection (http://collections.plos.org/plosgenetics​/maize.php ).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007943" title=""&gt;On Theoretical Models of Gene Expression Evolution with Random Genetic Drift and Natural Selection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relative contributions of natural selection and random genetic drift are a major source of debate in the study of gene expression evolution, which is hypothesized to serve as a bridge from molecular to phenotypic evolution. It has been suggested that the conflict between views is caused by the lack of a definite model of the neutral hypothesis, which can describe the long-run behavior of evolutionary change in mRNA abundance. Therefore previous studies have used inadequate analogies with the neutral prediction of other phenomena, such as amino acid or nucleotide sequence evolution, as the null hypothesis of their statistical inference. In this study, we introduced two novel theoretical models, one based on neutral drift and the other assuming natural selection, by focusing on a common property of the distribution of mRNA abundance among a variety of eukaryotic cells, which reflects the result of long-term evolution. Our results demonstrated that (1) our models can reproduce two independently found phenomena simultaneously: the time development of gene expression divergence and Zipf's law of the transcriptome; (2) cytological constraints can be explicitly formulated to describe long-term evolution; (3) the model assuming that natural selection optimized relative mRNA abundance was more consistent with previously published observations than the model of optimized absolute mRNA abundances. The models introduced in this study give a formulation of evolutionary change in the mRNA abundance of each gene as a stochastic process, on the basis of previously published observations. This model provides a foundation for interpreting observed data in studies of gene expression evolution, including identifying an adequate time scale for discriminating the effect of natural selection from that of random genetic drift of selectively neutral variations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007939" title=""&gt;Combination of Real-Value Smell and Metaphor Expression Aids Yeast Detection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Smell provides important information about the quality of food and drink. Most well-known for their expertise in wine tasting, sommeliers sniff out the aroma of wine and describe them using beautiful metaphors. In contrast, electronic noses, devices that mimic our olfactory recognition system, also detect smells using their sensors but describe them using electronic signals. These devices have been used to judge the freshness of food or detect the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. However, unlike information from gas chromatography, it is difficult to compare odour information collected by these devices because they are made for smelling specific smells and their data are relative intensities. Here, we demonstrate the use of an absolute-value description method using known smell metaphors, and early detection of yeast using the method. This technique may help distinguishing microbial-contamination of food products earlier, or improvement of the food-product qualities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007933" title=""&gt;Motor and Linguistic Linking of Space and Time in the Cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent literature documented the presence of spatial-temporal interactions in the human brain. The aim of the present study was to verify whether representation of past and future is also mapped onto spatial representations and whether the cerebellum may be a neural substrate for linking space and time in the linguistic domain. We asked whether processing of the tense of a verb is influenced by the space where response takes place and by the semantics of the verb. Responses to past tense were facilitated in the left space while responses to future tense were facilitated in the right space. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right cerebellum selectively slowed down responses to future tense of action verbs; rTMS of both cerebellar hemispheres decreased accuracy of responses to past tense in the left space and to future tense in the right space for non-verbs, and to future tense in the right space for state verbs. The results suggest that representation of past and future is mapped onto spatial formats and that motor action could represent the link between spatial and temporal dimensions. Right cerebellar, left motor brain networks could be part of the prospective brain, whose primary function is to use past experiences to anticipate future events. Both cerebellar hemispheres could play a role in establishing the grammatical rules for verb conjugation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007927" title=""&gt;Genome-Wide Scan for Signatures of Human Population Differentiation and Their Relationship with Natural Selection, Functional Pathways and Diseases&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genetic differences both between individuals and populations are studied for their evolutionary relevance and for their potential medical applications. Most of the genetic differentiation among populations are caused by random drift that should affect all loci across the genome in a similar manner. When a locus shows extraordinary high or low levels of population differentiation, this may be interpreted as evidence for natural selection. The most used measure of population differentiation was devised by Wright and is known as fixation index, or FST. We performed a genome-wide estimation of FST on about 4 millions of SNPs from HapMap project data. We demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of FST values between autosomes and heterochromosomes. When we compared the FST values obtained in this study with another evolutionary measure obtained by comparative interspecific approach, we found that genes under positive selection appeared to show low levels of population differentiation. We applied a gene set approach, widely used for microarray data analysis, to detect functional pathways under selection. We found that one pathway related to antigen processing and presentation showed low levels of FST, while several pathways related to cell signalling, growth and morphogenesis showed high FST values. Finally, we detected a signature of selection within genes associated with human complex diseases. These results can help to identify which process occurred during human evolution and adaptation to different environments. They also support the hypothesis that common diseases could have a genetic background shaped by human evolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007921" title=""&gt;A Mechanistic Niche Model for Measuring Species' Distributional Responses to Seasonal Temperature Gradients&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Niche theory is central to understanding how species respond geographically to climate change. It defines a species' realized niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potential niche--the fundamental niche in a given environment or geographic space. However, most predictions of the effects of climate change on species' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized niche, which assume that species are in distributional equilibrium with respect to the variables or gradients included in the model. Here, I present a mechanistic niche model that measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the physiology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize the model for bird species in North and South America and show that most focal bird species are not in direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most focal bird species possess broad thermal tolerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change. I conclude with discussion of how mechanistic niche models may be used to (i) gain insights into the processes that cause species to respond to climate change and (ii) build more accurate correlative distribution models in birds and other species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been studying quantum physics for a bit now and was hoping that Bob could give his explanation of The Uncertainty Principle and Wave/Particle duality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first question is…&lt;br&gt;
Is the drawing of a wave (on paper) just a 2D representation of a more abstract idea of what a wave really is? or can we literaly imagine a particle flying through space oscillating up and down along it’s amplitude.(quantum oscillation?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second question is how this relates to Photon slit experiments…&lt;br&gt;
Does the photon display the properties of a wave as it is flying towards the slit, and then display the properties of a particle when it hits the wall? IS this why we cannot predict where the photon will land? Because it is displaying the characteristics of a wave and therefore exist anywhere within the oscillating amplitude, even if all places at one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…If you please, I would like to hear Bob and the SGU’s understanding of Wave/Particle duality, The Uncertainty Principle, and Photon slit experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the question Dan, I’m no quantum physicist but I do play one on a podcast so I’ll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a little background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wave Particle Duality refers to the bizarre dual nature of light. Some consider this the central mystery of Quantum Mechanics. Light is not either a wave OR a particle but it is somehow a fusion of both. Some experiments show its wave nature and others its particle nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two classical examples of its wave nature are diffraction and interference. Only waves exhibit these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the photoelectric effect in which incident light knocks out electrons from matter is that iconic experiment which shows that light is also a particle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most interestingly, this dual nature extends to atoms and molecules and even to all macroscopic objects. So yes, you and I have a wavelength but they are so incredibly small that our wave properties aren’t seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan also mentions the Uncertaintly Principle in his question so I’ll give a little background on this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinsenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (also known as the Indeterminacy Principle), is the notion that since matter ultimitely has this spread-out wave-like nature, it is impossible to pin it down precisely at the quantum scale. There is then a fundamental limit to the extent we can examine nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, objects of study often consists of pairs of quantities like position and momentum, so-called conjugate variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heisenberg said we cannot know both of these quantities with arbitrary precision. The more we know one, the less clear the other becomes. If we know position with absolute precision, then there’s nothing we can know about its momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to stress that this limitation is not due to primitive technology or brain structure but is impossible IN PRINCIPLE. Think of any uber-advanced sci-fi aliens&lt;br&gt;
The Q&lt;br&gt;
Organians&lt;br&gt;
Krell&lt;br&gt;
pan-dimensional mice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them can investigate nature any deeper than allowed by this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite example of this limitations is weather prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, If we knew the precise locations and momenta of every particle in the atmosphere, we could extrapolate future interactions and therefore the weather deep into the future. Because we can’t in principle know this information, then any model we create is by definition an average with unavoidable round-off errors no matter how tiny. These errors double and double over time eventually overwhelming any attempt at detailed prediction past a handful of days. This same limitation applies to all chaotic systems in which there is this sensitive dependence on initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan’s first question is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is the drawing of a wave (on paper) just a 2D representation of a more abstract idea of what a wave really is? or can we literaly imagine a particle flying through space oscillating up and down along it’s amplitude.(quantum oscillation?)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we can internalize the dual nature of light enough to visualize it as it truly is. This may just be a fundamental limitation to how humans perceive the world and our intelligence. Like trying to teach a dog algebra. The smartest dog can’t hope to understand it.  Depending on the context of the visualization, I think you can legitimately visualize it in a number of ways. Each one is a valid way to visualize if it makes sense in the context. You can visualize it as a simple 2D wave and that would be sufficient for many applications. If you want to visualize it in 3 dimensions then imagine an oscillating magnetic field 90 degrees away from an electric field. Each field is creating the other letting it fly through even the vacuum of space, no ether required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="javascript:void(0);" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Light as it really is?" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wavepartice1.gif" alt="Light as it really is?" width="506" height="268"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="javascript:void(0);" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other obvious way you can visualize it is as discrete photon or packet of energy. If you just wamt to try to imagine it as it really is then my favorite compromise is a small tear-drop shape with a wave shape inside it. &lt;img src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan’s second question related this to the famous photon slit experiments…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Does the photon display the properties of a wave as it is flying towards the slit, and then display the properties of a particle when it hits the wall? IS this why we cannot predict where the photon will land? Because it is displaying the characteristics of a wave and therefore exist anywhere within the oscillating amplitude, even if all places at one?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This refers to one of the most famous experments of all time. Young’s Double-Slit experiment from the early 1800s. This clearly shows not only Duality in which light is somehow both particle and wave but also Complementarity in which only one aspect can be revealed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the experimental setup: Imagine light shining on a barrier with 2 slits in it allowing the light to shine through and onto a far wall. Light coming thru 2 slits creates 2 sources of light which then interact with each other like water waves creating an interference pattern of bright and dark spots instead of big and small waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really weird stuff happen when you shine light so dim that only one photon is traversing the slits at a time. Even in this case an interference pattern builds up. It seems then that the single photon of light is entering both slits at once and interfering with itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple experiment is pretty much the poster boy for Quantum Mechanics. In fact, physicist Richard Feynman famously said once that all of QM could be derived from the implications of this one experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="youngs_double-slit_experiment" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/youngs_double-slit_experiment.jpg" alt="youngs_double-slit_experiment" width="300" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan asks why we can’t predict where the photon will land. We cannot predict this because quantum phenomena are inherently unpredictable. They are for all intents and purposes a-causal events. The best we can do is assign probabilities as to where they will go. This inherently statistical nature of reality is what upset Einstein so much prompting his God Does Not Play Dice quote and removing him from cutting edge physics for the last decades of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that God does play D&amp;amp;D every chance he gets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258726827143"><id gr:original-id="http://www.layscience.net/node/801">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f320e1151886baf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Drink Spiking Myth Part 2</title><published>2009-11-20T08:26:46Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T08:26:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/pJLV99lpgTg/801" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/801"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">As promised, here&amp;#39;s the second part of my look at the myth of drink spiking. Last time, we saw that the idea that drink-spiking is a widespread problem is a myth, with the evidence showing that in fact in the vast majority of cases where people believe their drinks have been spiked, this simply isn&amp;#39;t the case - the symptoms they experience have been down to alcohol poisoning. In this post, we&amp;#39;ll look at the reasons why this myth has become so widespread, as discussed in Burgess et al&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Embodying Uncertainty?: Understanding Heightened Risk Perception of Drink &amp;#39;Spiking&amp;#39;&amp;quot; [1]. 

Their study found that those students showing a high degree of concern about drink spiking were almost exclusively female. To explain this, they propose a two-pronged explanation based on the hundreds of in-depth interviews they conducted:

&amp;quot;A need to explain feelings of vulnerability associated with ‘big nights’ may well impel young  female students to assimilate the discourse of drink-spiking awareness, whilst the desire to find a way of framing the masculine practice of binge-drinking in feminine terms may well make the same discourse particularly appealing.&amp;quot;

Their questioning of female university students revealed a great deal of anxiety about the drinking culture in universities, in particular the problem of being drunk while exposed to the &amp;#39;false intimacy&amp;#39; of events like Fresher parties, or &amp;#39;Flirt nights&amp;#39;.

In the UK interviews, female first-year students commonly saw nights out as risky affairs,

and often implied — although rarely conceded — that alcohol introduced an element of uncertainty into  an already difficult social situation. 

&amp;#39;Rarely conceded&amp;#39; is the key point, and in fact the interviews conducted showed what can only be described as denialism over drinking, as the following fascinating discussion describes:

Interviewee: I’m always quite precautionary,  ’ cos when you’re drunk you’ve got to be, you can’t ... you’ve always got to be aware of things. But I think there is always [the threat of drink-spiking] in the back of your mind now. And I don’t necessarily think that’s a  bad  thing, it just means you’re more cautious ... it’s a slight paranoia. I mean, I wouldn’t get paranoid to the extent that it ruins a night, but it’s a concern. Especially because I don’t really drink bottled drinks ... I mean, you don’t always want to carry [your drink] around everywhere but, really, that’s inevitable .... Like, before, in the Venue you could leave your drinks and go for a dance. But not so much now. I only leave [my drink] with friends, but even then … [hesitates]. 

Interviewer: You wouldn’t leave it with a friend? 

Interviewee: No, I do trust my friends, I don’t know why I said that... 

What is interesting about this conversation, beyond the student’s marked level of distrust, is that concern about alcohol is quickly elided by concern about drink-spiking. Alcohol makes it necessary to be cautious, this young woman suggests, but it is the more specific threat of DFSA — of a drink being spiked rather than the drink itself — that becomes the focus of attention. 

Whilst a few students give up drinking altogether, most continue to drink and increasing numbers drink heavily, and, for those in the last two categories — the drinking majority — alcohol is deemed to be less of a problem than drink-spiking. In fact, often, in US respondents’  accounts of suspected drink-spiking incidents, rhere was a distinctly defensive view negating the role of alcohol in producing the events or symptoms. This was accomplished either by identifying symptoms with a specific drink (n = 21) rather than ‘drinking’ or by including information about how little alcohol the victim had consumed (n = 12).

Interestingly, respondents apparently felt the need to address the contribution of alcohol in their stories, but this was often to deny its role. As the authors remark: &amp;quot;There appears to be widespread disbelief, or active denial, that excess alcohol could cause the same incoherence, physical distress and incapacity associated with  ‘date rape’ drugs.&amp;quot; 

Why the denialism? Because of the immense pressure students feel to drink. Indeed, respondents suggested that it was &amp;quot;almost impossible&amp;#39; not to drink, and described &amp;quot;unrelenting pressure&amp;quot;, as one response highlights:

&amp;quot;Before every night out there’s a drinking circle at the bar .... And last night I couldn’t go ... and this morning I had loads of text messages saying ‘where were you? It’s terrible, you’re a Fresher, you should be out’. Now I don’t drink  that  much, but it’s definitely seen as a bonding thing, like the Freshers should get to know the Seniors by going out and drinking .... There are a few people who don’t really drink in the club, and after a while they’ve been forced into doing it. Like I’ve been offered a drink, and when I said ‘No’ I’ve been given very funny looks... &amp;quot;

In other words, there is a deep conflict here. On the one hand, female students in particular describe feelings of vulnerability associated with nights out that involve heavy drinking; but on the other intense peer pressure prevents them from addressing the real cause of the problem. The authors suggest that &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Drink-spiking awareness&amp;#39; ... might perform just such a role.&amp;quot;

Before I conclude, it&amp;#39;s important to make clear that the mugging, assault or rape of an intoxicated individual is the responsibility of the mugger, attacker or rapist, and the state of their victim in no way absolves them of guilt. In fact in my opinion it makes the crime that much more cynical. Being drunk does not mean you should take the blame when somebody takes advantage of your state to commit a crime against you. 

However, we have to confront a culture in which young women and men are abusing alcohol to the extent that they are losing all control over their actions and their situation. Town centres on a Saturday night are like war zones, and it&amp;#39;s only thanks to heavy policing at a huge cost to taxpayers that the results of this aren&amp;#39;t even worse than they already are in terms of violence, medical problems, and sexual assault. 

Alcohol abuse in Britain and elsewhere is at epidemic proportions, and it&amp;#39;s something that we seem to be in deep denial about. When something goes wrong on a night out we&amp;#39;ll blame spiking, our mood, our friends, anything but the drink itself. The myth of the date rape drug is in many ways a construct of our cultural denial of the harm that alcohol is causing. In many ways, the same denial contributed to Professor Nutt&amp;#39;s sacking as he dared to question the idea that alcohol and tobacco are somehow more acceptable than drugs like cannabis or ecstacy.

Don&amp;#39;t tell us we&amp;#39;re drinking to much; we don&amp;#39;t want to hear it.

Rates are difficult to determine, as the behaviors are often concealed. One recent study tracked a group of 1400 Midwestern US high school students over a 5 year period (Muehlenkamp et al., 2009). Rates of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) over 2001-205 were as follows:Besides being associated with depression and eating disorders (especially among girls), the current psychiatric bible (DSM-IV-TR) includes self-injury as one of nine diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder:Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself.Other criteria of BPD include:A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving).Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).Although it&amp;#39;s considered a very serious personality disorder, the diagnostic label is a controversial one, coming under fire from feminists (Shaw &amp;amp; Proctor, 2005) and from some psychiatrists, like Dinah at Shrink Rap (see Over The Border Line).Why Do Cutters Have Reduced Pain Perception?An earlier study by Schmahl  et al. (2006) examined the Neural correlates of antinociception in borderline personality disorder during the administration of heat pain. Do borderline patients injure themselves to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;feel more normal&amp;quot;) OR to down-regulate the emotional components of pain? The results didn&amp;#39;t really answer this question, but the authors gave two options:Limbic deactivation has been found to correlate with the degree of coping in aversive situations in general. . . . Thus, in view of these findings, self-inflicted pain may function to normalize neural activity in specific brain regions involved in emotional and cognitive processing. Alternatively, repeated self-injury could lead to an adaptation of pain thresholds and pain processing reflected in the current findings of elevated pain thresholds and disturbed prefrontal and limbic pain processing.A new fMRI study by Kraus et al. (2009) took a different approach and compared BPD patients and controls who listened to standardized scripts of self-injurious behavior while in the scanner. The procedure was as follows:Script-driven imagery was utilized to deliberately evoke emotional distress. The segments were Neutral (a woman on a shopping trip), Trigger (the woman watching a dispute between a mother and her child), Cognitive and Emotional Reactions (think about similar situations with your own mother), Self-Injurious Behavior (a typical act is described, from preparation to cutting itself), and Relaxation (presumably including the SI-induced decrease in aversive inner tension in BPD).For the between-group comparisons, the imaging data weren&amp;#39;t particularly strong at revealing robust differences. The primary finding was reduced activity in left orbitofrontal cortex in the BPD patients during the Cognitive and Emotional Reaction phase, possibly reflecting dysregulation of emotional control. However, the most intriguing finding in my view was deactivation in mid-cingulate cortex during the Self-Injury script. Although the authors didn&amp;#39;t plot this result, the coordinates for the deactivation overlap with regions of the anterior cingulate involved in the affective components of pain (Rainville et al., 1997).What&amp;#39;s plotted below is the result of a coordinate-based meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature on pain perception using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method. Articles on physical pain were identified in the BrainMap database (see Hypnosis and Pain Control for details). Of relevance for our current purposes is this midsaggital slice showing strong activation across studies of pain perception in a region of the anterior cingulate cortex that showed deactivation in the BPD patients during the self-injury script (the precise focus is indicated by the blue crosshairs). Although very preliminary, this finding may suggest that imagining an act of self-injury may downregulate the affective component of pain in individuals with borderline personality disorder.As always, there are limitations with such a pilot study. The authors even list them at the outset:Fixed-effects analyses limit the ability to generalize from the study sample to the larger population of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD).Due to the study design, a single section of the script could not be repeatedly presented, thus possibly diminishing the effect size of our results.As no control script was used, it cannot be determined whether our findings are related to self-injurious behavior (SIB) per se or to BPD features in general.Nonetheless, Kraus et al. are continuing to expand on this work with fMRI studies that more closely mimic SIB than the present script design.References...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

In this post, we'll look at the reasons why this myth has become so widespread, as discussed in Burgess &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;"Embodying Uncertainty?: Understanding Heightened Risk Perception of Drink 'Spiking'"&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their study found that those students showing a high degree of concern about drink spiking were almost exclusively female. To explain this, they propose a two-pronged explanation based on the hundreds of in-depth interviews they conducted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A need to explain feelings of vulnerability associated with ‘big nights’ may well impel young  female students to assimilate the discourse of drink-spiking awareness, whilst the desire to find a way of framing the masculine practice of binge-drinking in feminine terms may well make the same discourse particularly appealing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their questioning of female university students revealed a great deal of anxiety about the drinking culture in universities, in particular the problem of being drunk while exposed to the 'false intimacy' of events like Fresher parties, or 'Flirt nights'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK interviews, female first-year students commonly saw nights out as risky affairs,&lt;br&gt;
and often implied — although rarely conceded — that alcohol introduced an element of uncertainty into  an already difficult social situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Rarely conceded' is the key point, and in fact the interviews conducted showed what can only be described as denialism over drinking, as the following fascinating discussion describes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m always quite precautionary,  ’ cos when you’re drunk you’ve got to be, you can’t ... you’ve always got to be aware of things. But I think there is always [the threat of drink-spiking] in the back of your mind now. And I don’t necessarily think that’s a  bad  thing, it just means you’re more cautious ... it’s a slight paranoia. I mean, I wouldn’t get paranoid to the extent that it ruins a night, but it’s a concern. Especially because I don’t really drink bottled drinks ... I mean, you don’t always want to carry [your drink] around everywhere but, really, that’s inevitable .... Like, before, in the Venue you could leave your drinks and go for a dance. But not so much now. I only leave [my drink] with friends, but even then … [hesitates]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; You wouldn’t leave it with a friend? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I do trust my friends, I don’t know why I said that... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting about this conversation, beyond the student’s marked level of distrust, is that concern about alcohol is quickly elided by concern about drink-spiking. Alcohol makes it necessary to be cautious, this young woman suggests, but it is the more specific threat of DFSA — of a drink being spiked rather than the drink itself — that becomes the focus of attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst a few students give up drinking altogether, most continue to drink and increasing numbers drink heavily, and, for those in the last two categories — the drinking majority — alcohol is deemed to be less of a problem than drink-spiking. In fact, often, in US respondents’  accounts of suspected drink-spiking incidents, rhere was a distinctly defensive view negating the role of alcohol in producing the events or symptoms. This was accomplished either by identifying symptoms with a specific drink (n = 21) rather than ‘drinking’ or by including information about how little alcohol the victim had consumed (n = 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, respondents apparently felt the need to address the contribution of alcohol in their stories, but this was often to deny its role. As the authors remark: &lt;em&gt;"There appears to be widespread disbelief, or active denial, that excess alcohol could cause the same incoherence, physical distress and incapacity associated with  ‘date rape’ drugs." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the denialism? Because of the immense pressure students feel to drink. Indeed, respondents suggested that it was "almost impossible' not to drink, and described "unrelenting pressure", as one response highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before every night out there’s a drinking circle at the bar .... And last night I couldn’t go ... and this morning I had loads of text messages saying ‘where were you? It’s terrible, you’re a Fresher, you should be out’. Now I don’t drink  that  much, but it’s definitely seen as a bonding thing, like the Freshers should get to know the Seniors by going out and drinking .... There are a few people who don’t really drink in the club, and after a while they’ve been forced into doing it. Like I’ve been offered a drink, and when I said ‘No’ I’ve been given very funny looks... "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is a deep conflict here. On the one hand, female students in particular describe feelings of vulnerability associated with nights out that involve heavy drinking; but on the other intense peer pressure prevents them from addressing the real cause of the problem. The authors suggest that &lt;em&gt;"'Drink-spiking awareness' ... might perform just such a role."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I conclude, it's important to make clear that the mugging, assault or rape of an intoxicated individual is the responsibility of the mugger, attacker or rapist, and the state of their victim in no way absolves them of guilt. In fact in my opinion it makes the crime that much more cynical. Being drunk does not mean you should take the blame when somebody takes advantage of your state to commit a crime against you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we have to confront a culture in which young women and men are abusing alcohol to the extent that they are losing all control over their actions and their situation. Town centres on a Saturday night are like war zones, and it's only thanks to heavy policing at a huge cost to taxpayers that the results of this aren't even worse than they already are in terms of violence, medical problems, and sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol abuse in Britain and elsewhere is at epidemic proportions, and it's something that we seem to be in deep denial about. When something goes wrong on a night out we'll blame spiking, our mood, our friends, anything but the drink itself. The myth of the date rape drug is in many ways a construct of our cultural denial of the harm that alcohol is causing. In many ways, the same denial contributed to Professor Nutt's sacking as he dared to question the idea that alcohol and tobacco are somehow more acceptable than drugs like cannabis or ecstacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't tell us we're drinking to much; we don't want to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello dearest internet nutters and demi-gods alike,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you missed me? I'm sure you're bored of me apologising for not being able to blog daily, even my Twitter feed has been running a bit dry as of late, so I'll just crack on with the meaty post, shall I? (Incidentally, vegetarianism is doing well, euphemisms shall continue as normal... normal for me anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post has been brought to you today by the number 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 is the number of points I shall be making, and point 4 happens to be the most important point in this post - there's actually little point in reading all this, you may as well skip to the end. But for all you love starved, insignificant, and lonely souls out there, you may take solace in the three points leading up to the incredible, mysterious, and downright genius that we have lovingly come to know as 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I have been asked several times over the last few weeks by several of my single friends can be translated thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can I get the object of my affections to go out with me?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent question, one that has plagued mankind since we humans invented the morals that god gave us. Back in the olden days, when the Bible was being written, a man could just rape a woman and he owned her. Not so in these enlightened times. Now men and woman have to be clever about it. This is where my &lt;span&gt;single friends think&lt;/span&gt; I come in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Get their attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to consider is why the hell would they want anything to do with you - you who chooses to read dating tips ON THE INTERNET? It's likely that they have some level of intelligence, are probably at least moderately attractive, maybe even a joy to be around? Yeah, sure, they might not be perfect, but they'd be perfect for you if only they gave you a chance...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure that out, maybe get 4 or 5 personal qualities that could be spun favourably to put you in a good light. Do something that catches their eye, turns their head a bit. If you can't think of anything, then do us all a favour and just give up. Alternatively, ask a few friends about your good qualities. If they're nice, they'll have loads to say but if they're really good friends, maybe ask a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Flirt outrageously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see you've carried on reading... Great. You have potential. Now you have to turn on the charm a bit and flirt with them. This is easy, you can find loads of tips on flirting. Pretty much: Women, play with your hair. Men, listen to what she's talking about and respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Start a fake bidding war&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite. You're basically going back on all the flirting effort you've put in to make them work a bit for your attention. It is important to maintain a minimal level of contact. Just enough to keep them interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to ask a friend to help you out here. They can be the fake bidder, the object of your affections is the real bidder, and you, my sumptuous bundle of manipulative love, are the prize. You and your fake bidder will only need to flirt when you know that  the &lt;span&gt;person you are imagining spending the rest of your life with&lt;/span&gt; real bidder is watching. This should drive the stakes up, and it can possibly lead to them flirting even more outrageously for your affections than you had ever considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The most important point, so important in fact, that I had to white it out for your own protection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASK THEM OUT YOU NUMBNUT!&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;-- Answer concealed within the apparently empty space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An extraordinary game of geo-strategy is under way to lock in long-term agreements, notably in the energy sector. At a global level, the transit routes of future oil &amp;amp; gas pipelines become the object of a power struggle involving not only the suppliers and end-users but also the transit countries. Intensive courtships are under way where a ménage à trois, or more, may be the best option to prevent any country from being in a dominating position to rule a region and exercise political or economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a practical example and look at some of the dynamics behind the Nabucco pipeline and at the different interests involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nabucco and the competing projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabucco is a 3,300 km natural gas pipeline going East to West, with a capacity of 31 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year that would reduce Europe’s dependency on gas supplied by Russia. It will go from Turkey to Austria via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. That project would be in direct competition with the Russian-endorsed South Stream pipeline, with a capacity of 63 bcm per year, that would start from Russia and end in Austria but with two prongs: one via Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, and one via Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia. Nabucco’s estimated cost is about  €8 billion with a completion date of 2014 while south Stream’s estimated cost is from  €19 to €24 billion with a completion date of 2015. South Stream was launched in 2007 when Russia’s President Dmitry Medvedev was then Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gazprom, Russia's largest company and the world's largest gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nabucco and the supplier countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formidable battles have been taking place between the Nabucco and South Stream backers to sign supply agreements, not only to guarantee that the much needed gas will be made available - as underutilizing the pipelines is not a viable option - but also to secure a political and financial will for the projects. Gazprom is engaged in a battle to preempt gas supplies and to keep European countries from what it considers as a Russian natural chasse guardée such as Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, though both countries have pledged to supply Nabucco as they understand their vulnerability by not having several export routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courtship is ongoing and in October 2009, Alexey Miller, Chairman of Gazprom, personally went to Baku, Azerbaijan to sign a long-term natural gas purchase and sale contract with the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). Following the signature, Miller made a statement, which gives a good insight on what is at stake: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;”Russia and Azerbaijan have a common border and have already been connected by the unified infrastructure. This enabled Gazprom to propose the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic the most attractive commercial terms and conditions of gas purchase. Our partnership is logically consistent and fully meets our mutual interests. I am confident that in the coming years the volume of Azerbaijani gas supplied to Russia will increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement and contract are interesting because the agreement provides for a supply of 500 million cubic meters starting in January 2010, with potential increases depending on Azerbaijan’s export potential. This comes at a time when Gazprom has interrupted its deliveries of gas from Turkmenistan since April 2009, arguing a lesser demand from Europe. A few days after being in Azerbaijan, Miller was meeting with the President of Turkmenistan but no decision was reached regarding resumption of gas imports from Turkmenistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is holding whom by the tail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics around Nabucco when looked at closely highlights a web of sweet deals corresponding to a complex reality of entangled needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has very aggressively pursued locked-in supply agreements for extensive periods of time. The initial idea is that getting a deal in first could work towards keeping other players out. That approach did not end up creating exclusive relationships as countries such Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan appear to have enough supplies to satisfy multiple parties. Pricing agreements were also locked in for specified periods of time but the tumble in world energy prices put Gazprom in a dire situation: Gazprom is reported to have been paying $375.50 per thousand cubic meters (tcm) for Turkmen gas while only paying $217/tcm for Kazakhstani gas and $210/tcm for Uzbek gas. An “unfortunate” explosion in April 2009 that the Turkmens blame on Russia hit the pipeline connecting the two countries and deliveries have stopped. Gazprom stated it had not intention to resume purchasing Turkmen gas in 2009. Turkmenistan is said to be losing $1 billion/month over this issue. With Turkmenistan, Gazprom has a 25-year sale and purchase agreement Turkmenneftegaz signed in 2003. Prices were locked below world market prices, at less than half the price Europe was paying for its gas.  Subsequent price increases were negotiated but in exchange for the promise of higher delivery volumes with 60 bcm of gas in 2007, 60-70 bcm in 2008 and subsequently export up to 80 bcm annually through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say that Turkmenistan’s announcement in July 2009 of its willingness to provide gas to Nabucco does not come as a surprise in this context. Similarly the completion in October 2009 of $400 million 188-km section in Turkmenistan of a 7,000 km natural gas pipeline that will reach China is an important step towards diversification. The Turkmen government stated: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting gas supplies to China will mark another important milestone in the successful implementation of Turkmenistan's strategy of diversifying energy export routes to world markets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkmenistan has been assiduously courted because of it immense gas reserves. In 2008 the oil advisory firm Gaffney Cline &amp;amp; Associates (GCA) conducted a study on the South Yolotan-Osman field and determined that that field alone was the fifth largest in the world, with an estimated 4 trillion to 14 trillion cubic meters of gas. That good new was tampered in October 2009 when reports surfaced that GCA may have been misled (see article: “&lt;a href="http://www.oilprice.com/article-turkmen-gas-caveat-emptor.html"&gt;Turmen Gas – Caveat Emptor&lt;/a&gt;”). In any event, the potential of Turkmenistan should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nabucco and the transit countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Eastern European countries have been turning their back to Russia and have joined the European Union, espousing the EU’s energy security objectives to reduce its dependency on Russia gas.  The January 2009 showdown between Russia and Ukraine, which resulted on the gas supply to be cut to most of Europe in the midst of winter, could only serve as a wake-up call for the need to diversify energy routes. Bulgaria - which has the ambition to become an international gas hub and that is a party to both the Nabucco and South Stream projects - will benefit from that situation, notably by increasing its bargaining position to negotiate better energy agreements with Russia. It could, among other things, threaten to raise transit fees. Ukraine is using this threat against Russia and in September 2009, Gazprom expected Ukraine to increase gas transit fees by up to 58% in 2010. The stakes are high as transit fees represent a bonanza. While visiting Bulgaria in 2007, Vladimir Putin estimated that Bulgaria could earn up to $2.5 billion per year in transit fees alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Russia: just another shrewd player but…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may think that Russia pockets the difference from rates below market prices, but the reality is that Russia uses the discounted gas for its own domestic needs. It also has been using it to supply Ukraine under very favorable terms, and Ukraine has been very vocal in resisting Russia’s attempts to raise prices. Note must be made that Ukraine imports the bulk of its natural gas from Turkmenistan via Russia. Countries like Russia and Ukraine have been resisting passing on price increases to end-users to avoid social unrest and have been struggling to keep non-competitive industries afloat. One way of doing so is by keeping the cost of energy low. The adverse effect is that Ukraine is one of the most energy inefficient countries in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A point must be made that Russia should not just be perceived as a natural bully but more as a wounded bear. Russia, like any country, is looking after its own interests and is not always subtle about it, even more so as it feels that everyone is ganging against her, rightfully or not. Russia is also confronted with its own economic reality, most notably the over reliance of its economy and state budget on oil &amp;amp; gas revenues. Efforts to diversify the economy have failed to generate visible results. It is therefore essential for Russia to secure a guaranteed income flow from the sale of it oil and gas, and from the oil and gas of its neighbors, that it buys to resale at a profit or that it routes through its extensive pipeline network for a fee. But things change: sourcing oil and gas from or routing it via Russia is no longer the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...a new transportation mode is emerging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the gas pipeline battles are under way, a new trend is emerging which is the transition towards Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). That transportation mode of natural gas through seaborne tankers will open new markets, alleviate the dependency of some countries on existing pipeline routes, and reduce the number of players able to impact proper delivery and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standard cases of Gricean implicature is the interpretation of irrelevant praise. Thus in "Logic and Conversation", &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hQCzOmaGeVYC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA129"&gt;Grice's first example of "flouting the first maxim of quantity"&lt;/a&gt; is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: "Dear Sir, Mr X's command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc."  (Gloss: A cannot be opting out, since if he wished to be uncooperative, why write at all? he cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the man is his pupil; moreover, he knows that more information than this is wanted. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information that he is reluctant to write down. This supposition is tenable only on the assumption that he thinks Mr X is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is implicating.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Sally's praise, though perhaps excessive, is not irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a real-world rhetorical strategy that you sometimes see in reviews and evaluations: a set of very damaging criticisms are preceded by a roughly equal amount of strong praise.  In some cases, I think, the role of the praise is not so much to give an even-handed evaluation, as to strengthen the criticism by establishing that the writer or speaker is not prejudiced, sees the individual's good points, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In the world of this comic, however, Sally is just trying to be fair to people she genuinely (if fictionally) can't stand.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258721946337"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-4626184152969830124">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/344a1c0d63b31e11</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">124th Skeptic's Circle!</title><published>2009-11-20T12:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T12:06:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/11/124th-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">That's right, for your brain's enjoyment, the 124th Skeptic's Circle is up over at &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com/2009/11/20/the-124th-meeting-of-the-skeptics-circle/"&gt;Beyond the Short Coat&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear Dr. Isis,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you seen the Lady Gaga "Bad Romance" video?  I cannot get this song out of my head and thought I might suggest it to Your Hot Scientistness. I have a job interview coming up, and between planning my tastefully conservative ensembles and my clear, concise, and clever job talk, I am watching this video over and over.   I wish instead that I could be standing there in the seminar room in a dress trailing a polar bear with the whiteboard behind me on fire.  How can I channel some of that fierceness in a way that will result in a job offer and not an arrest record?  As an expert in hot science, you must have ways to bring out the goddess while nervous and sleep-deprived.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your humble admirer,&lt;br&gt;
Sign me&lt;br&gt;
"a biologist"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh, I have seen it and it is ferosh.  Good luck with the interview!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many times have we heard, “just give it some time, he/she will catch up”; or “there is not enough of a discrepancy between potential and achievement, so they won’t qualify for anything”; or how about this one, “we don’t really do anything until third grade, then we will begin to intervene”. Huh?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a paradigm shift happening in education, and we all need to get on board. It is not enough to wait until our students “catch-up” with their peers. We do not want to wait until failure is the only option. In fact, just the opposite is the ideal. As was mentioned in an earlier post, the best policy is to screen early and intervene when necessary, as soon as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movement that addresses this issue is entitled “Response to Intervention” or RtI.

The basic premise behind RtI is simple. Students are given a basic screening early in the school year, to identify strengths and weaknesses. This allows school-based teams to craft an approach to address the issues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to stay away from that — and it’s always nice reading comments by atheists on this site that show religious people some kindness and empathy — but no doubt it seeps in from time to time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greta Christina&lt;/strong&gt; believes that when religious people visit atheist websites (or read skeptical magazines or atheist books), they are making their first steps toward atheism whether they know it or not.  And &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2009/11/their-first-steps-atheism-patience-2.html"&gt;we ought to help them with that journey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… They’re proto-atheists. Any formerly-religious atheist knows that these kinds of doubts and questions and investigations are the first cracks in the foundation of faith. These folks — some of them, anyway, maybe a lot of them — are taking their first steps to atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for atheists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it means we have to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience doesn’t mean letting ourselves be kicked around. What it means is remembering that we’re talking to human beings, and treating them as such. It means being rigorously careful about critiquing ideas and beliefs without insulting people… It means remembering that it’s not fair to treat people like they’re stupid just because they’re not familiar with the ideas we’re so intimately familiar with. It means keeping in mind how hard it can be to let go of religion. It means remembering that we’re asking people to abandon a form of comfort they’ve relied on for years… and are asking them to make themselves into one of the most hated groups in the world, and quite possibly to alienate their family and friends, while they’re at it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, treating religious people (and their beliefs) with anything but spite is unbelievably difficult.  But it’s necessary if we want to persuade anyone to consider our views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greta wrote that after reading &lt;a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/2009/11/jehovahs-witnesses-hate-the-smurfs.html"&gt;a posting by &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Braasch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Daylight Atheism — Both pieces are great reads and well worth a few minutes of your time.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello dearest internet nutters and demi-gods alike,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you missed me? I'm sure you're bored of me apologising for not being able to blog daily, even my Twitter feed has been running a bit dry as of late, so I'll just crack on with the meaty post, shall I? (Incidentally, vegetarianism is doing well, euphemisms shall continue as normal... normal for me anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post has been brought to you today by the number 4.&lt;/p&gt;

An extraordinary game of geo-strategy is under way to lock in long-term agreements, notably in the energy sector. At a global level, the transit routes of future oil &amp;amp; gas pipelines become the object of a power struggle involving not only the suppliers and end-users but also the transit countries. Intensive courtships are under way where a ménage à trois, or more, may be the best option to prevent any country from being in a dominating position to rule a region and exercise political or economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

Case in point.  I have been slogging away at this entry for the last week and had the final draft up and ready to go, only to find this morning that the Health Care Reform bill no longer carries the language that was the crux of this entire post.  So what is a poor, slow, SBM writer to do? Chuck the whole thing?  Repost my 12 reasons you are a dumb ass not to get the flu vaccine yet again? Leave a hole in the SBM line up? No.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lets pretend we are in a parallel universe, perhaps an evil universe  where I have a goatee, and the language was not removed from the bill. Lets all pretend that this post is still relevant. Since the Christian Science Church has indicated they will try to get the bill amended to reinstate payment for their services, this post may be relevant again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or you could go read  Respectful Insolence instead. Don’t say you were not warned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ongoing themes of the H1N1 wackaloons is the concept that the current pandemic is not a natural phenomena but a Frankenstein’s monster, pieces of virus unnaturally stitched together in a government lab to be let loose upon the world village to kill and maim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule I have little sympathy or understanding for the conspiratorial world outlook.  It strikes me as ludicrous at best and insane at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would the government want to make a new vaccine and let it loose on the world? Some say to decrease the population to ameliorate global warming. Some say to cause panic and increase the use of vaccines and antivirals, a bailout for the pharmaceutical industry.  Others say it is to decrease health care costs.  I say, of course, it is primarily to decrease human death and suffering, but I am under the big pharma &lt;a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse"&gt;Imperius curse&lt;/a&gt;, so I would say that, wouldn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of the medical industrial complex is spiraling (does it really spiral? One definition of spiral is a “continuously accelerating change” but that is not what I think of when I think spiral. A corkscrew spirals. But I digress) out of control and expenditures on health care only increase (not, by the way, in a manner that ends up in my wallet.  I wonder just who is getting all that cash. Sure as hell hasn’t been me. I digress again; my overlords have advised me to stay on topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is spending all these health care dollars? The elderly and the chronically ill, particularly during the last year of life. What better way to cut medical costs than to send an influenza pandemic into the world to thin the herd. Of course, the current H1N1 has a predilection for killing the healthy, but the government has never been known for its competence. To judge the conspirators of the pandemic by their work, I would say they are not up to Dr. Evil level evil. It is impossible to take the conspiracy wackaloons seriously as their statements seem totally divorced from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought. Now I am not so sure.  The reason for the change of heart? The LA times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Backed by some of the most powerful members of the Senate, a little-noticed provision in the healthcare overhaul bill would require insurers to consider covering Christian Science prayer treatments as medical expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision was inserted by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) with the support of Democratic Sens. John F. Kerry and the late Edward M. Kennedy, both of Massachusetts, home to the headquarters of the Church of Christ, Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure would put Christian Science prayer treatments — which substitute for or supplement medical treatments– on the same footing as clinical medicine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way.  What does the real Senate bill say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(D) The essential benefits provided for in subparagraph (A) shall include a requirement that there be non-discrimination in health care in a manner that, with respect to an individual who is eligible for medical or surgical care under a qualified health plan offered through a Gateway, prohibits the Administrator of the Gateway, or a qualified health plan offered through the Gateway, from denying such individual benefits for religious or spiritual health care, except that such religious or spiritual health care shall be an expense eligible for deduction as a medical care expense as determined by Internal Revenue Service Rulings interpreting section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as of January 1, 2009.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House bill has similar wording:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Section 125. PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES BASED ON RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL CONTENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Commissioner nor any health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage through the Exchange shall discriminate in approving or covering a health care service on the basis of its religious or spiritual content if expenditures for such a health care service are allowable as a deduction under 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on January 1, 2009.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sponsor of the bill, Senator Harken, has said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is time to end the discrimination against alternative health care practices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is about giving people the pragmatic alternatives they want, while ending discrimination against practitioners of scientifically based alternative health care. It is about improving health care outcomes. And, yes, it is about reducing health care costs. Generally speaking, alternative therapies are less expensive and less intrusive – and we need to take advantage of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked at this. But then I considered.  Sen. Harken is interested in ’scientifically based alternative health care’ and science is in the title of Christian Science. So it makes some sense. And he is trying to reduce costs by encouraging medical therapies that are not effective.  Something smells fishy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would the government want to make sure prayer could be reimbursed as form of medical intervention? Surely our elected representative would not pander to their constituents? That would be beyond the pale.  There must be a deeper, more sinister, reason.  And I remember: dead people cost no money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Science was, like many of the topics discussed on this blog, invented. In this case it was Mary Baker Eddy, who,  in 1866, published the &lt;em&gt;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&lt;/em&gt;, the guiding document of Christian Science.  Their approach to all illness and injury is prayer.  To quote the ever helpful wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Christian Scientists believe that sickness is the result of fear, ignorance, or sin, and that when the erroneous belief is corrected, the sickness will disappear. They state that the way to eliminate the false beliefs is to replace them with true understanding of God’s goodness. They consider that suffering can occur only when one believes (consciously or unconsciously) in the supposed reality of a problem. If one changes one’s understanding, the belief is revealed as false, and the acknowledgment that the sickness has no power, as God is the only power, eliminates the sickness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of Christian Scientology, er, no, it must be Christian Scientist therapies has well documented effects upon the Christian Science population. And those effects are not beneficial to anyone who is not a mortician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in 1989 &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/262/12/1657"&gt;JAMA &lt;/a&gt; published a cohort study (Yes, I know from the last post that cohort studies prove nothing nothing nothing, but I am uncertain how one would apply Christian Science in a randomized, placebo controled, double blinded manner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at outcomes in 5,500 Christian Scientists and compared them to a group of almost 30,000 controls using conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each age group from 1934 to 1983, there was a greater death rate in the Christian Scientists when compared to the control population, a difference made more remarkable as Christian Scientists neither smoke nor drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JAMA study confirmed an earlier study from 1965 that demonstrated the death rate from cancer among Christian Scientists from was double the national average, and 6 percent died from preventable causes. Not being a Christian Scientists gave an average of more four years  of life to women and two more years of life to men (Wilson GE. Christian Science and longevity. J Forensic Sci. 1965;1:43-60).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00015022.htm"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; did a study where they compared a similar cohort of Christian Scientists to 7th Day Adventists and again found a decrease in longevity for all age groups of Christian Scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, those studies looked at the life expectancy of adults.  Christian Science children do not get vaccines and as a result, get diseases like measles and as a result, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;people die&lt;/a&gt; . Of measles.  That is so 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children of Christian Scientists occasionally die of &lt;a href="http://www.childrenshealthcare.org/victims.htm"&gt;diabetes and trauma&lt;/a&gt; that could otherwise have been treated or cured. Christian Science is not a healthy lifestyle and demonstrably shortens life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why would our Senate give incentives to people to seek prayer for their diseases?  As I said, I cannot imagine a politician deliberately pandering to voters endorsing a useless intervention that demonstrably kills and maims. Unless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a reason.  And the only reason I can think of is that the conspiracy wackaloons are right.  The government is out to get us.  Costs are going up in health care and the best way to save money is to encourage people into worthless treatments that will lead to their early deaths.  That is the surest way to keep health care costs down.  So it makes sense for the government to encourage people to use alternative medicine and pay for Christian Science.  Worthless therapies offer far more promise to thin the herd than the H1N1 pandemic or HIV.  And they sponsors look like they are being good guys in the process.  It is absolutely diabolical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, in its occasionally schizophrenic approach, is also funding &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/cer/"&gt;comparative effectiveness research &lt;/a&gt;as away of improving care and decreasing costs by demonstrating &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0904133"&gt;what works&lt;/a&gt;. Given the current track record of alternative therapies, if comparative effectiveness research bears any fruit, it will probably be the death knell for alternative therapies.  In the end alternative therapies will not have a prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have shaved my goatee.  We are returned to the previous time continuum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s just like rolling a die 600 times, and then getting excited about getting roughly 100 sixes. However, sometimes it’s much more subtle than just rolling dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem seems to be an issue in a recent by paper with the title ‘&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6VHB-4W9XBJW-2&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_searchStrId=1086223920&amp;amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=5b99e19646279ec51168d0a696c119f5"&gt;Evidence for solar forcing in variability of temperatures and pressures in Europe&lt;/a&gt;‘ by Le Mouel et al. (2009) in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a range of different so-called ’solar proxies’ (describing the state of the sun – in this case &lt;em&gt;monthly sunspot number, the aa-index, as well as the vertical Z and horizontal H component of the magnetic field measured at Eskdalemuir&lt;/em&gt;) is examined and compared with some climate indices – some rather obscure quantities that were assumed to represent the state of European climate, namely ‘mean-squared interannual temperature variations’ (MSITV) and ‘lifetime’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the similarity between the solar proxies and the climate indices were tested for different seasons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Le Mouel study found a ‘decent match’ only for one solar proxy and only in winter: the vertical Z component from Eskdalemuir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the paper was not clear on this, it appeared that a number of estimates for MSITV and ‘lifetime’ were explored using different lengths of time intervals (sliding ‘window size’) and for different seasons. In other words, by searching for one particular choice that gives the best match for one solar proxy, they may have ended up (unintentionally) ‘cherry picking’ the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were furthermore substantial differences between the solar proxy and lifetimes of T(2m), SLP, and wind direction before 1940 – and the paper forgot to even point this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a break-down of correlation outside a limited interval is typical of a fortuitous match – there is plenty of examples through science history of similar alleged links between solar activity and climate that eventually turned out not to hold up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mismatch before 1940 further points to my suspicion of a problem of multiplicity. The paper also neglects to discuss the statistical significance levels associated with the analysis – hence the validity of these conclusions is at best an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another weakness is that the paper offers little discussion on how the solar activity may affect local/regional temperature/pressure. E.g. how does &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; affect the wind directions and the ‘lifetime’, and why is there a strong dependency of the ’signal’ on the season? What is the hypothised physical link? As long as there is no hypothetical mechanism, there is no way of confirming whether the interpretations are correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to note that the time evolution of the &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; components of the magnetic field shows no clear trend over the period 1920-2000, and if anything, it seems as if there are opposite trends in &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; (these proxies have the highest correlations with the climate indices). Thus, it would be difficult to generalize these results to explain the past global mean temperature trends – as it is to make deductions for the global mean from a regional set of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also contains a number of sweeping statements &lt;em&gt;(e.g. the alleged strong evidence of the influence of solar variabilty on time scales as long as 100.000.000 years!)&lt;/em&gt; based on a dubious selection of citations that could be debated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  use of the MSITV and lifetime is interesting – why not just look at the temperature, precipitation and sea level air pressure? Had there been a ’solar signal’ in these, I’d expect those aspects would be discussed, rather than these unusual derivates. It’s therefore interesting to note that the LeMouel paper, on the one hand, demonstrates that there essentially is no relationship between several indicators for European climate and the aa-index or the monthly sunspot number, and on the other, argues in the introduction and discussion that these are important for the state of our climate…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258708556964"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/HvEPkbtFwX0/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89e7a92a3588d65b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Windshield splatter analysis…</title><published>2009-11-20T03:00:43Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T03:00:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/kUQ8Z1ll4g8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MentalIndigestion/~3/HvEPkbtFwX0/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A few years ago I took part in an RSPB survey called the Big Bug Count, which sought to quantitate what had hitherto been anecdotal accounts that the number of insect splats on car windscreens had decreased in recent years.

We don&amp;#39;t like to think that we are not fully in control of our own decisions, but we do like the thought that there is some additional hidden computing power behind the choices we make.

That information does not need to become conscious to affect our behavior is experimentally substantiated and popularly accepted. For example, a recent study involved the amount of effort people put into a task depending on the size of a reward they might win for completing the task. The study&amp;#39;s results show that people give greater effort if the potential reward is larger, even if the size of the award is only presented subliminally; something we might expect.

An interesting question that arises with these studies, is whether the subconsciously held information is employed simply as an indiscriminate motivation trigger, or whether there is some strategic application involved in how the subliminal information is used. In a way, the question is how smartly we are able to apply subconsciously held information to a situation.

A clever study, investigating exactly this question was this month published in the American Psychological Association&amp;#39;s journal Psychological Science.

The study, just as the one already mentioned above, involved the analysis of people&amp;#39;s efforts in an incentivized number-retention task, in which participants were asked to remember either 3 or 5 digits for a certain period of time. They were then awarded some monetary prize for correctly recalling the memorized numbers. To measure the mental effort, that participant&amp;#39;s put into the task, the study&amp;#39;s authors, Erik Bijleveld, Ruud Custers, and Henk Aarts, looked at how widely a participant&amp;#39;s pupils dilated during the number-retention task. This method of relating pupil dilation to effort, relies on our physiological understanding of how pupils respond to effort when controlling for other influences on sympathetic activity; possibly material for a different blog post. 

The crucial hypothesis behind this experiment rests on the assumption that memorizing 3 digits is sufficiently easy so that a strategic response to an increased reward would not entail greater effort, because the marginal benefit of increasing one&amp;#39;s effort is simply too small (i.e. you manage to fulfill the task just fine even without increasing your effort).

Memorizing 5 digits, in contrast, is slightly more difficult, and one might actually expect some additional effort to an increase in the reward size.

Looking first, only at people to whom the reward information was given supraliminal (i.e. to be perceived consciously), the researchers find a pattern that is in support of the above hypothesis. Participants, consciously aware of how high the reward would be, behaved strategically by increasing their effort for the larger reward when the task was difficult (5 digits), but maintaining their effort level when the task was easy (3 digits).

More interesting however is the second finding, which shows this exact same response pattern to hold true also for those people to whom reward information was only provided subliminally. I.e. the strategic application of additional effort only to the task in which the marginal benefit of this additional effort appears worthwhile, occurs for conditions with supraliminal as well as subliminal information.

As the authors state it:

&amp;quot;This indicates that awareness of a reward is not a necessary condition for strategic resource recruitment to take place.&amp;quot;

;which is further confirmation that our subconscious is quite savvy indeed.

 Below is a graph of the main results:

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I’d like to thank both PZ Myers and ‘SkeptiFem’ for inspiring what I think I’ll present upon at a conference next year. I think I have something to say on this topic, which is clearly of interest to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/shes-already-got-science-women-skepticism-and-the-need-for-more-research/"&gt;women and skeptics&lt;/a&gt; before (in fact, &lt;a href="http://community.feministing.com/2009/02/women-skeptics.html"&gt;Feministing&lt;/a&gt; even responded to that post). I’ve written about &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/essays/sex-and-superstition/"&gt;women and supernatural beliefs&lt;/a&gt; before (enough that the list scrolls for quite some time!). Once again, like the email sent to a correspondent about a presentation at TAM7, where a woman was regrettably called ‘&lt;em&gt;not easy on the eye&lt;/em&gt;‘… the subject appears to be unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to be the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/the_problem_of_the_oblivious_w.php"&gt;assumption in a Pharyngula blogpost today&lt;/a&gt; is that atheism and skepticism is the same thing. Am I wrong in saying that he is &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is being put forward by ‘SkeptiFem’, the author of a post that is labeled by PZ Myers as about ‘&lt;a href="http://skeptifem.blogspot.com/2009/11/bill-maher-and-white-dude-privilege-of.html?"&gt;criticism of sexism in the skeptical community&lt;/a&gt;‘ (PZ’s words), is that it is about the supposed overlap, which makes certain atheist-based groups appear to not behave pro-skeptically and certainly not in a pro-female fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would say that &lt;em&gt;you can’t say that skepticism and atheism is the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. I was not really surprised that Maher won an ‘atheist’ award, because it wasn’t an obviously ’skeptic’ award. Not that it really makes the situation much better, since I do agree that Maher has some rather anti-science attitudes which should be of concern to anyone. Which leads me to wonder what is the real issue for both groups to tackle? Can they really do it together, when it is arguable that atheism does not have to overlap with the concerns that skeptics have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptifem.blogspot.com/2009/11/bill-maher-and-white-dude-privilege-of.html?"&gt;SkeptiFem:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Including (Hitchens) without criticism alienates and discourages women and people of color from joining up. I know I feel pretty damn alone when people I agree passionately with about things like science and critical thinking continue to dismiss feminism. The pressure that is being put on Maher recently for the medical science issues actually fucking existing when no one seemed to really even speak up about the sexism is really really disappointing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…When someone does try to share the perspective of being a person of color or a woman in skeptic communities the majority of people in the groups I have encountered dismiss their viewpoint on extremely typical grounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Short aside – I have addressed the issue of &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/03/retrospectacle-the-sarah-silverman-of-skepticism/"&gt;Christopher Hitchens and his views on women and comedy&lt;/a&gt;, in case you were wondering…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe SkeptiFem hasn’t looked around beyond some of the forum boards that she has mentioned in her post, perhaps. It seems more odd to me, however, that Pharyngula hasn’t done much ‘looking around’ either. I would have thought that he would have known something of the history of women contributing to skepticism – &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/02/shes-already-got-science-women-skepticism-and-the-need-for-more-research/"&gt;a summary of such presenters and earlier commentaries&lt;/a&gt; are readily found – I even presented on the topic of ‘&lt;em&gt;On Sex, Smarts and Where The SkepGrrls At: An Investigation into Gender Differences and Belief In Weird Things&lt;/em&gt;‘ at the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QTXK7OIq6I"&gt;Australian Skeptics conference in Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been an episode of the radio show &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/episodes/19-gender-the-skeptical-community"&gt;Skeptically Speaking on Gender and Skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, which went into depth the response of a Facebook group about promoting women in skepticism. I’ve written at length in the past (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=329"&gt;She’s Already Got Science – Women, Skepticism And The Need For More Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) and in response to the ‘&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/#/group.php?gid=97394283740&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;Women for More Women at TAM8&lt;/a&gt;‘ Facebook group (&lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1477"&gt;On Skeptic Conferences&lt;/a&gt;‘ &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/07/on-skeptic-conferences-part-two/"&gt;On Skeptic Conferences – Part Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to raise that point which seems (to me alone perhaps?) to be a contradiction in the Pharyngula blogpost. In addition, when PZ writes “I don’t think the leaders of the atheist movement are consciously anti-feminist at all” – that’s certainly able to be supported, since&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/"&gt; PZ Myers, is going be presenting at this conference in Australia next year&lt;/a&gt;, for a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me wonder why he seemed to overlook it? When he writes ‘&lt;em&gt;The problem isn’t dismissal. It’s casual disregard&lt;/em&gt;‘… did he notice the line-up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Atheism 2010 Global Atheist Convention – women presenting: Taslima Nasrin, Catherine Deveny, Sue-Ann Post, Lyn Allison, Leslie Cannold, Maggie Millar, Jano Caro, Kylie Sturgess and Tanya Levin. There is a panel of women on the Saturday – chaired by Maggie Millar featuring Lyn Allison, Tanya Levin, Leslie Cannold and Jane Caro.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a matter of PZ not attending conferences like Dragon*Con (written about in &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=412"&gt;Why Dragon*Con?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, which has grown in numbers and certainly has more women presenting across both the Skeptic and Science tracks there. But there is no ‘atheist’ track – and the atheists who did attend presented on the Skeptic track. I can’t say if there would have been a difference if there was an atheist track, however. So, getting more data, as always, is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have found it a little confusing how PZ Myers seemed to think that skepticism and atheism were the same thing. I hope that more people indeed start looking beyond a few popular-male-dominated-commentary sites. Which wouldn’t be a bad thing in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, congrats to you Ray Comfort. You have truly surpassed all previous Attie award winners. You have  slandered a man (Darwin), you have made all Christians look like ignorant boobs, and worst of all, you have caused people to question the validity of Christ through your dishonesty. You were in the zone today, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let me grow up and choose for myself.” And in the background we see a bunch of religious labels:&lt;/p&gt;

He’s the 10-year-old who refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in school because of the lack of marriage equality in the U.S. He’s already got several Facebook Fan Pages like &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Will-Phillips/334511190383?ref=search&amp;amp;sid=831430.2467403630..1"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. And he adorably&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcAWn7Rp9s"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;appeared on CNN the other night:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/MOcAWn7Rp9s%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-11-17-09/"&gt;I also blogged about Daniel Royston&lt;/a&gt;, the Wasilla, Alaska high schooler who, inspired by Will Phillips, also refused to stand for the Pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now there’s &lt;strong&gt;Roxanne Westover&lt;/strong&gt;, a 17-year-old from Ohio who also now made news for not standing for the Pledge after learning in her history class that she didn’t have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m an atheist, and I believe the pledge isn’t something toward our nation,” she said. “It’s more like a religious oath, and I believe that if I stand I’m still participating in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like with the previous cases, she’s being punished for doing so, despite the fact that such punishments are violating their civil rights. The ACLU contacted the school, so now it looks like there won’t any further punishment from school administrators at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westover said she encourages others with similar beliefs to stand up for them by sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do encourage students to not stand up and to stand up for what they believe in,” she said. “Even throughout the whole entire thing, I had a lot of people backing me up who felt the same way about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxanne made a point to say that her actions have nothing to do with &lt;strong&gt;Will Phillips&lt;/strong&gt; but that she supports his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2009/11/dinkytown_dad_s.php"&gt;d’Armond Speers taught his child only Klingon for first three years&lt;/a&gt;. Yeaaah, that’s worrisome. Not just because the kid only knows how to speak Klingon but let’s not ignore the fact that the father must have been fluent enough in it to speak nothing but Klingon around his son. And yet he claims to not even be much of a Star Trek fan. Sure you’re not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“I was interested in the question of whether my son, going through his first language acquisition process, would acquire it like any human language,” Speers told the Minnesota Daily. “He was definitely starting to learn it.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations d’Armond. If your goal was to raise your kid as a freak, may I just say &lt;em&gt;KAPLA&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Ever have a friend diagnose you with something they have had previously?With the internet today more and more people are taking initiative to diagnose themselves.  New research shows there is some merit in telling your doctor what you believe you may have. The British Medical Journal recently published an article discussing the new phenomenon of “Self Diagnosis” or “Self Labeling”.Reports have been made that “Self Diagnosis” can initiate a correct finding in 18% of consultations. Furthermore, the “presenting complaint” of a patient may guide the diagnosing process 70% of the time. This indicates the importance of a patient communication to their doctor. If you have multiple symptoms a diagnosis may be established by your initial complaint.Conditions accurately diagnosed by self labeling: Urinary tract infections, recurrent uveitis, schistosomiasis and head lice.However, don&amp;#39;t over estimate the power of self diagnosis. Wrongful incidence of self diagnosis can occur when treatment is initiated by the patient before consulting their doctor. Women who purchase over the counter antifungal treatment with the suspicion of having an infection are a great example.  A high percentage of these women actually have a bacterial form of infection not fungal.In addition, self diagnosis can be at times very unsafe. Cases have been reported of a heart attack being mistaken as indigestion and rectal bleeding thought to be due to haemorrhoids only to be discovered as colon cancer.Conditions often misdiagnosed by self labeling: pregnancy, yeast infections and scabies....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I recently came across this article by Rosengren and Hickling about how children explain seemingly impossible or extraordinary transformations in terms of magic or trickery or natural/physical explanations based on their ages and developmental level.

To summarize the study , I’m presenting the abstract:

But, man, that would have taken hundreds of thousands of words.  My amazing science aside, there are a bazillion reasons I am hot and I have not the time to list them all.  Speaking of time to write, I have poured myself a glass of almond champagne and I am ready to answer this letter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Isis, Creator of Hot Science, Guardian of Fabulous Shoes (and scientists' right to wear them), and overall Light of the Universe,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How on Earth (or any other planet) do you make time to write?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I first stumbled upon your blog last year, just after your move to ScienceBlogs. I read as often as I can, but being a first year veterinary student doesn't leave me a lot of minutes to rub together. That being said, I keep a blog mainly for the benefit of family and friends who want to keep up with my adventures. I certainly have plenty I'd like to say, but find it challenging finding, or making, or protecting the time to do so. Is it about protecting a chunk of time every day (I'd even settle for every week!)? Do you write a little bit in all the little extra minutes you find, wherever you find them? Do you take notes throughout the day and then turn them into a post in the evening? I'd love to hear any tips you might have to share. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most sincerely,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Herriot*&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
*inspired by your psuedonym(ity?) &lt;br&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/janeherriot.blogspot.com"&gt;janeherriot.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;, if you're curious). [I was curious, and I checked it out.  Your blog is adorable and I'd encourage my readers to go give it a gander!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get this question a lot.  I mean, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  Just the other day, one of my favorite Twitter followers @Glfadkt tweeted &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Glfadkt/status/5694423872"&gt;the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;@drisis When do you find time for doing that hot research? Or sleeping?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not easy, and I really don't sleep enough.  During the week, I'm a 5-6 hour a night kind of gal and we have begun a new study that frequently requires my attention overnight.  While I don't recommend it, I seem to function alright this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, here&amp;#39;s the secret to my blogging:  it&amp;#39;s not quite my first day at the rodeo.  Although I&amp;#39;ve only been Isis the Scientist for about 18 months, I started blogging about 8 years ago under circumstances much like Jane Herriot&amp;#39;s.  I was in school, away from home, missing the people I love, and was looking for an outlet to talk about the things that were going on.   I didn&amp;#39;t post every day, and I didn&amp;#39;t always post anything profound.    At one point when I was writing my dissertation, I posted this to my blog:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blech!   I just had this for lunch:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img alt="campbells soup.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/campbells%20soup.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="157" width="152"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And let me tell you, I do NOT recommend it.  It took at least 1/4 cup of salt 
to make it not taste like licking my own ass.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This shit is not fit for human consumption.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;


&lt;br&gt;Not exactly a triumph in blog journalism.  I also posted this little gem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the time of my youth I really liked American Apparel.  I would get t-shirts 
there and I always thought they were really hip.  Well, today while I was 
looking at &lt;a href="http://perezhilton.com/"&gt;Perez Hilton&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I looked at Perez instead of running/biking), I 
saw an ad for American Apparel advertising these:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img alt="american apparel 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/american%20apparel%201.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="305" width="305"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And at first I thought that American Apparel had simply lost its nut thinking 
that today&amp;#39;s woman/girl would wear such craziness.  But apparently American 
Apparel does not think that today&amp;#39;s woman/girl will wear such craziness because, 
as soon as I clicked Perez&amp;#39;s link I realized something....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img alt="american apparel 2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/american%20apparel%202.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="417" width="417"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even though American Apparel advertises these as hot pants for women, they 
are clearly being worn by a man.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And he looks better in them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As a new blogger, that really worked for me. I had a happy little non-demanding audience of maybe 150 of my friends and family members, updating them on my life, my little family, and generally about my work. Heck, it worked for me for almost 7 years.  It was an opportunity to share things about my life that I didn&amp;#39;t have time to call and everyone personally and it let me maintain a little community of the people I loved that I couldn&amp;#39;t maintain in real life.  There was also zero pressure to regularly post because that audience was very forgiving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then when I moved to my current MRU, I found myself writing a lot more about science and my career.  I think my happy little audience got bored with my science meanderings and I decided to start a new, more science-focused blog as Isis the Scientist.  I don&amp;#39;t know where I figured it all would go, but I became a part of a new community that I really value.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My move to ScienceBlogs has created a new community that I value, but also a new set of expectations.  For example, I am under contract to post a particular number of posts per week.  While I have never known them to be enforcers of this requirement, I generally try to meet it.  I also am paid a modest, but generally competitive, stipend based on the amount of traffic I generate.  So, that adds a little extra pressure. One of you once asked why &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/the_state_of_the_blog.php#comment-2047672"&gt;I say I feel guilty when I don't blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Well,  I figure if I get paid because you show up here, I should probably put something up for you to read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, blogging as Isis the Scientist has been far from a personal money making endeavor.  My blog revenues have allowed me to increase my personal philanthropy to science organizations and charity.  Last year, including my donation to the David Bruce Award (which I intend to repeat this year), I was able to make about $2000 in pseudonymous donations to different organizations from your clicks.  That&amp;#39;s a lot of click-y power.  I also get a lot of letters from my readers that I try to answer and I take that very seriously.  In that sense, I look at my Science Blog as a service activity and devote as much time to it as I would any regular service activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being Isis the Scientist is not without reward.  The individuals above me at my MRU and some other important folks in my field know that I am Isis the Scientist and sometimes I get a professional bone thrown my way.  Being involved in the blogosphere has been a way for me to gain professional insights I would not have had access to if I weren&amp;#39;t Isis.  For example, I once met another scienceblogger, more senior than me in her field, and we were driving in my car.  I was complaining about something laboratory-related that I was dealing with and she said to me, &amp;quot;You make sure that when you move to be promoted that you include this in your documents.  This is a huge obstacle and you&amp;#39;ve really overcome it. It shows character.&amp;quot;  I would never thought of it that way if it weren&amp;#39;t for her, and I would have never known her if it weren&amp;#39;t for this.  So, there&amp;#39;s value in this and when something has value, you make time to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NM51qOpwcIM%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: In honor of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;my blog bff&lt;/a&gt;, here's a little vintage Lady Gaga to break up a hell of a lot of text. Also, a &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/suri-cruise-goes-shopping"&gt;creepy picture of Suri Cruise in heels&lt;/a&gt;, and a hilarious video of a &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/joyengel/boy-sees-his-first-lobster-t7"&gt;boy seeing his first lobster&lt;/a&gt;. Now, back to business. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the question this reader asked specifically is, how do I actually blog.  It&amp;#39;s different than it used to be.   When I had a personal blog, I wrote whenever I felt inspired.  Sometimes it was daily.  Sometimes it was once or twice a week.  Now, I carry a notebook where I write down hilarious tidbits of things I come across in a day.  For example, sometimes I am attending rounds, listening to whatever science-y, medicine-y stuff is going on and my mind will wander.  I think something like, &amp;quot;you know what would be hilarious?  A group of &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/6579856/Crocodile-attacked-and-killed-by-angry-hippos.html"&gt;normally chill hippos revolting and attacking a crocodile&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;  Then I write it down.  Tonight I was eating French fries with Dr. Buttercup and our technician.  I put a &lt;strike&gt;little&lt;/strike&gt; huge pile on my napkin and covered them in enough ketchup that the fries were almost invisible.  I really like ketchup.  Dr. Buttercup said, &amp;quot;If I&amp;#39;d had $20, I&amp;#39;d make her tie her hands behind her back and eat it.&amp;quot;  It was so hilariously awkwardly funny, that I had to write it down so that I could some how use it in a post (check that one off the list).  Then later, when I am ready to write, I go back to my notebook for material&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sometimes when my week is relaxed, I blog every day.  Sometimes when my week is crazy, I write 3-4 posts over the weekend and schedule them to post throughout the week.  Then the other days I post something small.  That&amp;#39;s actually where the Shoe of the Week came from.  I was stressed to come up with a post and figured I&amp;#39;d just post a pair of shoes.  Turns out, you women dig shoes.  My blogging happens around my science and family.  I look at my week, say &amp;quot;How am I going to meet the obligations for the week?  Now, where does the blogging fit?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, while how I blog might interesting to learn from, it&amp;#39;s not the only way to blog.  What&amp;#39;s most important is that you just write something when you can. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be brilliant prose.  It just has to be honest.  You&amp;#39;ve got to find what works for you and find your own voice.  I still don&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;ve really found mine, but blogging is just like everything else.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll only get better if you practice.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This blog took me 45 minutes.  Now I am going to watch and episode of Lost and go to sleep.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/ask_dr_isis_-_how_do_you_make.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/yApJ0hMxDuQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258694993433"><id gr:original-id="http://animals.about.com/b/2009/11/19/scorpionflies-the-oldest-known-animal-pollinators.htm">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f19e24bd4bcfd88</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Scorpionflies: The Oldest Known Animal Pollinators</title><published>2009-11-19T22:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T22:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/4iRjYflSrlI/scorpionflies-the-oldest-known-animal-pollinators.htm" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://animals.about.com/b/2009/11/19/scorpionflies-the-oldest-known-animal-pollinators.htm"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A new study suggests that scorpionflies that lived during the Jurassic Period fed on the nectar-like juices of seed ferns, conifers, and other primitive plants.

The tools of science fill our workbench while emotions and spirituality are left still wrapped in cellophane under the table -- pretty, and seemingly pretty useless. As such, it would seem that the humanities would have little to offer the skeptical community. What can poetry tell us of Occam's razor? How can a song express the quadratic equation?&lt;/p&gt;

A single gene or protein that acts as a switch or a dial, and has no or few entanglements with other biological systems. That lack of entanglements is important - a switch that turns one thing off and three other things on isn't of much use, at least for those of us who like our medicine without potentially lethal side-effects, but human biochemistry contains far more multi-switches than examples of any simpler construction. Evolution is based upon the promiscuous reuse of components, and almost any protein of note involved in regulating metabolism has more than one duty to perform. In any case, researchers engaged in picking apart the mechanisms underlying calorie restriction might still manage to uncover a simple switch somewhere in amidst the all complexity and chains of genes and proteins turning one another on and off. They've been hacking away the brush for some years now, but there's no shortage of undergrowth yet to be cleared.

Sure, shooter Nidal Hasan appears to have been a devout Muslim who shouted “Allahu Akbar” while he was mowing down his colleagues and who had deep respect for Anwar al-Awlaki, the spiritual adviser to the 9/11 hijackers, and whose business card described him as a Soldier (or maybe Slave) of Allah and who let his medical lectures deteriorate into diatribes about infidels and who made internet postings praising suicide bombers and who attempted to contact Al Qaeda.  That’s certainly not enough information to responsibly speculate about his motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, responsible people are stuck speculating about &lt;i&gt;what’s going to happen to him now&lt;/i&gt;.  Responsible people like &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/11/11/at-fort-hood-obama-uses-divine-judgment-as-interfaith-outreach.html"&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we do know: no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts; no just and loving God looks upon them with favor. &lt;b&gt;And for what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice—in this world, and the next.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might expect that I’d be disapproving when the President starts confidently asserting what’s going to happen in “the next” world.  But you’d be wrong.  In fact, I quickly realized that “Next-World Justice” is the key to otherwise-intractable political reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I feel pretty confident that in a generation or two, assuming we haven’t gone extinct, that we’ll look back on the current-day practice of imprisoning users and sellers of recreational drugs as some sort of medieval barbarism.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my “let’s legalize drugs, so that people don’t have to be locked behind bars for engaging in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/world/americas/24iht-dems.3272493.html"&gt;the same recreational activities you did&lt;/a&gt;” letters to the White House have not managed to elicit a response.  (Unless you count the autographed picture of &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/12/Meet-Bo-the-First-Dog/"&gt;Bo&lt;/a&gt;, which I don’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my new approach (“Drug users will suffer enough &lt;a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/sin-drugs.html"&gt;in the next world&lt;/a&gt;, so can’t we leave them alone in this one?”) seems like it has a much better chance of working, as it’s worded in Obama’s own language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my next act, I’ll try to convince the CPSC that people who sell &lt;a href="http://doodlesandnoodles.blogspot.com/2009/03/cpsia-and-vintage-books-terrible.html"&gt;pre-1985 children’s books&lt;/a&gt; will get their just deserts in the next world too! &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258683429352"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-114290401140266780">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2bb99c08efb5288e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Soul--A Rational Belief?</title><published>2009-11-20T01:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T01:07:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/7jiSPybYjeU/soul-rational-belief.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/114290401140266780/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=114290401140266780" title="13 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/03/soul-rational-belief.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Because this blog attracts readers of varying philosophical experience, I have chosen to summarize some of the philosophical concepts involved in the discussion of the mind rather than assume the reader's knowledge of them. More versed readers will forgive the often hasty generalizations of complex ideas (especially the many ideas regarding the philosophy of the mind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Christians (and many other theists) believe in a dualistic human nature--i.e. that humans are both physical and spiritual beings. In this view, there is a brain and a spiritual consciousness. It is thought that the spiritual consciousness determines a person's identity, personality, and behavior. Many theists believe this spiritual consciousness can live on after the brain and physical body of a human is destroyed. They are committed to the idea that the brain and a spiritual consciousness are independent, yet somehow linked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this post, I will argue against the plausibility of a spiritual human consciousness separate from the human brain. I will argue that the brain alone is responsible for a person's identity, personality, and behavior. After constructing a few informal philosophical arguments that rely on what I will refer to as "brain-dependence"(hereafter, BD) and conclude that the existence of a spiritual consciousness separate from the brain is implausible, I will describe and give examples for BD.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the evidence listed below, it seems indisputable that the human brain is, at least, partially responsible for a person's identity, personality, and behavior (traits traditionally ascribed to a spiritual human consciousness). If a theist agrees that the brain can affect a person's identity, personality, and behavior, they must either concede that the brain can exercise control over a person's supposed spiritual consciousness or they must believe that the spiritual consciousness can exercise control over a person but that the brain cannot affect it in any way. Both are problematic for theists who believe in a spiritual consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the brain is clearly and demonstrably responsible for some aspects of a person's identity, personality, and behavior, it does not seem unreasonable to assume that the brain is responsible for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; aspects of a person's identity, personality, and behavior. In fact, it seems as if the notion of a spiritual consciousness is completely superfluous. If human identity, personality, and behavior can be determined by the brain it seems that this is the most natural explanation of human (non-spiritual consciousness). Any further additions would seem to violate Ockham's razor--the principle that one should not multiply explanations when a simple one answers the question (e.g. If I saw a George Washington standing over a freshly-cut cherry tree with an axe, it would be illogical for me to argue that aliens flew down and knocked the tree over with their laser blaster. The simplest explanation is that GW chopped the tree down. In the same way, if the brain can be responsible for a person's identity, personality, and behavior, there is no reason to posit some kind of spiritual consciousness).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If, instead, a theist asserts the transcendence of the spiritual consciousness so that it cannot be affected by the brain, many questions follow. The brain, for instance, limits learning. If a spiritual consciousness is not limited by the brain, then everything that consciousness experiences, it must retain. Every spiritual consciousness is a little Einstein, smarter even. Not only would every spiritual consciousness retain every memory and piece of information it was ever exposed to, it would also be free from the reasoning limitations of the brain. It would take all of the available information and put them together perfectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if this is the aspect of a person's self that lives on, can one really argue that she will survive her death? The spiritual consciousness is not at all like the consciousness that a person is aware of after the brain has limited it. It is smarter, more well-reasoned, has more memories, and doesn't even share the same body as the one a person has been aware of. The person emerging from death wouldn't be anything like who they were in life. That person would have truly died and a new entity (an unlimited spiritual consciousness) would live on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BD states that there is an inextricable link between the human brain and human consciousness. It has been shown that altering part of the brain alters certain states of consciousness and that the destruction of parts of the brain destroys certain states of consciousness. Furthermore, it has been empirically verified that every thought corresponds to an occurrence in the brain. Steven Pinker, a psycholinguist, says, "We know that every form of mental activity -- every emotion, every thought, every percept -- gives off electrical, magnetic, or metabolic signals that can be recorded with increasing precision by Positron Emission Tomography, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetoencephalography, and other techniques." Adam Marczyk writes, "there is no aspect of the mind that does not correspond to any area of the brain."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many examples of how human consciousness is affected by brain injury (I am indebted to Adam Marczyk's article "A Ghost in the Machine" for most of the specific examples). I may have gone a little overboard with the actual cases (I thought they were interesting), so if you want to read a couple&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anterograde amnesia is the inability to form new memories (if you are familiar with the movie, Momento, the main character has this disorder). Conifer writes, "Dr. Kenneth Heilman tells us of a patient named Flora Pape whose left and right fornices [the area of the brain responsible for memory] both had to be excised to save her from a life-threatening brain tumor. Mrs. Pape had lived in east Kentucky all of her life, until she and her husband both moved to Jacksonville, Florida, two years before her surgery. At the time of her surgery, she had two sons in their 20s, both of whom still lived in Kentucky." Heilman recounts what took place after leaving the hospital:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When she was discharged from the hospital, her husband drove her from Gainesville to their home in Jacksonville. After leaving Gainesville, her husband noticed that she was looking out the window and saying, "Oh, my!" He asked what was troubling her and she said, "What happened to the mountains?"&lt;br&gt;He asked, "What mountains?"&lt;br&gt;She replied, "You know, the mountains."&lt;br&gt;He said, "There are no mountains here."&lt;br&gt;She replied, "No mountains in Kentucky. We must be in the western part of the state. What are we doing here?"&lt;br&gt;Mr. Pape had been told by [the doctor] that the surgery might make her memory worse, but he was still surprised. "Dear, we are not in Kentucky. We are in Florida."&lt;br&gt;She asked, "Why are we in Florida?"&lt;br&gt;He told her that they had moved to Jacksonville about 2 years earlier. She said, "Moved to Jacksonville? Why?" He told her that the company had asked him to transfer. She asked, "Where are we going now?"&lt;br&gt;"Back to Jacksonville from Gainesville. You had some surgery on your brain. It was a tumor. The doctors think they got it all out. You are having some memory problems, but the surgeons hope it will improve with time."&lt;br&gt;Then she asked, "Who is watching the boys?"&lt;br&gt;"No one," he replied. "They are grown and live in Kentucky."&lt;br&gt;"What do you mean, grown? They are still teenagers."&lt;br&gt;"No, they are not. They are in their twenties. They are coming down this weekend to see you."&lt;br&gt;She stopped asking questions for a few minutes and looked out of the car window. Then she turned to her husband and asked, "Where are all the mountains?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, is this wife really the same person she was before the surgery? What does it mean to be you? Are you not a product of your memories? Are you the same person now that you were two years ago?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This also introduces other problems for religious theists. What if this wife had been an atheist two years before the surgery, but had then become a theist (let's say, a Christian theist). After the surgery, however, she only remembers her reasons for not believing in a god. She, now, espouses the strong atheism she held prior to the surgery. Is she or is she not a Christian?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point is that if there is a spiritual consciousness that exists outside of the brain, why does damage to the brain change a person's identity? A person is a collection of their thoughts and memories (e.g. If I were asked to describe myself, I would talk about what I've experienced, what I think, what I do for a living, etc. All of these descriptions would change if I lost two years of my life like Mrs. Pape).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some religious theists argue that, perhaps, the soul/consciousness works through the brain and, if the brain is damaged, has trouble expressing its true self. A disorder known as callosal disconnection raises some interesting questions about this theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The right and left hemispheres of the brain can be naturally (by a stroke) or surgically disconnected (this is done for patients with severe epilepsy to help with seizures). The hemispheres of the brain lose the ability to communicate with one another. These two hemispheres can gain a consciousness exclusive of one another. An interesting example is of a patient was asked what his ideal profession was. Verbally (a function of the left hemisphere), the man said draftsman. When asked to spell it out using blocks with his left hand (which is controlled by the right hemisphere), the man spelled "automobile race." It seems that, in the same person, there were two consciousnesses--one wanted to be a draftsman, the other a racer.&lt;br&gt;A more interesting (and, more frightening example) can be seen in alien hand syndrome. One recorded case is about a woman who came to her doctor because, every now and then, her left hand would try to strangle her to death. The doctor checked her for psychiatric disorders, but found no evidence of any. He theorized that if she had experienced a natural callosal disconnection in her brain, her right hemisphere might have suicidal tendencies and might be trying to act out on them (the right hemisphere cannot communicate verbally, and it has been shown that the left hemisphere is responsible for controlling most erratic behaviors). After she died of unrelated causes, the autopsy showed that she had, in fact, experienced a callosal disconnection. Subsequent cases have substantiated alien hand syndrome. (In another case, a man's left hand attacked his wife and he had to use his right hand to stop it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can two consciousnesses (or "souls" for many theists) be explained within the same person? Is there a devil in one hemisphere and an angel in the other? Does the spiritual consciousness of one hemisphere go to heaven and the other to hell (assuming religious traditions believing in reward and punishment)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Capgras syndrome has the unusual effect of causing a person to suddenly insist that a loved-one is an imposter. When a person meets someone else, they "start a file" on that person. The limbic system of the brain recognizes familiar faces and accesses emotional centers connected with those faces. If the face is that of a loved-one, the limbic system accesses positive emotional centers. If that limbic system is damaged, however, a person will recognize the familiar face, but will not have the same emotional connection with that face. They cannot believe that it is the same person. The brain starts another file for this person who looks like a loved-one but does not have a positive emotion associated with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can't this person's soul recognize his "soul-mate"? Why doesn't the spiritual consciousness hold on to this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phineas Gage had his ventromedial prefrontal cortex blown out in a dynamiting accident. Before the accident, he was a kind-hearted, reasonable, well-liked man. After the accident, though, he became mean-spirited and ill-tempered. The part of his brain that was damaged is the part that is believed to control normal decision-making and social skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anecdotally, my brother-in-law knows a person that demonstrates signs of this syndrome. He knew a Christian man who was a very loving husband and father. After an automobile accident in which he sustained a head injury, he became both verbally and physically abusive to his wife and young children. The doctors and his family blamed the behavior on his head trauma. The injury, however, completely altered his personality. He was a different person after the injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both cases raise difficult questions about the responsibility of any soul in so-called "sinful action." If Gage's spiritual consciousness existed outside of his mind, is that spiritual consciousness morally responsible for his post-trauma behavior? Is the Christian man now in sin because of his actions and his failure to live up to his wedding vows? He promised to love his wife until death, but now he hates her and denies that she is who she is. Further, if sin can be blamed on the brain and not the spiritual consciousness, can it be argued that all sin occurs because of the brain and the spiritual consciousness (if it existed) cannot be held responsible for any action?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frontotemporal dementia in the right hemisphere of the brain has been shown to affect "food and dress choice, political ideology, social behavior, sexual preference, and [even] religion." Now, if a person is ultimately judged for the religion they choose, what are the ramifications if someone walks away from her religion because of a deterioration of her brain? Isn't this supposed to be a decision made by a person's consciousness/soul? Will they be judged because of a condition of their brain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Jesuit priest had a stroke that damaged the right hemisphere of his brain. After the accident, he lost the ability to have intense emotions. He joked when his parents told him that his sister had leukemia and he lost all of his passion for his ministry. His parents complained to the doctor, "That's not the way our son acted before he became sick . . . He now sounds like a robot."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is the priests "true self"? What happened to his spiritual consciousness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Mary" was a student at an Ivy-league school. During her first two years, she did extremely well. She was a devout Baptist who did not drink or sleep around. During her third year, however, Mary became belligerent to other people, started drinking heavily, and became very sexually active. She could not explain why her behavior had changed so dramatically. An MRI revealed that Mary had a tumor in the frontal lobes of her brain (the area of the brain that controls impulses). Almost immediately after the removal of the tumor, Mary's behavior changed back to what it was before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another man was a teacher who suddenly became obsessed with sex with minors. He was convicted on molestation charges. He said that he couldn't understand why he couldn't resist his impulses. An MRI revealed that he, too, had a tumor in the frontal lobes of his brain. After the removal, the man claimed that he no longer had the desire for aberrant sex acts. A few years later, though, the man started having headaches and began buying pornography again. He went to the doctor and an MRI revealed that the tumor had begun growing back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hard-working Baptist minister who had refused pay from his church (choosing, rather, to support himself so that the church could direct funds elsewhere) began showing up late for appointments, then skipping them altogether, then doing nothing but sitting in front of the TV even choosing to urinate on himself rather than go to the bathroom. An MRI showed that there was a tumor pressing on his frontal lobes. After the removal of the tumors, he began faithfully working again and living an active life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the spiritual consciousness exists, why does a tumor affect a person's identity so much? Who that person is is affected by his or her brain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, I argued that theists who believe in the existence of a spiritual consciousness face the difficult challenge of making room for it. If they believe agree that the brain can affect identity, personality, and behavior, then, it seems that the brain is the most natural and easiest explanation of all identity, personality and behavior. Adding the concept of a spiritual consciousness violates the principle of Ockham's razor. If, instead, the theist believes that a spiritual consciousness can affect the brain, but cannot be affected by the brain, then the spiritual consciousness would be much different than the consciousness of which the person is aware, and if the spiritual consciousness lived on, it would not be the same person. I, then, attempted to prove BD through case studies that demonstrate that the brain can affect identity, personality, and behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;After posting this in my former blog, I got this comment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I think there are a few areas lacking in your post. First, you don’t address the problem of qualia . . . the fact that I thought that a painting is beautiful cannot be reduced to any physical fact about my brain and central nervous system (also another problem with qualia).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I responded (in part):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who have not done much study in the philosophy of the mind, qualia are the subjective experiences of things, the difference between "knowing about" something and "knowing" something. The classical example is of a fictional woman who had never experienced color (only black and white). She studies all about color and knows how they affect the brain, but until she actually sees a color, she does not really "know" it. This sujective knowledge (compared to objective knowledge) is a qualia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dualists often argue that this indicates that there is something non-physical in our consciousness, something that is beyond the brain. Two additional medical cases (also from ) may be relevent to this "problem":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain asymbolia occurs through brain damage and causes patients to lose all subjective responses (but not physical perceptions) of phenomena. The patient will know the difference between hot and cold, but will no longer have any subjective response to it. After having nerves in the brain surgically severed because of chronic, intense pain, one patient commented, "The pain is the same, but I feel much better now." The patient's subjective experience of pain was altered physically by a procedure on the brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synesthesia is a condition that mixes the subjective experiences people have of things. One woman can actually taste different musical tones. Not only does she hear them, she also tastes them. She can distinguish between tones by taste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of these examples show that there is a physical basis for qualia. Adding a spiritual consciousness is, again, multiplying necessities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;. . . [On beauty]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a friend who had a neurological condition that changed her tastes. Things that she enjoyed eating before, tasted terrible to her after. It certainly seems that the fact that she thought something tasted good could "be reduced to any physical fact about [her] brain and central nervous system."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also think this is covered in my discussion of Capgras syndrome. This is the condition that causes people not to have the same emotional responses to familiar faces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Steven Pinker's &lt;i&gt;How the Mind Works&lt;/i&gt; he discusses how art "tickles" parts of the brain so that the person enjoys them. Also, beauty can rely heavily on the senses (e.g. a person can have a poor olafactory response to say, wine, and not be able to distinguish between certain tastes that someone with a greater sense).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted 3/20/06&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-114290401140266780?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I’ll just check in on my good friend ChicagoTribune.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-oprah-winfrey-show-end-link,0,6527512.story"&gt;OPRAH IS GOING OFF THE AIR&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: What the WHAT?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: No, for serious, she’s quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Please… please tell me and my vajayjay and my cancer curing herbal moisturizing cream that this is not a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: Elyse, it’s our top fucking story. You don’t announce Oprah leaving television… especially in Chicago… without a professional (and maybe even very personal literal) death wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: I’m sorry… I was screaming outside like a crazy person and hugging people walking by with their dogs. I might have to register with the state every time I move now but… Oprah’s quitting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: Yes. She’s quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Leaving TV? FOREVER?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: Probably not, but she’s ending her show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: [running back outside and hugging more dogs] OPRAH’S GOING OFF THE AIR FOREVER AND NEVER RETURNING TO TV EVER!!!!! AGAIN!!!!! ChicagoTribune.com said so! CHICAGO TRIBUNE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: Elyse, we didn’t say that. We never said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: THEY SAID IT! THEY SAAAAAAAAAIIIIIID IT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChicagoTribune.com: Our legal department will be contacting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca: Elyse, quit acting like a crazy asshole and blog this… without getting us sued by the Trib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… Yeah… Oprah has announced that tomorrow she will announce that 2010-2011 will be the very last ever season of The Oprah Winfrey Show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably shouldn’t get so excited just yet. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While the good news is that she will be stepping down from her Day Time Talk Throne, and will be giving up her daily one-hour network television woo-cast, the bad news is that she still owns two cable stations. And speculation is that she’s leaving the show to focus on these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could very well mean that the Jenny McCarthy show will be getting lots of Oprah hands-on TLC… but not in a dirty way… because Jenny is covered in weird kid diseases that most people vaccinate against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens, this is obviously not the end of Oprah… it is only the end of Oprah as we know her. She will be around. She will be the most powerful person in the world. She will be terrorizing the planet with dangerous claims and continuing to teach women that “vulva” and “vagina” are dirty girl parts that should only be discussed euphemistically with a goofy comic face to further imply that “ooh I’m talking about something totally weird!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’ll still be helping celebrities promote their medical claims. And pimping books about the power of your spirit and your mind and wanting things and how to make them happpen using your psychic powers… because not only does Oprah know how to make things happen for Oprah, she also apparently is in tune with the way you and me make things happen for ourselves. She’s very much like us… like the last time I quit my job, it made the front page of the Chicago Tribune. Seriously… it’s right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="2 weeks" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2-weeks.jpg" alt="2 weeks" width="697" height="667"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? She’s just like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway… while the end of the fucking Oprah Show is joyous indeed. (And you should celebrate it by &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Skeptics/calendar/11703641/"&gt;coming out for drinks with George Hrab and me&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow night if you’re in Chicago), I have a feeling this move is Oprah positioning herself to become more powerful. I hope I’m wrong… or I hope that she becomes more powerful and uses that power to teach women to think critically and not take everything they hear on Oprah as gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My woman’s intuition tells me to doubt that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still… OPRAH’S GOING OFF THE AIR!

Edward is therefore Judith's brother-in-law, and Michael is Susan's brother-in-law. In my usage, and what I think is standard English usage, there is no named relationship between Edward and Michael. In particular, they are not brothers-in-law. I was therefore surprised to see a news item in which men in this situation (one of whom is accused of trying to hire an assassin to kill the other) were described as brothers-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are languages in which the relationship between Edward and Michael has a name. In Carrier, this is the &lt;i&gt;-loh&lt;/i&gt; relationship. One could say &lt;i&gt;Lhloh 'uhint'oh&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;they are each other&amp;#39;s spouse&amp;#39;s sibling&amp;#39;s spouse/sibling&amp;#39;s spouse&amp;#39;s sibling&amp;quot;. (For extra credit, try to pronounce the onset cluster [ɬl].) German &lt;i&gt;Schwippschwager&lt;/i&gt; seems to mean the same thing. The term "co-brother-in-law" is apparently used by some authors as a translation of such terms, but doesn't seem to be in natural use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm wondering is whether the news item that described Edward and Michael as brothers-in-law is simply in error or whether there are native English speakers for whom this is correct usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258680224169"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18457">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e49a789b8f0c0c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Jesse Galef"/><title type="html">Jesse Back from UnreasonableFaith</title><published>2009-11-20T01:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T01:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/19/jesse-back-from-unreasonablefaith/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By Jesse Galef&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t read UnreasonableFaith, you should go check it out.  I had a few posts I particularly enjoyed writing, including one looking at vigilante justice in our cultural stories (&lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/11/18/boondock-saints-or-sinners/"&gt;Boondock Saints or Sinners&lt;/a&gt;) and one on the similarities between reported alien encounters and demon encounters (&lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/11/13/aliens-vs-demons/"&gt;Aliens vs Demons&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to pick up here at FriendlyAtheist where I left off at UnreasonableFaith: inviting everyone to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2705716"&gt;add me as a friend&lt;/a&gt; on facebook and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JesseGalef"&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; on my nascent twitter account.  I’ve been looking to get more involved in the nontheistic community – both online and in person (or IRL as young folks say.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that last post I also put up a picture of myself that I’ve been thinking about long time and finally got around to doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-size:11px"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="600" alt="Galef_Bboy_Atheist" src="http://unreasonablefaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Galef_Bboy_Atheist.jpg" style="margin:0"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Jesse Galef reading The Portable Atheist while breakdancing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured The Portable Atheist is a fairly recognizable cover.  Contrary to what some on facebook are insisting, the starbursts are just my reflective Newbalance logos.  It is not God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t believe me, feel free to send money and I’ll send you more information – including pictures – of my hol(e)y shoes for you to worship.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't take &lt;a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-october-29-2009/for-fox-sake-"&gt;John Stewart to figure out they're not&lt;/a&gt;, so I knew something had to be fishy about the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea behind the article is that Fox features a similar percentage of negative coverage of Obama as other media outlets have in the past for other presidents (about 65% negative). Meanwhile, the other "liberal" news stations have a disproportionately high amount of positive coverage for Obama when compared to coverage of earlier presidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fault lies in that it's a overly simplistic system. The coverage is lumped into either "positive" or "negative". Stations can't lose extra points of coverage that gos beyond negative into racist rants, hate-filled diatribes, or tirades full of complete bullshit like their continued coverage of the Birther movement or their fanaticism with the supposed Death Panels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not thoughtful reflection of news that leads to negative coverage that make Fox the target of such criticism. It's the fact that their "negative" isn't even reality based. Furthermore, Fox uses material from its "Opinion Commentators" to pass off as "News". This study doesn't even begin to address that because of its shoe-horning into ill defined categories. When these other important criteria for judging the news worthiness of the station is added, it becomes clear Fox doesn't even belong on the scale.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-6902969588333247068?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258678456553"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-1955620188942931250">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af23e5b1b36f08f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Top 8 Dinosaur Discoveries of 2009</title><published>2009-11-20T00:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-20T00:05:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/11/top-8-dinosaur-discoveries-of-2009.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/1955620188942931250/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=1955620188942931250&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Popular Mechanics has &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4336718.html"&gt;a great article up listing their favorite dinosaur discoveries of 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's amazing to me is that &lt;i&gt;more than half&lt;/i&gt; of these are &lt;i&gt;feathered&lt;/i&gt;! Creationists always ask for transitional forms, and regardless of whether or not these new discoveries are part of the direct lineage of birds, they still show that a large family of feathered dinos existed for evolution to draw upon.

A knockout in round 1.</title><published>2009-11-19T23:48:08Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T23:48:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/coyne-vs-palin-a-knockout-in-round-1/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Matthew Cobb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media brouhaha around the publication of Sarah Palin’s new book has spread round the world, even if the BBC reporter this morning had to admit that the only real sign of public fervour at one signing was two teenagers who sat it out, alone, outside a mall bookshop overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palin is not only a figurehead for the most conservative sections of US opinion, she has now come out as a creationist. However, like many creationists, she claims to accept the existence of “microevolution”. The real issue, she claims, is that one species cannot split into two, or give rise to another species. God alone can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s her argument in all its glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“I believed in the evidence for microevolution—that geologic and species change occurs incrementally over time, (…) But I didn’t believe in the theory that human beings—thinking, loving beings—originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea. Or that human beings began as single-celled organisms that developed into monkeys who eventually swung down from trees; I believed we came about not through a random process, but were created by God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the tiresome misinterpretation that natural selection is “random” (where has any evolutionist said this?), this needs some robust rebuttal, which was provided by Jerry Coyne, in an e-mail published over at &lt;a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-11-19/sarah-palin-creationist/&amp;amp;amp;ct=ga&amp;amp;amp;cd=KGoidwxgUEI&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG9rIO1nh2tY9bHa4VLbQH9bHiECQ"&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“University of Chicago ecology and evolution professor at Jerry Coyne calls the passage in Palin’s book a “typical creationist ploy” easily refuted by fossil evidence suggesting transitions between animals as fish and amphibians or land animals and whales. “Her stand is basically a biblically oriented stand…that has no basis in fact,” Coyne told The Daily Beast in an e-mail. “It is a ridiculous ploy of the ‘duck kind,’ i.e. a canard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

Although first described by Francis Galton in the 1880s, little was known about this condition until recently. A rennaissance in synaesthesia research began about a decade ago; since then, three previously unrecognized forms of the condition have been described, and a possible explanation for how it arises have been put forward.

Of all the forms of this fascinating condition, the least researched is time-space synaesthesia, but two new studies provide some insight into it. One is a case study of an individual whose time-space synaesthesia has an apparently unique characteristic. The second demonstrates that time-space synaesthetes have superior cognitive abilities than non-synaesthetes, and suggests that time-space synaesthesia may underly the savant-like abilities of people with hyperthymestic (or "super-memory") syndrome.

Allen Orr’s piece provides an interesting historical perspective on the interaction between the science of evolution (or Darwinism) and the impacts on society. The Charlesworths provide an opinion on the importance of Darwin on genetics (note that they get the D-M speciation model wrong by suggesting that it’s anything but apathetic toward the role of natural selection). And Adam Wilkins weighs in on whether Darwin was a genius or a plodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before restaurant management asked the group to &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/group-220047-beach-weaver.html"&gt;remove the sign&lt;/a&gt; advertising their group from their table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claire Weaver&lt;/strong&gt;, an organizer of the atheist group, &lt;a href="http://mojoey.blogspot.com/2009/11/hostility-shown-towards-local-atheist.html"&gt;explained it this way&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The manager came over and told us to take the sign down. Flabbergasted, we asked why; she said she’d received several complaints (from who, she wouldn’t say – though the gray-haired man at the bar who kept giving us evil stares definitely aroused our suspicions), and the signs had to go.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did the sign say that was so offensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have to sit down for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seal Beach Atheists Meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know.  Full of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mojoey&lt;/strong&gt; was there and &lt;a href="http://mojoey.blogspot.com/2009/11/hostility-shown-towards-local-atheist.html"&gt;he has contact information&lt;/a&gt; for the tavern, in case you’d like to send them a friendly little email.&lt;/p&gt;

The very next day, I started getting calls from patients (often not may own) asking how they could get it.  I'm not fan of draconian laws that imprison people for getting stoned, but when it comes to medical interventions (rather than legal ones) I have an informed opinion.  The new law allows Michigan residents to grow weed for their own consumption if they have approval. The law &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; allow doctors to prescribe marijuana, rather it allows them to certify that the patient has a condition designated by statue as qualifying them for the medical marijuana program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I prescribe a pharmacologic intervention, I usually have some data to back up my decision.  My most commonly prescribed medications, such as metformin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, statins, and aspirin, have clear dosing options and have clear outcome data that support their use.  Marijuana is not a clearly science-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say it isn't medically useful.  There is a great deal of anecdotal data for its use in a variety of conditions, and there is scientific plausibility underlying this data.  There are also data supporting the concept of cannabis dependence, and there is scientific plausibility to support the idea that smoking anything is probably bad for you.  In other words, the available clinical data do not give a doctor a clear way to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio of pot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some circumstances, the decision is a bit more clear.  In hospice patients or other patients with end-stage diseases, there is probably little harm in using cannabis, although we don't have a lot of data here either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With marijuana, we have a drug that is not standardized, and has no clear indications for which it has been well-studied.  There is no other drug whose use I would recommend on such scant data.  There may be considerable promise in cannabis and its derivatives, but until the government allows more study, I'm not writing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/why_i_wont_be_prescribing_medi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/C2Q37o5BQdA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258669401951"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=3301">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d14cb4b2381818f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Time"/><title type="html">A Conversation on the Existence of Time</title><published>2009-11-19T21:27:07Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T21:27:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/11/19/a-conversation-on-the-existence-of-time/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, other people talk a lot about time, too — it’s not just me.  Here’s a great &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau/index.html"&gt;video from &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a conversation between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross"&gt;David Gross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/itzhak_fouxon"&gt;Itzhak Fouxon&lt;/a&gt; about the existence of time.  (Via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sc_k"&gt;Sarah Kavassalis&lt;/a&gt;.)  Itzhak plays the role of the starry-eyed young researcher — he opens the video by telling us how he originally went into physics to impress girls, although apparently he has stuck with it for other reasons.  Gross, of course, shared a Nobel Prize for asymptotic freedom, and has become one of the most influential string theorists around.  David plays the role of the avuncular elder statesman (I’ve seen him be somewhat more acerbic in his criticisms) — but he’s one of the smartest people in physics, and his admonitions are well worth listening to.  He gives some practical advice, but also advises young people to think big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the video doesn’t seem to be embeddable, but you can go to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau/index.html"&gt;the video page&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “David Gross” entry.  (The others are good, too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all know my perspective here — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/24/what-if-time-really-exists/"&gt;time probably exists&lt;/a&gt;, and we should try to understand it rather than replace it.  But I’ll agree with David — let’s not ignore more “practical” problems, but not be afraid to tackle the big ideas!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258669029378"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/interesting_ethical_question_w.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9504421d77dc50d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Interesting ethical question:  When a DNA testing firm closes, who gets the data?</title><published>2009-11-19T22:02:05Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T22:02:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/1Sd5RmufO_M/interesting_ethical_question_w.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/interesting_ethical_question_w.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
An Icelandic firm that offers private DNA testing to customers has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., raising privacy concerns about the fate of customer DNA samples and records, according to the Times of London.

&lt;p&gt;DeCODE Genetics, a genetics research firm, began offering personalized DNA testing through its deCODEme website two years ago. A customer mails in a sample taken from the inside of his cheek, and the service calculates the subject's genetic risk for disease -- cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some automated face-detecting software uses color as one cue that something is a face. For example Apple's iPhoto has no trouble determining that there are two faces in this color picture:

That's Nora in the back, and her cousin Ginger in front. In this picture, however, iPhoto can't identify a face:

That's a vintage black-and-white photo of Nora and Ginger's grandfather, but the computer can't find any faces in it. Do people, like computers, use color to help decide whether something they see is a face? Humans are excellent at identifying colors, and while faces can be many colors, there are also many colors that are very rarely seen in faces (e.g. blue, green, orange). Could we use skin-tones to help identify faces?

Markus Bindemann and Mike Burton created a set of images with faces placed in random locations, like this: Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Not in a creepy way, but in a waiting-in-an-airport-for-my-flight kind of way. Perhaps “observe” is a better term than “watch”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, whether it be in preparation for a social gathering, an athletic competition, a trip, a purchase, an encounter with a stranger, or any number of other things, I notice people getting ready by deploying all kinds of rituals; a young lady plays jazz CDs and drinks a glass of wine while applying her make-up before a date; a basketball player refuses to speak to his teammates while he stretches in the locker room; a commuter sets subway passes and a book on the table in the foyer each night before bed; a homeless man belts out an incoherent chant before he throws trash at me; a writer circles her desk three times before sitting down to write. The methods of preparation are very interesting and often unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about you?&lt;/p&gt;

Man facing five years for doing his civic duty&lt;/em&gt;" and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Man arrested just for handing gun in at police station&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result of this interest, my &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/11/paul-clarkes-shotgun.html"&gt; Blogpost on the case&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that there was something to be said for possession of a shotgun being unlawful, received over 11,000 hits in two days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my Blogpost I was careful to note that, in this particular case, bringing the prosecution and the mandatory minimum sentence may both be &lt;em&gt;asses&lt;/em&gt;, even if the underlying law was sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a follow-up to that Blogpost, and as an exercise in trying to show the value of legal blogging, I will now set out the fuller context to this prosecution. The following is based on original research and various interviews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you believe that this case is an injustice (which is my opinion), then this information will enable you to identify the stage or stages in the process where the injustice lies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it the strict liability offence itself?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mandatory minimum sentence of five years?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The arrest and charge at the Police Station?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decision to prosecute by the Crown Prosecution Service?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court hearing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The jury's conviction?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, if you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think it is an injustice, at least you may be better informed about how any injustice was avoided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Offence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Clarke was charged with the offence under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt; section 5(1)(aba) of the Firearms Act 1968&lt;/a&gt;. This provides that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A person commits an offence if, without the authority of the Defence Council..., he has in his possession, or purchases or acquires, or manufactures, sells or transfers...any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in length or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, other than an air weapon, a muzzle-loading gun or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a strict liability offence: the simple possession of such a weapon constitutes the crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a basic and general prohibition would appear to be sensible in any gun control regime (and I strongly favour gun control), but it does have very problematic implications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One such implication was set put by my fellow skeptic, Mike Ward, who writes as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Schroedinger99"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schroedinger99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In his excellent and thoughtful &lt;a href="http://badreason99.blogspot.com/2009/11/ignorance-of-law-and-paul-clarke-case.html"&gt;Blogpost on Paul Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, he sets out the following scenario:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Suppose I found a loaded gun in a park frequented by children (though deserted at the time of my discovery) and did not have my mobile phone on me. What should I do? Leave it there? Hide it? Take it to the police and rely on the good will of the CPS?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this situation, which I will now call &lt;em&gt;Schroedinger's Shotgun&lt;/em&gt;, there is no easy answer. Picking up and taking the gun to the Police would, in principle, incur criminal liability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be that one would not be arrested, charged, or prosecuted; or it may be that one would be able perhaps to run (a rarely successful) defence of necessity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Good Samaritan with Schroedinger's Shotgun would be commiting a criminal act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, with strict liability offences, there should always be flexibility in respect of when prosecutions are bought and flexibility also in sentencing. It is by these means that a just legal system ensures that a strict liability offence does not lead to injustice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Punishment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is intended to be no flexibility in the sentencing for those convicted of the section 5 offence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under &lt;a href="http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1968/cukpga_19680027_en_8#pt3-l1g65"&gt; section 51A(5)(a)(i) of the Firearms Act 1968&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;"'the required minimum term' means..in relation to England and Wales...(i)in the case of an offender who was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, five years".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only exception is provided for under section 51A(2):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The court shall impose an appropriate custodial sentence (or order for detention) for a term of at least the required minimum term (with or without a fine) unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender which justify its not doing so."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word "exceptional" ensures that the mere circumstances of the offence or the offender are not enough: in either case the circumstances must be exceptional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mandatory minimum sentence, however, was not always the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandatory minimum sentences for a range of firearms offences were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, one of the most notorious and illiberal statutes ever passed by Parliament. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_Act_2003#Passage_through_Parliament"&gt; director of the pressure group Liberty &lt;/a&gt;stated: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In years to come, as more innocent people emerge after years in prison caused by these plans, we'll wonder how Parliament let this shameful attack on justice get into law".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The legislation relating to mandatory minimum sentences for a range of firearms offences were not even properly scrutinised by Parliament. They were introduced at the very late (and post committee) "Report stage".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing the raft of late amendments, the Lord Chancellor &lt;a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2003/jun/16/criminal-justice-bill"&gt; stated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Clauses 271 to 276 introduce a mandatory minimum sentence for firearms offences. This is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment both to deter criminals from using firearms and to ensure that they receive an appropriately tough custodial sentence on conviction."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These were warmly supported by Labour peer Lord Harris of Harringey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Clause 271 sets out minimum sentences for unauthorised use of firearms which are welcome. I sincerely hope that they will act as a deterrent to the routine carrying of firearms as a fashion accessory, the risk of which is that a minor dispute or scuffle can quickly escalate into a serious incident in which a firearm is used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a recent case an individual was shot by someone with whom he had had a minor dispute on a dance floor. The bullet killed the first victim, and, having passed through him, travelled through a partition wall and killed a second unrelated victim. If this clause proves an effective deterrent in reducing the number of people carrying firearms in public, such incidents will become less likely and public safety will be improved and lives saved."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, a more sensible position was stated by the Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Dholakia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Equally objectionable are the provisions for minimum sentences, both those relating to firearms offences in Clauses 271 to 276 and those relating to life sentence tariffs in Schedule 17. Minimum sentences are fundamentally wrong because they prevent judges from doing justice to offenders by tailoring the sentence to the individual circumstances of the case. They are wrong because they deter guilty pleas, unnecessarily put witnesses through the trauma of giving evidence and, because of the difficulties witnesses face, sometimes produce wrongful acquittals of offenders. In those cases the offenders will walk free, although they would have pleaded guilty if they had not been confronted with a draconian minimum sentence."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The Lords debate is also notable for the well-informed reservations of two Law Lords - Woolf and Ackner - at the restrictions on sentencing discretion throughout the bill.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The distinguished Joint Lords and Commons Select Committee on Human Rights then issued a &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtrights/118/118.pdf"&gt; damning report &lt;/a&gt;on the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including the provisions on mandatory minimum sentences for firearms. The report stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We consider that doubts about the ability of courts to take account of a defendant’s personal circumstances when sentencing mean that there is a risk of a violation of ECHR Articles 3 and 6.1 in individual cases."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Article 3 covers punishments; Article 6.1 covers fair trials.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Committee's Report further stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This [provision] would require a court to sentence a person convicted of certain offences under section 5 of that Act to a minimum term of imprisonment of five years if the defendant was aged 18 or over at the time of the offence, and three years if he was aged 16 or 17 at that time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this prevents a court from having regard to the circumstances of the particular&lt;br&gt;offence and the individual offender when passing sentence, it could deprive him or her of a fair hearing, violating ECHR Article 6.1, and fail to treat him with appropriate respect for his or her humanity...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the case of this clause, however, new section 51A(2) of the 1968 Act would allow the court not to sentence to the statutory minimum term if it is ‘of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender which justify its not doing so.’ In relation to mandatory life sentences for repeat offenders, the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) has discharged its responsibility under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to give a somewhat extended meaning to the term ‘exceptional circumstances’justifying not imposing the life sentence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is not clear what would count as an exceptional circumstances in the context of a variable sentence with a minimum term for an offence involving firearms, rather than a mandatory life sentence." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have not been able to track the government's response to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, in any case, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with its late, unscrutinised, and illiberal amendments to the Firearms Act 1968, duly took full legal effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Paul Clarke enters the Police Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was with this statutory regime in place, of which he was clearly unaware, that Mr Clarke took a shotgun to the Police Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Clarke is perhaps not necessarily the most sympathetic character, though the test of a just legal system is how such figures are treated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had previously overturned on appeal a conviction regarding an attack &lt;a href="http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/golf/Man-accused-attacking-DVLA-inspector-broom-walks-free/article-361380-detail/article.html"&gt; on a DVLA inspector with a broomhandle&lt;/a&gt;. The news report of that case does suggest a certain implausibility to the account of Mr Clarke, but nevertheless his conviction was quashed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His solicitor has also volunteered in a radio interview that there was a previous incident involving a cattle prod. There may be other incidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is clear that Mr Clarke and the Police knew each other well. I understand that Mr Clarke may also be currently suing the Police in a civil action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also clear that Mr Clarke is a forthcoming member of his local community. A local paper &lt;a href="http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/news/Towns-new-county-wide-poor-list/article-762526-detail/article.html"&gt; report &lt;/a&gt;carries the following interview:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Paul Clarke, 26, of Nailsworth Crescent, Merstham, said: "Every area has a posher and a poorer end of town. If Merstham was in Lambeth, it would be the posh bit where the councillors live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I'd much prefer to live in Merstham to the centre of Reigate. At least we know our neighbours, and can knock on their door to borrow teabags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We may not all have a lot of money, but we have a lot more fun and people are friendlier.""&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Clarke telephoned the Police Station and asks for (and is put through to) Chief Superintendent Adrian Harper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps unwisely for someone about to appear with a shotgun and ammunition, Mr Clarke tells Chief Superintendent Harper:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I’ve got something to give you”.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This does rather evoke the similarly ambiguous "&lt;em&gt;let them have it&lt;/em&gt;" of Derek Bentley.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mr Clarke does turn up at the Police Station he is arrested and placed in the cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Mr Clarke's version of events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Clarke gave a statement to the Police. In this statement he says he found the shotgun and ammunition discarded in his garden two days previously and that he was handing the shotgun to the Police as his civic duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This statement was later read out in court.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of whether this story is plausible, it is important to note that this is the only version of events present in the now-initiated process. I understand that there has not been any evidence controverting this version considered at any stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although this version has not been tested by cross-examination, it has not been contradicted. Mr Clarke's testimony on this is the sole basis for the prosecution brought against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Guidance for Police in such a situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should the Police have done?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2002 (and thereby before the Criminal Justice Act 2003), the Home Office published &lt;a href="http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/HO-Firearms-Guidance.pdf"&gt; formal guidance to all Police Forces on how to deal with firearms offences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This guidance is still available on the Home Office site and presumably is still in force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 25.5 of this guidance provides sensible advice for Police Officers when someone turns up at a Police Station to surrender an illegal firearm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Anyone surrendering an illegally held firearm should be questioned discreetly with a view to establishing its history but, unless circumstances exist to give serious cause for concern as to its provenance (for example, if it appears to have been stolen), the person handing it in should not be pressed. The emphasis should be on creating an environment in which people hand in illegally held firearms."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I asked Surrey Police whether they could confirm whether there had been any regard to this guidance in arresting and charging Mr Clarke. Their press office provided me with the following statement:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A 27-year-old man, charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, has been found guilty at Guildford Crown Court and is awaiting sentence. It is inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage as we do not wish to influence sentencing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone who finds a sawn-off shotgun or a handgun should treat it as suspicious and as a potential crime scene, and report it to police immediately via the 999 system. A crime may have occurred and forensic opportunities need to be preserved."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it is still not known whether the Surrey Police had any regard to this important operational guidance when they decided to arrest Mr Clarke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, as we will now see, the Crown Prosecution Service is commendably more willing to comment, notwithstanding the issue of sentencing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The decision to prosecute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute. Such a decision should always be taken on the basis of the public interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the version of the facts provided by Mr Clarke is the only one at play here, the decision that the public interest required a prosecution seems in need of an explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is particularly so when the combination of a strict liability offence and a minimum custodial sentence means that the decision to prosecute is in effect a decision to impose criminal liability and at least a five year sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I now set out in full, so you can form your own view, the email exchange I had with the helpful press office at the Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JoK Question: &lt;br&gt;Please confirm whether the decision to prosecute was taken personally by the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Surrey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPS Answer: &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A District Crown Advocate in the Crown Prosecution Service in Surrey authorised Surrey Police to charge Paul Clarke. Each case is kept under constant review and following a further review of the case Portia Ragnauth, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Surrey, decided that it was still in the public interest to bring the case to court.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JoK Question: &lt;br&gt;Please tell me what you can about why the CPS decided to prosecute this case, especially as (a) the facts before the court (and not it seems controverted) would indicate such a prosecution was not in the public interest, and (b) the Home Office's relevant guidance states:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Anyone surrendering an illegally held firearm should be questioned discreetly with a view to establishing its history but, unless circumstances exist to give serious cause for concern as to its provenance (for example, if it appears to have been stolen), the person handing it in should not be pressed. The emphasis should be on creating an environment in which people hand in illegally held firearms"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPS Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Under the Code for Crown Prosecutors the CPS considered it was in the public interest to prosecute Mr Clarke as he was in possession of a sawn off shot gun. He had come into possession of the shot gun and two shotgun cartridges some days earlier and had not immediately contacted the police to make them aware of its existence. He was given the opportunity by the police to explain the full circumstances as to how he was in possession of the lethal weapon but his explanation lacked credibility. “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JoK Question:&lt;br&gt;Can you expressly confirm whether the CPS had any regard to the relevant Home Office guidance in their decision-making, in particular chapter 25.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPS Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"This Home Office guidance as indicated is operational guidance addressed to the police and is not guidance to CPS prosecutors on how to deal with cases involving firearms offences. Crown Prosecutors apply the Code for Code Prosecutors when considering whether or not they should prosecute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When making our decision we took into account that:&lt;br&gt;It’s a strict liability offence which means there is no defence to any possession.&lt;br&gt;It is a sawn off shot gun which is an aggravating feature. It carries a minimum of 5years imprisonment-mandatory-unless there are exceptional reasons. Our charging is quite clear because of the serious nature that these weapons can inflict, statute was passed to ensure that the possession reflected the serious nature hence 5 years imprisonment."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JoK Question: &lt;br&gt;On what basis was it decided that Mr Clarke's account lacked credibility?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPS Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Paul Clarke claimed that he found the shot gun in his garden and decided to bring it to the police station. Evidence showed that he was in possession of the gun and the cartridges for some days earlier and that at that time he did not try to contact the police, for them to collect the weapon. He could not explain why he waited some days before bringing the gun to the police station and why he did not contacted the police for them to come and collect the gun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The jury heard both the defence and prosecution case and reached the verdict that Paul Clarke was guilty of possession of a firearm."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jok Question:&lt;br&gt;Is it correct to say that the CPS did not have regard to that guidance? I should be most grateful for a simple yes/no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CPS Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The CPS did not have regard to the Home Office guidance as I explained it is guidance to police officers."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever the merits of the decision by the CPS to prosecute Mr Clarke, I think the press office at the CPS should be congratulated for providing these full answers in a matter of current controversy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The CPS's own guidance on when to prosecute is &lt;a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/firearms/#GENERAL_PRINCIPLES:_CHARGING"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the worrying aspect of this is that the decision to prosecute was based on what appears to be a subjective reaction to the only evidence available: Mr Clarke's own version of events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. The Court Hearing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court case did not last long. It started late one afternoon, and the verdict was given by the following lunchtime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prosecution called only one witness, the police officer (a Detective Sergeant) who made the arrest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, all the prosecution had to show was possession, and the arresting officer did indeed see Mr Clarke with the shotgun at the Police Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief Superintendant Harper was not called, and it is indeed in the public domain that he is &lt;a href="http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/ashtead/cops-suspended-alleged-dishonest-conduct/article-1016771-detail/article.html"&gt; currently suspended from duty in respect of an unrelated matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only other prosecution evidence were technical expert reports regarding the shotgun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shotgun was produced in court by the arresting officer, and it was shown to the jury by the court clerk. One observer recalls wondering if this made the court clerk also guilty of the possession offence for those moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shotgun also looked clean and not in the state of a weapon found in a garden. It is not known whether this was because it had been cleaned after its receipt by the Police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Clarke did not give oral evidence. He was fully entitled to do this, and it is the right of every defendant to force the prosecution to prove its case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He pleaded not guilty, probably in the hope that the jury would not convict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was also an application in open court, when the jury was not present, to strike the case out as an abuse of process, but this was refused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The judge summed up by stating this was an unusual case and that, as it was a strict liability, there could be no defence. However, he was careful not to direct the jury to convict: it was a matter for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The jury took twenty minutes to return a guilty verdict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What happens next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case has not finished. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court is still to pass sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may well be that the judge will find that there are exceptional circumstances to warrant not applying the mandatory minimum sentence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would be done either on the basis of Mr Clarke's statement (on which of course depended the CPS's decision to prosecute) or by Mr Clarke being orally examined (subject to Mr Clarke's consent) in court in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_hearing"&gt;Newton Hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Newton Hearings are when there is oral examination not to establish liability but to establish the gravity of an offence for the purpose of sentencing.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This case could still thereby conclude by Mr Clarke receiving an absolute or conditional discharge, or a suspended sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it is still possible that there will be a custodial sentence, even if for lesser a period than five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever the outcome, any injustice suffered by Paul Clarke will be the result of a strict liability offence, a misconceived and illiberal mandatory sentencing regime, the decisions to arrest and then charge, the decision to prosecute, the decision to not strike the case out, and the decision of the jury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And at no point so far has Mr Clarke's version of the facts been contested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am deeply grateful to the excellent &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/h_thompson"&gt; Holly Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, the journalist who originally broke the story at the &lt;a href="http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/news/Ex-soldier-faces-jail-handing-gun/article-1509082-detail/article.html"&gt; Surrey Mirror&lt;/a&gt; for her generosity in sharing her knowledge of the case. She attended the court for the hearing and kept a detailed shorthand note.

If I want to start a patient on a new medicine, the individual characteristics of the patient are important (Is the drug meant for their condition? Will it interact with other drugs they are on? Are they allergic to it? Can they tolerate it?) but at least as important is how the drug performs when used on large numbers of people.  This attenuates the large differences that can be seen among individuals, and allows us to predict how in general the drug will act.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the metrics we can use is something called the "number needed to treat/harm" (NNT).  This is a nice measure which is a bit more intuitive than other statistics.  For example, in the recently released &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm"&gt;USPSTF recommendations on mammography&lt;/a&gt;, it was reported that nearly 2000 women in their 40s needed to be screened to avert one breast cancer death (the number in the 60's age group was in the 300s).  Deciding what that means is a value judgement.  Is it worth it to screen so many for each life saved? Is it worth the pain of chasing down abnormal finding that are ultimately found to be benign?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/im_not_getting_a_flu_shot_beca.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/im_not_getting_a_flu_shot_beca.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/e6rDIjlGGns" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258661149263"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/a_contemptible_pseudoscientifi.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e289dcf033ce5cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Genetics"/><title type="html">A contemptible pseudoscientific scam</title><published>2009-11-19T19:31:51Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T19:31:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/op8o2sVy0LY/a_contemptible_pseudoscientifi.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/a_contemptible_pseudoscientifi.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grrr. I was sent a link to these lying, sleazebag scammers at &lt;a href="http://www.mychildtalentprofile.com/"&gt;mygeneprofile.com&lt;/a&gt;, and it's the kind of thing that pisses me off. What you'll find there is a long video where the lowlife in a suit talks about how your children have in-built genetic biases ("from God", no less), and how if you want them to be truly happy and successful, you should tailor their upbringing to maximize their genetic potential. And he blathers on about how they will do a genetic test to determine whether your child has genes for science or art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a complete lie. There is no such test. There can be no such test. That's not how genomes work, that they translate DNA in a comprehensible, measurable way into discrete traits for such abstract abilities as playing the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They claim that "The Industry is Featured by CNN, CBS News." I wonder what that means? That there were news reports about the human genome project? That they bought commercial time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's fraud.

This almost instantly triggered a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/17/time-to-refute-stephen-meyer/#comment-36257"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; from Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, saying, please, please, do precisely that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, so much for that idea. If this is what DI wants, this is not what DI is going to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much to say about Meyer’s “God of the Gaps” argument anyway, now applied to the origins of life just as it has previously been applied to the bacterial flagellum, the Cambrian explosion, and so on. Research is going on into the origins of life, but we have not yet solved the mystery. It just isn’t scientifically fruitful to invoke “intelligent design” in this context, as if it solves a problem, rather than just raising another one (who designed the super-complex designer, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do want to comment on one aspect of Meyer’s book that’s really jaw-dropping–albeit not in a strictly scientific area.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meyer is  trained as a historian and philosopher of science, not a biologist. So one would think he would know what his own field has to say about the relationship between science, religion, and naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet on the contrary, in &lt;em&gt;Signature in the Cell–&lt;/em&gt;and especially in Chapter 6, “The Origin of Science and the Possibility of Design”–he selectively uses historical science research to claim that modern science can still be infused with a sense of the divine. In the process, Meyer selectively ignores important developments from the 19th century and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As historians of science like Ronald Numbers have shown, after the Darwinian revolution, science became closely tied to methodological naturalism and a sense of fixed natural laws that are unchanging–and therefore capable of being studied in controlled experiments. In this context, appeals to miracles, divine intervention, intelligent design, and so on, were ruled out by practicing scientists, whether they were personally religious or not–for very good reason. They were seen as an inappropriate hinderance, and not based on testable data or inference. They were vague, and didn’t have any explanatory power. They might be religously satisfying, but as science, they were a cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, we have to go a bit closer into what Meyer is saying, as there is a grain of truth mixed into the sands of dubiousness. In citing early modern scientists like Kepler, Boyle, Newton, and so on, Meyer rightly notes that these pioneers felt that the order in the nature that they could detect was the work of an organizing intelligence–a great clockmaker for the clockwork universe. Therefore, science itself was, in a very strong sense, inquiry into the nature of the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Meyer asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;How could the act of invoking something so foundational to the history of science as the idea of design now completely violate the rules of science itself, as I had repeatedly heard many scientists assert? If belief in intelligent design first inspired modern scientific investigation, how could mere openness to the design hypothesis now act as a “science stopper” and threaten to put an end to productive scientific research altogether, as some scientists feared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Clearly, the idea of intelligent design had played a formative role in the foundation of modern science. Many great scientists had proposed specific design hypotheses. This seemed to suggest that intelligent design could function as a possible scientific hypothesis. But many contemporary scientists rejected this idea out of hand. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is obvious, and if Meyer is a historian of science, he should know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century especially–but it began even earlier–science differentiated itself from religion and decided that supernatural appeals were no longer testable or within the purview of science. Great battles were fought on this head, by the likes of John Tyndall, Thomas Henry Huxley, and many more. “The more we know of the fixed laws of nature, the more incredible do miracles become,” wrote Darwin in his &lt;em&gt;Autobiography&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, when lightning strikes, we no longer fear it is godly punishment. Rather, we know it is electricity. This is why, if patients’ symptoms improve after they pray or are prayed for, we know it is the placebo effect. Or at least, we know that is all that science can say about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meyer is right about how Kepler and Newton thought, but modern scientists have long since decided that they don’t work in the way Kepler, or Newton, or Paley did. Religious or otherwise, they leave claims about the supernatural out of what they do professionally, because there is no way to test such claims, or get other scientists to agree about them. For instance, you couldn’t convince an atheistic scientist, or even many Christian scientists, to accept the idea of supernatural design as a scientific, testable hypothesis. Science has left behind the supernatural for very sound methodological reasons; ID wants to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;But that just isn’t going to happen.&lt;/span&gt; Stronger distinctions have been built between science and religion as science advanced and professionalized, and that’s a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;thing. Vast progress has been made in this way; many pointless discussions have been avoided. There is no way that ID is going to pull science  back to the 17th century, and as a historian of science, Meyer ought to know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone does try to share the perspective of being a person of color or a woman in skeptic communities the majority of people in the groups I have encountered dismiss their viewpoint on extremely typical grounds. This &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/3966"&gt;article from richarddawkins.net&lt;/a&gt; has some really disturbing comments that illustrate exactly what I am getting at; an automatic opposition to the voices of people of color and women. Disagreeing isn't the problem here, it is the outright dismissal and unwillingness to ask questions in order to understand the point of view she puts forward here. Having an actual discussion, or an actual willingness to understand her and then disagreeing would be a very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a strange phenomenon. I don&amp;#39;t think the leaders of the atheist movement are consciously anti-feminist at all; it&amp;#39;s more a matter of being confident that equality is the right answer, appreciating everyone, male or female, working to promote rationalism in society, and then smugly assuming we&amp;#39;re done when we&amp;#39;re not. The Big Catches to bring in to an atheist meeting are people like Dawkins and Dennett and Hitchens — people who deserve their popularity and their reputations — but the women of atheism seem to be semi-invisible. Why aren&amp;#39;t we reaching out to, for instance, Susan Jacoby, and making her a more prominent face in atheism? She&amp;#39;s a wonderful writer, produced a book, &lt;i&gt;Freethinkers&lt;/i&gt;, that was part of the early wave of godless writings, and every time I've heard her speak, she says interesting and challenging things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't dismissal. It's casual disregard. It's being just enough pro-feminist that we lose sight of the real problems that women and people of color face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that would really help, I think, is if the grassroots spoke out a little bit more to remind us. Tell us who you want to hear who isn&amp;#39;t pale-skinned and full of testosterone; I&amp;#39;m not an organizer of meetings — I just get roped into these things — but one thing we noisy voices of atheism can do is name-drop when we get called, and ask if the inviting organization has considered X, Y, and Z for a lecture, too. So tell me in the comments: who are the deserving voices of the godless community who should be heard as much as the heterogametic ones who get all the press?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/the_problem_of_the_oblivious_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Ae6nvQZ08Lg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258658939142"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18415">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/358bc011935946de</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="Education"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Ray Comfort’s Miseducation Campaign Went Live Early</title><published>2009-11-19T19:00:31Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T19:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/19/ray-comforts-miseducation-campaign-went-live-early/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Ray Comfort has agreed to do an email interview for this site.  Please leave your questions in the comments and I’ll pass them along to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ray Comfort&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-of-todays-comments.html"&gt;lied&lt;/a&gt; about when he would be distributing his &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/18/ray-comfort-tries-to-sneak-creationism-into-on-the-origin-of-species/"&gt;anti-evolution version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; on college campuses.  He had said he would be doing the deed today.  But….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We had a change of plans. We went in on the 18th.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it pre-planned or a last-second change?  I don’t know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really shouldn’t have been a surprise since Comfort &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-11708-Philadelphia-Reason--Religion-Examiner~y2009m11d18-The-Origin-of-Species-Ray-Comfort-and-profound-ignorance#"&gt;distorts the truth for a living&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, copies of his book are out and we’ve learned quite a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems he (and his followers) appeared at number of campuses which were not on his original list of 50 schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The font size of Comfort’s section is far larger than Darwin’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs079.snc3/14648_176730214686_7427054686_2602788_4607471_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs079.snc3/14648_176730214686_7427054686_2602788_4607471_n.jpg" title="ComfortFont" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it significant?  Not necessarily, but there’s no reason you couldn’t have kept the same font size throughout.  The only reason I can think of to increase the font for Comfort’s section is so it stretches to 50+ pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort included several pictures in his section of the book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single picture that Darwin included in his original version of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; was omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;’s affiliates had planned counter-events to this campaign.  The date change meant some groups had to either revise their plans or hold their activities a day later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m particularly pleased with the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2886"&gt;SSA’s press release&lt;/a&gt; regarding this issue: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;We’re sorry that Mr. Comfort felt he had to mislead everyone just to avoid the counter-efforts of our campus groups,” said August Brunsman, Executive Director of the Secular Student Alliance.  “Apparently he thought his deception would only work if nobody was around to tell the truth&lt;/strong&gt;”… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to prevent the ministry from tricking college students, the Secular Student Alliance national office assisted affiliated college groups to schedule protests, host speakers, write letters to the editor, show films, and distribute the original version of Darwin’s 150-year old masterpiece.  Their plans will go forward despite Comfort’s sudden, unexplained change of dates.  The Secular Student Alliance has collected resources to counter Living Waters’ efforts at &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/originintoschools"&gt;http://www.secularstudents.org/originintoschools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The best way to defeat misinformation is with education&lt;/strong&gt;,” said Brunsman.  “&lt;strong&gt;We would have loved to have a peaceful exchange of ideas with the ministry, but we’ll settle for having the last word in students’ minds&lt;/strong&gt;.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofthestars.blogspot.com/2009/11/ray-comforts-book-is-immoral.html"&gt;Atticus Hannah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, found ways to pick up several copies of the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I set out to do all I could to keep this immorality away from youngling college students. So I put on my hat, grabbed two bags, tossed on a sweatshirt and headed out to the Ray Comfort people handing out free books at the U. I walked past the first group of people and got a book. I walked past the second group, got a book. I walked past the third group, got a book. Fourth group, book. Fifth, book. Then I doubled around, took off my sweatshirt and hat, and repeated… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away with 22 books. One of which is actually for one of my roommates, one of which is for me. Stitch, in the picture, is posing with all 22 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_GLfpTwPkB9U/SwS3RKP-lwI/AAAAAAAAACQ/jT3ujUaLgLA/s1600/PB180916.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_GLfpTwPkB9U/SwS3RKP-lwI/AAAAAAAAACQ/jT3ujUaLgLA/s1600/PB180916.JPG" title="ComfortBook" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even some &lt;a href="http://thomas2026.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/congrats-ray-comfort-you-have-earned-a-lifetime-achievement-attie/"&gt;Christians are embarrassed by Comfort&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, congrats to you Ray Comfort. You have truly surpassed all previous Attie award winners. You have publically slandered a man (Darwin), you have made all Christians look like ignorant boobs, and worst of all, you have caused people to question the validity of Christ through your dishonesty. You were in the zone today, my friend.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just &lt;a href="http://bruinskeptics.org/2009/11/18/a-day-early-banana-man-and-kirk-cameron/"&gt;creeps me out&lt;/a&gt;… (with &lt;strong&gt;Spencer Fern&lt;/strong&gt;, secretary of the [UCLA] Bruin Alliance of Skeptics and Secularists secretary).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other thoughts?&lt;br&gt;

However, thanks to the NCSE and other bloggers, hopefully the scientific and educational communities will sit up and take notice of the blatant distortions and misrepresentations going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he's in dialogue with a proper scientist, then there's much less room to maneuver. Especially in print, as Gish Gallops are much harder to do when there's a paper trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I highly recommend reading the full 4-part exchange between Scott &amp;amp; Comfort. Remember, this is Rays chance to shine, or at least redeem himself. I&amp;#39;m just sorry that Kirk Cameron, famous for being the first Muppet to be created with human skin, doesn&amp;#39;t contribute his intellectual force to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/29/exclusive-ray-comfort-defends-his-creationist-edition-of-on-the-origin-of-species.html"&gt;Part 1 &lt;/a&gt;(Ray Comfort defends...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/30/how-creationist-origin-distorts-darwin.html"&gt;Part 2 &lt;/a&gt;(How Creationist 'Origin' Distorts Darwin)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/11/02/ray-comfort-responds-to-genie-scott-on-creationist-origin-of-species.html"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; (Ray Comfort Responds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/11/03/scientist-genie-scotts-last-word-to-creationist-ray-comfort-there-you-go-again.html"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; (Scott: There you go again...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you go into print against a heavyweight in the scientific community - you're going to pull out the big guns. Those unassailable arguments, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, make up your own mind whether Comfort succeeds. But I'm pretty sure if those are the best arguments he's got, then he's in no position to criticise evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I am (as Professor Dawkins says) "an ignorant fool," why are so many feeling threatened by what I've written? Surely, the Introduction will be ignorance and foolishness, and simply confirm the students' presuppositions that intelligent design isn't worthy of even a first look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing, Ray. ID has been shown to be one big Argument from Personal Ignorance; it has been repeatedly demonstrated in legal cases and debates in the past 20-or-so years to hold no position in science or education. As watered-down Creationism, it&amp;#39;s just a disingenuous attempt to sneak partisan belief into impartial science education. And remember, your introduction, full of ignorance &amp;amp; foolishness, doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily &amp;quot;confirm the students&amp;#39; presuppositions&amp;quot;. Not every idea is worthy of a platform; how much time in a proper educational establishment would we waste going over &lt;em&gt;every single &lt;/em&gt;preposterous and self-indulgent crackpot notion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ray quotes Darwin, it may be worth keeping TalkOrigins open at the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html"&gt;Quote Mine project page&lt;/a&gt;. Ray does this frequently with Newton &amp;amp; Einstein as well (others do so with Dawkins&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Blind Watchmaker&amp;quot;), rejecting their science but happily quote mining anything that even tenuously supports his position, however dishonestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's also fond of Strawmen arguments. Like, oh I don't know, this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Introduction also defines an atheist as someone who believes that nothing created everything—which is a scientific impossibility. Professor Dawkins believes that nothing created everything, and his belief is a big intellectual embarrassment to his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAY I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH IS INCORRECT ABOUT THESE SENTENCES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;a href="http://www.motivatedphotos.com/?id=27658"&gt;Skeptical Hippo&lt;/a&gt; can help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.motivatedphotos.com/?id=27658"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://pix.motivatedphotos.com/2009/7/5/633824049006071090-SkepticalHippo-t2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Much more succinct. Thanks, Skeptical Hippo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no species-to-species transitional forms in the fossil record. None. I deal with hundreds of atheists every day through my blog, so I can predict the response: "Of course there are fossils! There are millions of fossils, you unscientific idiot!!" They are right. There are millions of fossils, but they are the fossils of God's creation and have nothing to do with evolution. Again, there are no species-to-species transitional forms in the fossil record. That's what is called "the missing link."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is roughly equivalent to saying that footprints don't prove that someone walked in a certain direction. You could fill in every single space between the prints, and there'd still be some gap. It's Zeno's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#The_dichotomy_paradox"&gt;Dichotomy paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fine, you don't even need fossils to discuss evolution, because science discovered something interesting called DNA just over 50 years ago. Probably a bit too recent to be noticed by the Creationist intellectual elite, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Darwin to Dawkins, they speak the language of speculation, continually using words like &lt;em&gt;probably, maybe, perhaps,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, damn scientific uncertainty. If only they were so confident, then we'd believe them. You have no idea how education works, Ray, none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, again, I'm an Arts graduate. It takes me a bit longer to grasp scientific concepts than actual scientists, but I persevere and give it a good shot. So for Ray to continually make the same ridiculous pronouncements is quite frustrating. Such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, evolution has no explanation as to why and how around 1.4 million species of animals&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;evolved as male and female. No one even goes near explaining how and why each species managed to reproduce (during the millions of years the female was supposedly evolving to maturity) without the right reproductive machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reasoning  can be (sort of) explained in the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor does any evolutionary believer adequately address the fact that all those 1.4 million species managed to evolve into maturity together in our lifetime. Nothing we have in creation is half evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Half evolved'? From whose standpoint, Ray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only works if you view the whole of life as a miraculous creation, perfectly formed. But even a basic thought towards common ancestry and descent with modification would show why this is wrong. Nature may not be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam_A.H.H.#Nature.2C_red_in_tooth_and_claw"&gt;red in tooth and claw&lt;/a&gt;, but it still is far from perfect. Just because you can't think of a better-adapted trait doesn't mean that there isn't one. I would place money on Ray's image of evolution being literally half an eye, bisected at the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not only do we see this mature completion in creation; we see it displayed in the fossil record. It reveals that each animal was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Ray, if we took as glib a look at the fossil record as you do, we'd surmise that each animal was born without skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the whole exchange, Eugenie Scott has some great responses. But, as I said in &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/794"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, of all the people up to the level of discourse as Scott, Comfort is very far down the list. And I haven't even mentioned Godwin's Law yet. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>JohnGregson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258655900859"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-6217199065557967411">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8854c7037a625ff7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Are We Surprised at Huffington Post Anymore?</title><published>2009-11-19T17:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T17:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-we-surprised-at-huffington-post.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Over at http://www.welovequacks.com/retard (aka the Huffington Post), they've put up a list of 10 "game changers".  People who are on the cutting edge and are making us rethink how we do things.  They delve into many areas like business, style, politics, and, of course, wellness.  Take a guess who they selected as their "game changer" for the last topic.

The guy who inspired an epic smack down from the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2116"&gt;Science Based Medicine blog&lt;/a&gt;.

Yep, well, "evangelist" is appropriate as he's all about the dogma and stupidity rather than science. FuffHo says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether or not you agree with his point of view, there is no question that Mercola has helped inspire the explosion of online interest in integrative medicine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Great, thanks, asshole.  No, I don't agree with your point of view because it is demonstrably wrong and air-headed and stupid and, did I mention demonstrably wrong?  "Integrative" medicine is the next in a line of adjectives describing shit that is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; medicine.  It doesn't matter if it's "alternative" or "integrative" or "complementary" - if it works reliably and you can depend on actual measurable outcomes from the treatment or therapy, then it's just &lt;i&gt;medicine&lt;/i&gt;.  Any descriptive word beforehand should make a consumer weary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially if he's Mercola and describing the staggering lack of medical knowledge displayed in the SBM post linked to above.

Most people I have met know very little of the adaptive immune system, and if you ask a random person on the street about the innate immune system, well, don’t, it’s depressing. So I’m going to start off with a brief introduction into innate immunity. It is a bit of a simplification, and if you want to know more, buy an immunology book, I recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081533642X/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two types of immunity which do, somewhat, overlap. The innate immune system has several parts. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"&gt;Complement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"&gt;granulocytes&lt;/a&gt; (I include &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"&gt;Mast Cells&lt;/a&gt; here, too), and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"&gt;Natural Killer cells&lt;/a&gt; (NK cells) are the portions which are truly innate requiring no antibodies to the target proteins or cells, although bound antibodies can and do enhance these responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NK cells destroy non-self tissue (and are potentially, along with CD8+ T cells, a major component of immune system mediated transplant rejection) when they fail to bind an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"&gt;MHC class I&lt;/a&gt; molecule which is normally a result of viral &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"&gt;downregulation&lt;/a&gt; of the MHC class I gene. As opposed to CD8+ T-cell cytolitic activity which is in the default “do not kill” state, the “default” state for an NK cell is “kill” unless it is given the “stop” signal by binding MHC class I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complement system is initiated in one of three pathways, Classical, Alternative, or Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL). Classical is actually part of the adaptive immune system as it requires antibodies to bind antigen (IgG or IgM antibodies, specifically) and a protein called C1q binds to the Fc (functional) region of the antibodies (IgG or IgM) which are bound to the antigen. The alternative pathway is started by random dissociation of a molecule (C3) into it’s two byproducts. The MBL pathway, as the name suggests, binds mannose (and fucose) in a specific arrangement as found on many pathogenic cells rather than binding to antibodies which are attached to antigen. You really only need to know two things about this: C3b and Membrane Attack Complex (MAC). C3b is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsonin"&gt;opsonizing&lt;/a&gt; agent (it coats the target cell and signals to phagocytes “EAT ME!!!”) while the MAC forms a pore allowing all the insides of the cell to diffuse to the outside as well as the other way around, thus killing the target cell. I see no need to get much more detailed than this with the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final major parts of the innate immune system are the cells. These include the granulocytic and phagocytic cells. Neutrophils are both, but mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes, as while the macrophages is phagocytic. Eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, and mast cells contain granules (hence the name: granulocyte) which contain chemicals utilized for destruction of target cells and recruitment of additional cells. Macrophages and neutrophils are capable of phagocytizing pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system responds the same way to the same type of pathogen every time. One &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; infection is treated just like any other, at least by the innate immune system, until the adaptive response enhances and directs the parts of the innate response..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptive immune system has two major components which need to be remembered: T-cells and B cells. Each of these can be subdivided, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"&gt;CD8+&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cells"&gt;CD4+&lt;/a&gt; T cells (as well as γδ T cells and others, but let’s ignore these) and Plasma, Memory, Follicular, and other B cells. Put simply, T-cells play a role in cell-mediated immunity while B-cells produce antibodies. When you or I receive a vaccine, these are the types of cells which are being activated. I say activated because (short of a genetic disorder or cancer treatment) you have thousands of each type of cell which vary considerably in the antigen they bind to. When these cells bind the antigen, they proliferate (and undergo hypermutation (lots of mutations in the binding region of the immunoglobulin), and then activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD8+ T-cells interact with MHC class I molecules and the peptide which is presented by the MHC molecule. The peptide which is bound by the MHC molecule is the antigen which is presented to T-cells. If the (CD8+) T cell (presently naive) is capable of tightly binding the MHC and peptide, it undergoes clonal expansion, i.e. it will proliferate several thousand fold, and these daughter cells are “activated.” Once activated, the same MHC class I/peptide combination results in the T-cell killing the target cell. CD4+ T cells, on the other hand, respond to MHC Class II molecules and only signal other cells when it binds its target MHC/Peptide combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-cells produce the immunoglobulins which are found on the surface of B-cells (IgD, IgM), in mucosal areas (IgA), and serum (all of the above plus IgE and IgG). Different immunoglobulans have different Fc regions which elicit various responses. IgE is responsible for the degranulation of Mast Cells. IgG and IgM activate the complement system and opsonize pathogens. IgA prevents pathogens from colonizing mucosal areas. In truth, their roles and interactions are a bit more complex than this, but for the purposes of an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the immune system, it will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Texans: Are you really married? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Barbara Ann Radnofsky, a Houston lawyer and Democratic candidate for attorney general, says that a 22-word clause in a 2005 constitutional amendment designed to ban gay marriages erroneously endangers the legal status of all marriages in the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… [T]he troublemaking phrase, as Radnofsky sees it, is Subsection B, which declares:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Architects of the amendment included the clause to ban same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships. But Radnofsky, who was a member of the powerhouse Vinson &amp;amp; Elkins law firm in Houston for 27 years until retiring in 2006, says the wording of Subsection B effectively &amp;quot;eliminates marriage in Texas,&amp;quot; including common-law marriages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texans who read Language Log were apprised of this danger back in 2005, when I asked "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002617.html"&gt;Is marriage identical or similar to itself?&lt;/a&gt;" (11/2/2005). Actually, many others (mostly opponents of the amendment) noted this problem back then as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment's backers are not concerned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A conservative leader whose organization helped draft the amendment dismissed Radnofsky’s position, saying it was similar to scare tactics opponents unsuccessfully used against the proposal in 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"It’s a silly argument," said Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Legal Institute in Plano. Any lawsuit based on the wording of Subsection B, he said, would have "about one chance in a trillion" of being successful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Radnofsky's goal, of course, is to embarrass her opponent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;She calls it a "massive mistake" and blames the current attorney general, Republican Greg Abbott, for allowing the language to become part of the Texas Constitution. Radnofsky called on Abbott to acknowledge the wording as an error and consider an apology. She also said that another constitutional amendment may be necessary to reverse the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in 2005, this seems to be an interesting case for theories of legal interpretation, since on one hand, the intent of the drafters and supporters of the amendment is clear; but on the other hand, as Ms. Radnofsky says, "You do not have to have a fancy law degree to read this and understand what it plainly says."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002603.html"&gt;Antonin Scalia's theory of meaning&lt;/a&gt;,  for example (about which more &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002694.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002616.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), he would conclude that the state of marriage does not now exist in the state of Texas, at least if this amendment passes constitutional muster.&lt;/p&gt;

This. Out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbulb.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/mandelbulb.jpg" alt="mandelbulb" title="mandelbulb" width="610" height="596"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that’s an alien spore, or a crystal of some kind. But it’s actually what appears to be &lt;a href="http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbulb.html"&gt;a rendering of a three-dimensional fractal&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal"&gt;Fractals&lt;/a&gt; are very interesting. There are different ways to describe one, but one way to think of one is that it’s a shape that looks the same no matter what magnification you use. You can double it, triple it, make it 10,876,432 times bigger, and the object still displays (more or less) the same features. The term &lt;em&gt;fractal&lt;/em&gt; was coined by Benoît Mandelbrot, and there is an entire subclass of fractals named after him. They are seen in nature (and art, like &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larrycarlson/2932178510/in/set-72157607114867658/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) quite a bit. Coastlines are fractal, as are — seriously — some kinds of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, fractals are generally calculated in two dimensions. What’s new here is that the fractal pattern has now been calculated in &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; dimensions! That is, to say the least, a non-trivial procedure — I used to play with some of the 2D equations many years ago, on my old 512k Fat Mac, with code written in Pascal (yes, with the semicolons and everything) and it was fascinating if very complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the 3D idea has been written up by &lt;a href="http://www.skytopia.com/profile/profile.html"&gt;Daniel White&lt;/a&gt;, who, along with others, figured out how to create and render such an incredible object. He even created &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqkPjpU6bsA"&gt;a &amp;quot;fly-over&amp;quot; video&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate the fractal pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Even if the math of this makes no sense at all to you, the beauty of this should be apparent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings up a point: why are mathematical shapes beautiful? What makes them so pleasing to our eyes and brain; why did we evolve an appreciation for such things? I don’t know, and at some point I’ll have to research that a bit — understanding the principles behind this will help me appreciate it even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you may not know is that on Friday, 27th November, before the convention starts – there’s going to be a book launch! Dr Martin Bridgstock, who appears on &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=525034#"&gt;Skeptic Zone episode #47&lt;/a&gt; at Dragon*Con, has got a new book out via Cambridge University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cup.es/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521758932&amp;amp;ss=fro"&gt;Beyond Belief – Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‘ is an evidence-based approach to the paranormal, drawing upon various studies and investigations (including the 2008 Australian research mentioned in the podcast) to promote critical thinking skills and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whether ghosts, astrology or ESP, up to 80 per cent of the population believes in one or more aspects of the paranormal. Such beliefs are entertaining, and it is tempting to think of them as harmless. However, there is mounting evidence that paranormal beliefs can be dangerous – cases of children dying because parents favoured alternative remedies over conventional medicine, and ‘psychics’ who trade on the grief of the bereaved for personal profit and gain. Expenditure on the paranormal runs into billions of dollars each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the introduction points out, this book has something new to say about modern skepticism, its ethical underpinnings and how it is practiced – particularly noteworthy is how this expands upon ideas and issues previously discussed in articles by Dr Bridgstock, published in the likes of the Skeptical Inquirer (’&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skeptical_ethicsmdash_what_should_we_investigate"&gt;Skeptical Ethics— What Should We Investigate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘) and the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/publications/magazine/"&gt;Australian Skeptic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a lecture that Dr Bridgstock presented in 2004 on teaching with a skeptical approach at the university level:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D5965225797333269996%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=100&amp;amp;height=100" width="100" height="100"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I’m in the index because I’m mentioned on page 4 as a co-researcher, which is the first time anything like that has happened, so I’m running around the house going ‘&lt;em&gt;WAHHHHHH!!!!&lt;/em&gt;‘ at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roxanne Westover&lt;/strong&gt;, a 17-year-old from Ohio, &lt;a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/19/student-gives-reasons-for-not-standing-during/?newswatch"&gt;stopped standing for the Pledge of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; after learning in her history class that she didn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I’m an atheist, and I believe the pledge isn’t something toward our nation,” she said. “It’s more like a religious oath, and I believe that if I stand I’m still participating in it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times, she was “written up and send to the principal’s office” for not following suit and pledging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU contacted the school and did their thing.  As a result, it looks like there will be no further punishment for Roxanne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Westover said she encourages others with similar beliefs to stand up for them by sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do encourage students to not stand up and to stand up for what they believe in,” she said. “Even throughout the whole entire thing, I had a lot of people backing me up who felt the same way about it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad she has support — a lot of students don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxanne added that her refusal to stand for the pledge had nothing to do with &lt;strong&gt;Will Phillips&lt;/strong&gt;, but she supports what he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://dashes.com/anil/" title=""&gt;pioneer blogger&lt;/a&gt; (and of course &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash" title=""&gt;twitterer&lt;/a&gt;) and one of the founders of &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/" title=""&gt;Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;, the company that built blogging platforms including MoveableType (which is used by Scienceblogs.com) and Typepad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, he made an official announcement that he will be leading &lt;a href="http://expertlabs.org/" title=""&gt;Expert Labs&lt;/a&gt; (also on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/expertlabs" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) which is a new project (largely run/funded by &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/" title=""&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;) to facilitate feedback by the experts (including scientists, of course) to the Obama Administration and other government officials. Read the &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/1118expert_labs.shtml" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.observer.com/2009/media/dash-dc-tech-guru-will-head-govt-incubator-digitize-democracy" title=""&gt;early media coverage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/11/anil-dash-crowdsources-social-networks-to-inform-public-policy/" title=""&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; is much better) , an &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1118expert_labs_anil_transcript.pdf" title=""&gt;interview with Anil (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2009/media/1118expert_labs_interview.shtml" title=""&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, Anil got this job due to writing &lt;a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/the-most-interesting-new-tech-startup-of-2009.html" title=""&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; stating that the executive branch of the federal government of the United States was the "Most Interesting New Tech Startup of 2009". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ScienceOnline2010, Anil will run the session &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Government_2.0/" title=""&gt;Government 2.0&lt;/a&gt; the main purpose of which is for him to get feedback from the leaders of the science and Web community on how to make Expert Labs work the best it possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lindsey Hoshaw&lt;/b&gt; is a freelance journalist and a recent &lt;a href="http://journalism.stanford.edu/" title=""&gt;journalism graduate from Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. She has stirred quite a lot of passion in the world of journalism recently by being one of the first and probably best known products of 'crowdsourced journalism' - she made a &lt;a href="http://spot.us/pitches/238" title=""&gt;pitch at Spot.us&lt;/a&gt; and it was successful - she &lt;a href="http://spot.us/stories/252-dissecting-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch" title=""&gt;collected sufficient funds&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Garbage-Girl/106503016241" title=""&gt;Facebook fan page&lt;/a&gt; helped there as well) to go on a reporting trip on a research ship to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch" title=""&gt;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&lt;/a&gt;. She reported from the voyage on &lt;a href="http://lindseyhoshaw.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt; and via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thegarbagegirl" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (also her &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindseyhoshaw" title=""&gt;personal account&lt;/a&gt;). I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/talkin_trash.php" title=""&gt;blogged about this&lt;/a&gt; before the trip started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short summary article by Lindsey was then published in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html" title=""&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (which, while making no promises, was interested in the story from the start). That article (and especially in comparison to her blogging) was greeted by quite a lot of commentary, some by media watchers and journalists, some by scientists. See the reactions, for example, by &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/trash_compactor.php?page=all" title=""&gt;Megan Garber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/" title=""&gt;Miriam Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2009/11/12/thoughts-on-trash-talk/" title=""&gt;John Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/767" title=""&gt;Martin Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2009/11/11/when-a-blog-beats-a-nyt-story/" title=""&gt;Mathew Ingram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/13/about-that-garbage-patch/" title=""&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/17/which-is-better-for-science-inaccurate-media-coverage-or-no-coverage-at-all/" title=""&gt;Sheril again&lt;/a&gt; - read the comment thread).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voyage, and the reporting from it (both on traditional and modern media platforms), brought into light the differences between the goals, needs, methods and ethics of journalists and those of scientists. What those differences are, and how they can be surmounted so scientists and journalists can work together and each do a better job, will be the topic of the session that Lindsay will be co-moderating - &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Talking_Trash/" title=""&gt;Talking Trash&lt;/a&gt; - which promises to be quite exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ben MacNeill&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.trixieupdate.com/about/" title=""&gt;a designer&lt;/a&gt; here in Chapel Hill. I first met Ben at the 2005 BloggerCon at UNC. When his daughter Trixie was born he started a blog, &lt;a href="http://www.trixieupdate.com/" title=""&gt;Trixie Update&lt;/a&gt;, on which he &lt;a href="http://www.trixieupdate.com/trixie-update-101/" title=""&gt;recorded and graphed everything&lt;/a&gt; he could think of about his daughter's daily patterns: when she slept, ate, had a diaper change, etc. I commented on this, from a perspective of a chronobiologist, in an old &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/development_of_the_human_sleep.php" title=""&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the development and consolidation of circadian rhythms and sleep patterns in human infants. Trixie is far too old to have diapers changed any more, but the setup continues. Ben has developed the software further and is now offering it as an iPhone (or Web) application - the &lt;a href="http://www.trixietracker.com/" title=""&gt;Trixie Tracker&lt;/a&gt; which you can use, if you are a new parent, to track everything you want about your baby (and perhaps detect early if something suddenly changes and perhaps requires medical attention). Ben is also on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chillnc" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Ben will do a demo of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Trixie_Tracker/" title=""&gt;Data-driven parenting - Trixie Tracker&lt;/a&gt; and co-moderate the session on &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Citizen_Science/" title=""&gt;Citizen Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007903" title=""&gt;The Astronomical Orientation of Ancient Greek Temples&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite its appearing to be a simple question to answer, there has been no consensus as to whether or not the alignments of ancient Greek temples reflect astronomical intentions. Here I present the results of a survey of archaic and classical Greek temples in Sicily and compare them with temples in Greece. Using a binomial test I show strong evidence that there is a preference for solar orientations. I then speculate that differences in alignment patterns between Sicily and Greece reflect differing pressures in the expression of ethnic identity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007974" title=""&gt;Distributed Network, Wireless and Cloud Computing Enabled 3-D Ultrasound; a New Medical Technology Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medical technologies are indispensable to modern medicine. However, they have become exceedingly expensive and complex and are not available to the economically disadvantaged majority of the world population in underdeveloped as well as developed parts of the world. For example, according to the World Health Organization about two thirds of the world population does not have access to medical imaging. In this paper we introduce a new medical technology paradigm centered on wireless technology and cloud computing that was designed to overcome the problems of increasing health technology costs. We demonstrate the value of the concept with an example; the design of a wireless, distributed network and central (cloud) computing enabled three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound system. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of producing a 3-D high end ultrasound scan at a central computing facility using the raw data acquired at the remote patient site with an inexpensive low end ultrasound transducer designed for 2-D, through a mobile device and wireless connection link between them. Producing high-end 3D ultrasound images with simple low-end transducers reduces the cost of imaging by orders of magnitude. It also removes the requirement of having a highly trained imaging expert at the patient site, since the need for hand-eye coordination and the ability to reconstruct a 3-D mental image from 2-D scans, which is a necessity for high quality ultrasound imaging, is eliminated. This could enable relatively untrained medical workers in developing nations to administer imaging and a more accurate diagnosis, effectively saving the lives of people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007910" title=""&gt;Generation and Characterization of Fmr1 Knockout Zebrafish&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common known causes of inherited mental retardation. The gene mutated in FXS is named FMR1, and is well conserved from human to Drosophila. In order to generate a genetic tool to study FMR1 function during vertebrate development, we generated two mutant alleles of the fmr1 gene in zebrafish. Both alleles produce no detectable Fmr protein, and produce viable and fertile progeny with lack of obvious phenotypic features. This is in sharp contrast to published results based on morpholino mediated knock-down of fmr1, reporting defects in craniofacial development and neuronal branching in embryos. These phenotypes we specifically addressed in our knock-out animals, revealing no significant deviations from wild-type animals, suggesting that the published morpholino based fmr1 phenotypes are potential experimental artifacts. Therefore, their relation to fmr1 biology is questionable and morpholino induced fmr1 phenotypes should be avoided in screens for potential drugs suitable for the treatment of FXS. Importantly, a true genetic zebrafish model is now available which can be used to study FXS and to derive potential drugs for FXS treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007924" title=""&gt;Emotional Modulation of Attention: Fear Increases but Disgust Reduces the Attentional Blink&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well known that facial expressions represent important social cues. In humans expressing facial emotion, fear may be configured to maximize sensory exposure (e.g., increases visual input) whereas disgust can reduce sensory exposure (e.g., decreases visual input). To investigate whether such effects also extend to the attentional system, we used the "attentional blink" (AB) paradigm. Many studies have documented that the second target (T2) of a pair is typically missed when presented within a time window of about 200-500 ms from the first to-be-detected target (T1; i.e., the AB effect). It has recently been proposed that the AB effect depends on the efficiency of a gating system which facilitates the entrance of relevant input into working memory, while inhibiting irrelevant input. Following the inhibitory response on post T1 distractors, prolonged inhibition of the subsequent T2 is observed. In the present study, we hypothesized that processing facial expressions of emotion would influence this attentional gating. Fearful faces would increase but disgust faces would decrease inhibition of the second target. We showed that processing fearful versus disgust faces has different effects on these attentional processes. We found that processing fear faces impaired the detection of T2 to a greater extent than did the processing disgust faces. This finding implies emotion-specific modulation of attention. Based on the recent literature on attention, our finding suggests that processing fear-related stimuli exerts greater inhibitory responses on distractors relative to processing disgust-related stimuli. This finding is of particular interest for researchers examining the influence of emotional processing on attention and memory in both clinical and normal populations. For example, future research could extend upon the current study to examine whether inhibitory processes invoked by fear-related stimuli may be the mechanism underlying the enhanced learning of fear-related stimuli.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007896" title=""&gt;Synergy between Repellents and Organophosphates on Bed Nets: Efficacy and Behavioural Response of Natural Free-Flying An. gambiae Mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chemicals are used on bed nets in order to prevent infected bites and to kill aggressive malaria vectors. Because pyrethroid resistance has become widespread in the main malaria vectors, research for alternative active ingredients becomes urgent. Mixing a repellent and a non-pyrethroid insecticide seemed to be a promising tool as mixtures in the laboratory showed the same features as pyrethroids. We present here the results of two trials run against free-flying Anopheles gambiae populations comparing the effects of two insect repellents (either DEET or KBR 3023, also known as icaridin) and an organophosphate insecticide at low-doses (pirimiphos-methyl, PM) used alone and in combination on bed nets. We showed that mixtures of PM and the repellents induced higher exophily, blood feeding inhibition and mortality among wild susceptible and resistant malaria vectors than compounds used alone. Nevertheless the synergistic interactions are only involved in the high mortality induced by the two mixtures. These field trials argue in favour of the strategy of mixing repellent and organophosphate on bed nets to better control resistant malaria vectors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007975" title=""&gt;Survival and Cardioprotective Benefits of Long-Term Blueberry Enriched Diet in Dilated Cardiomyopathy Following Myocardial Infarction in Rats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite remarkable progress in treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) over the last two decades, mortality, personal suffering and cost remain staggering, and effective interventions are still a challenge. Previously we reported that a blueberry-enriched diet (BD) attenuated necroapoptosis and inflammation in periinfarct area in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). To test the hypothesis that BD will attenuate the course of CHF, including mortality and cardiac remodeling during the first year after induction of MI in rats. Two weeks after coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into two groups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and then12-mo dietary regimens were initiated as follows: ad libitum regular diet (control, CD, n = 27) and isocaloric food with 2% blueberry supplement (BD, n = 27) also available ad libitum. These dietary groups were compared to each other and to sham group (SH). Mortality over the 12 mo was reduced by 22% in BD compared with CD (p&amp;lt;0.01). In the course of developing CHF, BD had no effect on the body weight, heart rate or blood pressure. Bi-monthly Echo revealed significant attenuation of the LV chamber remodeling, LV posterior wall thinning, and MI expansion in BD compared with CD. In fact, BD arrested the MI expansion. This is the first experimental evidence that a blueberry-enriched diet has positive effects on the course of CHF and thus warrants consideration for clinical evaluation.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_216.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Unw1nlScbgk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258648763228"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/positive_exposure_and_the_face.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0896ee331dc048f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stuff You Send Me"/><title type="html">Positive Exposure and the Faces of What We Study</title><published>2009-11-19T15:45:27Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T15:45:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/vTIgR8YlpRM/positive_exposure_and_the_face.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/positive_exposure_and_the_face.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a lecture to write this morning, so I thought I would present something one of you sent me. Loyal worshiper Rula writes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello goddess,
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of fall, I offer up a &lt;a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3054134/0~2376778~2372808~6007659~6007676"&gt;boot.&lt;/a&gt;  I know they&amp;#39;re flats but I think they&amp;#39;re beautiful. And &lt;a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3031158?refsid=270479&amp;amp;refcat=0~2376778~2372808~2381853~2381959&amp;amp;SourceID=1&amp;amp;SlotID=2&amp;amp;origin=related&amp;amp;cm_Sp=Related-Items-_-Product-_-Manual"&gt;this has a really pretty classic look &lt;/a&gt;to it. I adore Via Spiga. Also Frye...if only I didn't already have a gazillion dollars in med school loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyways. The real reason I'm emailing is that I recently saw a presentation from Rick Guidotti, a former fashion photographer who now runs an organization called Positive Exposure. His presentation moved most of my classmates to tears, in a good way. Reading your blog today, I realized it might be something that would interest you, if you hadn't already heard of it. I think his website speaks for itself (&lt;a href="http://www.positiveexposure.org/home.html),"&gt;http://www.positiveexposure.org/home.html), &lt;/a&gt;but essentially he takes pictures of people with various genetic conditions to show that difference is beautiful, rather than shameful. He's involved in activism in Tanzinia to prevent the murder of albinos, and is working to create a database for medical professionals with pictures and testimonials from people living with genetic diseases (to serve as a counterpoint to the dehumanizing images and descriptions available in most medical texts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the real message behind this project is one of anti-stigma, I thought you might be intrigued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shoes are lovely, but the pictures are truly rem,arkable. If you've got a few minutes to spare today, go check them out. They are a sobering and motivating reminder that the conditions that many of us study in the isolation of our laboratories have human faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the great finds, Rula!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/positive_exposure_and_the_face.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/vTIgR8YlpRM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258648315897"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8228/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e89454a2c2dc5f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Large Hadron Collider Ready to Restart</title><published>2009-11-19T16:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T16:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8228/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists have repaired the world's largest atom smasher and plan by this weekend to restart the fault-ridden Large Hadron Collider.

In 2003 scientists discovered a fairly complete skeleton (skull, jaw, pelvis, arms, legs, hands and feet) on the island of Flores in Indonesia. The skeleton is 18,000 years old and is probably an adult female about 3 feet 6 inches in height and with a brain capacity of 417 cc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other specimens of H. floresiensis, but none with cranial parts. The type specimen described above, designated LB1, is the only good specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a controversy surrounding how to interpret this fossil. In one camp are those who claim it is a modern human with dwarfism and microcephaly – a developmental disorder that results in a small head and brain. They cite as evidence morphological anomalies in the face and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other camp maintains that LB1 is a new hominin species, separate from modern humans, deserving of its own taxonomical designation – H. floresiensis. In 2007 Dean Falk published an &lt;a href="http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/falk/HobbitJHEspecial.pdf"&gt;analysis of a virtual endocast of LB1’s skull&lt;/a&gt; – essentially a virtual picture of her brain. He argues that her brain does not have features in common with a microcephalic brain. It looks more like a modern human brain, but also has unique features all its own. In other words – it looks like the brain of a new and separate hominin species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of this year another team published an &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7243/abs/nature07989.html"&gt;analysis of LB1’s foot&lt;/a&gt;. They concluded that the foot definitely is that of a biped, but is more primitive than modern humans. It is longer in proportion to the femur, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another team from Stony Brook University Medical Center has &lt;a href="http://www.lifesciencesworld.com/news/view/125245"&gt;published a statistical analysis of all of the LB1 fossils.&lt;/a&gt; Rather than focusing on one feature, they looked at all the specimens and compared them to modern humans and to extant apes and humans with dwarfism. They found that LB1 does not cluster with modern humans or humans with dwarfism, but rather clusters with apes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding is consistent with the interpretation that LB1 is a hominin species that branched off from the human line some time in the past. It now seems that the bulk of the evidence, and multiple independent lines of evidence, are all pointing toward this conclusion and away from the microcephaly hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still two anticipated lines of evidence, however, that we do not yet have. We need to find more H. floresiensis specimens with skull parts, to confirm that LB1 is a representative specimen and not an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, because LB1 is only 18,000 years old, and not fossilized (the bones were found in a wet area and are a bit mushy) this creates the potential that we may be able to extract mitochondrial DNA from the bones. If we can (perhaps not likely because of the moisture) then we can compare this to humans, Neanderthals (whose mitochondria we do have) and apes and see where LB1 falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond confirmation that LB1 is a new species of bipedal hominins (although not ancestral to modern humans – just a side branch) there are also questions about how H. floresiensis is related to the human line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fossils which are 18,000 years old, there are stone tools that range from 13,000 to 90,000 years old that are associated with the fossils in such a way that they were almost definitely made by and used by H. floresiensis. These stone tools are more sophisticated than those used by H. erectus and are different than those used by modern humans. This also supports the side-branch hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stone tools were &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/flores.html"&gt;found elsewhere on Flores&lt;/a&gt; that date to about 840,000 years ago. These could be from an earlier population of H. floresiensis, or they could be from a population of H. erectus. &lt;a href="http://anthropology.si.edu/HumanOrigins/ha/erec.html"&gt;H. erectus&lt;/a&gt; lived from about 1.6 million to 400,000 years ago – although specimens in Java could be as young as 50,000 years ago. In any case, this is within the 840,000 year timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason to suspect that these tools may be from H. erectus, and that H floresiensis branched off from H. erectus, is that this was the first hominin species to spread out of Africa and across Asia. If H. floresiensis branched off earlier that H. erectus, then that would imply that some earlier hominin species spread out of Africa – something for which there is currently no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So H. floresiensis may force us to rewrite the story of hominin evolution and radiation – although not really the story of human evolution, because H. floresiensis is not on the line to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hesitation about simply concluding that H. floresiensis evolved from H. erectus is that LB1 has a really small brain, smaller than H. erectus – even when accounting for the reduction in overall stature. In other words, if you shrink down H. erectus to the height of a H. floresiensis, you don’t end up with the body proportions of H. floresiensis. H. floresiensis has a smaller brain still (about the size of a chimpanzee, but larger in proportion as chimps are bigger overall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that H. floresiensis specifically evolved a small brain, while retaining a rather advanced tool-making ability. This has led some to speculate that H. floresiensis had a more efficient brain design – packing more cerebral power into a smaller space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a fascinating story, that has much to teach us still. What I await most eagerly is the next high quality fossil specimens of H. floresiensis – that is almost certain to pack some surprises.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258647384000"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/11/gone_for_a_few_days.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b7138af0ba436bda</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this Blag"/><title type="html">Stuff To Do While I'm Away</title><published>2009-11-19T13:45:13Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T13:45:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~3/pRkwn84hw6g/gone_for_a_few_days.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/11/gone_for_a_few_days.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll be busy on through the weekend.

The real voting starts now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/"&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/a&gt; has been my labor of love for over three years. Unlike most other nominated podcasts, I do it almost entirely on my own: I have no co-hosts, producers, company, or sponsors behind me, like most. So I make my pitch that (if you like Skeptoid) it deserves your vote through all my hard work, even if there are other shows also nominated that you also like.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may note that there are several of your favorite skeptical podcasts nominated in various categories, including the excellent SGU from our fellow SkepticBlogger Steven Novella. I encourage you to vote carefully: If skeptics split our votes, we may have a Ross Perot effect and some totally random podcast will beat us all. So I’m asking you to choose Skeptoid in the Education category, which is the category in which it has a plausible chance to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To vote, go to &lt;a href="http://www.podcastawards.com/"&gt;http://www.podcastawards.com/&lt;/a&gt;, and vote for Skeptoid in the &lt;strong&gt;Peoples Choice&lt;/strong&gt; category (they misspelled it, but don’t be thrown off), and also the &lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt; category. Then fill in your name and submit the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads up that there are two annoying things about the voting process. First, you have to enter your email in a form (don’t worry, no spam) and click a link in your email to confirm your vote.

I tried to discuss these &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php"&gt;guidelines and the issues involved&lt;/a&gt; in a calm and rational way, relatively devoid of Insolence, Respectful or not-so-Respectful, yesterday, pointing out that screening guidelines were clearly due for revision but also recognizing the problems with the USPSTF recommendations and valid criticisms of them. In the end, I concluded that, among the critics, the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.net/patient/Cancer+News+and+Meetings/Expert+Perspective+on+Cancer+News/Expert+Perspective+from+ASCO+on+Mammography+Screening+for+Breast+Cancer"&gt;ASCO discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the proposed guidelines was the most reasonable At the same time, this being Orac and all, I couldn't resist snarkily dissing at least one overblown and unjustified criticism of the guidelines, coming from, embarrassingly, a professional organization to which I belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day later, I realize that the example of a brain dead and hyperbolic attack of the new guidelines was nothing compared with what was to come and, I suspect, still is to come. Although some attacks are just misguided and based on erroneous information, a lot of them are truly nothing more than appeals to emotion and logical fallacies. Indeed, the stupid is flaming fast and furious, flowing down the sides of the volcanoes of stupid spewing forth lots of heat, until the lava of stupid is finally lapping at the last walls defending rational discourse over what is a very difficult issue, both in terms of science, medicine, and policy. In fact, some of the attacks on the new guidelines carry distinct echoes of the same rhetorical techniques of Mike Adams and Joe Mercola. They have been truly painful to read, so full of neuron-necrosing nonsense that I wonder if those conspiracy theorists in tin foil hats might have a point, even though I realize that mere tinfoil will not stop such powerful waves of stupid. Worse, a lot of the press coverage has given free rein to the very same sorts of flaws that so irritate me in the coverage of alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just say right now that I am more forgiving of the press coverage that emphasizes anecdotes over data, stories like &lt;a href="http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/breast-cancer-patient-weighs-in-on-new-government-findings-for-detection-"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a pattern that I've seen emerging in the coverage of this story, namely the highlighting of an anecdote of a woman under 50 (or even under 40) who had a breast cancer that was detected either by screening mammography or by self breast examination. Another example is &lt;a href="http://www.tribstar.com/local/local_story_322000523.html"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;. This is lazy journalism at best, where finding the "human interest" angle trumps a science-based discussion of the pros and cons of the new recommendations, what they mean to women, and how they might be applied. It's the triumph of pure emotion over science. Meanwhile, Congress is getting involved, specifically Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who is &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/68137-congresswoman-wants-hearings-on-new-breast-cancer-screening-guidelines"&gt;threatening to hold Congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; on the matter. (Now &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;'s something that'll shed a lot of light on the science!) Wasserman is a breast cancer survivor; so I can understand her emotional investment in the issue. I can understand the emotional involvement of anyone who's life has been touched by cancer. Unfortunately, she's just plain misguided to try to meddle in the development of science-based medical guidelines this way. Her activities are far more likely to interfere with the scientific debate that must occur now regarding screening than they are to facilitate a new scientific consensus based on the strongest data available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've made my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php"&gt;position clear on the new guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. They are imperfect and most definitely do not mean that women under 50 should not be screened. Rather, they will most likely serve as reasonable, albeit flawed, starting point for a debate that has been brewing for the last several years as more and more studies have questioned how beneficial screening mammography is for younger women relative to its risks and documented the problems of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/overdiagnosis_of_breast_cancer_due_to_ma.php"&gt;overdiagnosis and overtreatment&lt;/a&gt;. I've also pointed out how I know that women will be confused by this change. In fact, if anything failure to communicate such a monumental change in recommendations in a manner that would mitigate some of this controversy is clearly the USPSTF's biggest failing in the matter. The task force did an absolutely execrable job of laying the groundwork for its announcement, so that it didn't appear to come out of nowhere. Even so, as I said before, an update of our screening guidelines was expected, and there is much to discuss. However, there is a relentless drumbeat of attack that is not based on science and strikes me as knee jerk. Some of it is downright idiotic; there's just no other way to put it. I feel obligated to address it because, as a skeptic, I find such bad arguments and misinformation an offense to my intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the idiocy falls into three general categories:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_makin_death_panels_for_your_mama.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_makin_death_panels_for_your_mama.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/uibNWTNiwwk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258645970920"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/church_of_scientology_is_a_cri.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d65538f2b63f77ec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Church of Scientology is a Criminal Organization</title><published>2009-11-19T15:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T15:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/bNwQZ-AFnjk/church_of_scientology_is_a_cri.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/church_of_scientology_is_a_cri.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to an Australian Australian Senator Nick Zenophon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/church_of_scientology_is_a_cri.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/church_of_scientology_is_a_cri.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/bNwQZ-AFnjk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258645652745"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NutritionalBlogma/~3/Wvjy_QL2PPE/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c7b793bd2fa90ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">An epigenetic mechanism for peripheral insulin resistance</title><published>2009-11-19T09:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T09:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/uM3OeDTGrcU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NutritionalBlogma/~3/Wvjy_QL2PPE/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">PGC-1alpha is my favorite gene/protein to study, as it is essential for mitochondrial regulation, influential on many diseases and ageing.  I also am fascinated by the relatively new field of epigenetics and its relation to nutrition and health.  So you can understand my geeky giddiness when I found that a study by Barrès et al.

One idea for dark matter is that it’s composed of weird (and as yet undetected) particles called WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles). A very odd property about them is that they are self-annihilating: when two of them touch, they turn into energy (and other, more easily detectable particles). When I first read about this several years ago I was pretty excited, because this is finally a testable hypothesis about dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/10/fermi-haze.jpg" alt="fermi-haze" title="fermi-haze" width="481" height="271"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fellow Hive Overmind blogger and astronomer Sean Carroll writes that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/10/28/has-fermi-seen-new-evidence-for-dark-matter/"&gt;it’s possible Fermi has done just this&lt;/a&gt;. The data are not conclusive, but very provocative nonetheless. He has the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t resist adding that on The Big Bang Theory a few weeks ago, Raj and Sheldon were investigating building a detector to look for this very type of dark matter. I wrote David Saltzberg, the science advisor (whom I met on the set last month when I was visiting LA; more on him and that at a later date) and told him this, and he noted that I was right. Well, how about that! It had to happen sometime. Now, to publish…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It features &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446697966?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0446697966"&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  and evangelical theologian &lt;strong&gt;Doug Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is being sponsored by me and &lt;a href="http://www.thepainteddoor.org/"&gt;The Painted Door&lt;/a&gt;, a Chicago church.  Following the screening will be a discussion about the movie featuring myself and &lt;strong&gt;Chad Meister&lt;/strong&gt;, editor of of the forthcoming &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844744175?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1844744175"&gt;God is Great, God is Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a refutation of Hitchens’ book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a debate.  Just a discussion of ideas discussed in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets cost $5 (you pay when you get there), but you must &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=204357380883"&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt; so we can add you to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the pertinent info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;: Screening of &lt;em&gt;Collision&lt;/em&gt; followed by a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

Other charities, schools, local governments, and other volunteer-based organizations would suffer as well...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here is my question. What kind of warped morality would wish this upon a nation?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, we ought to examine Kaffinator's premise for veracity before accepting his conclusion.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The differences in charity between secular and religious people are dramatic. Religious people are 25 percentage points more likely than secularists to donate money (91 percent to 66 percent) and 23 points more likely to volunteer time (67 percent to 44 percent)." [&lt;a href="http://www.policyreview.org/oct03/brooks_print.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, in Brooks' work, he goes off on a tangent concerning what we are discussing here: Democrats and Republicans, Left and Right, and correlating those with "secular and religious".  So it is a little difficult here to separate the various secularists from the various religionists, and that makes this source artice a little ambiguous.  I mean, Buddhists may be either "secularists" or "religionists", depending on criteria, which Brooks does not clearly delineate overall.  Each of the studies he cites use slightly different definitions and self-identification criteria to distinguish the groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it has been &lt;a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/139/story_13948_1.html"&gt;amply demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that aside from church attendance, factors like prayer and belief in God do &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; fall along "party lines".  See &lt;a href="http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/blog/?p=1312"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more.  The author wrongly conflates politics with religion, a fairly egregious intellectual error, especially considering the shifts of religious identification within parties over the decades, but let's stick to the topic...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, let's just consider Brooks' work as Kaff, and others, probably want it to be, and let "religious / people of faith" = Christian and "secular" = atheists.  I will freely say at the outset that I find myself agreeing that persons of faith &lt;i&gt;tend&lt;/i&gt; to be more charitable than those without, as a simple measure of reported giving of income to &lt;b&gt;general non-profits&lt;/b&gt;, including, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt;, their church.  However, and I think this is important, how much of the money given to the average church goes for a &lt;i&gt;charitable work&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us think for a moment about charity in effect versus charity in intent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For instance, the fiercely secular &lt;a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/3289.htm"&gt;AmeriCares&lt;/a&gt; reports that 99% of its income go to its programs!  In fact, a secular organization I belong to, CFI, &lt;a href="https://secure.ga3.org/05/donate_to_help_katrina_victims"&gt;links to this charity for hurricane relief&lt;/a&gt;.  Those who give $1 will see $0.99 go to help people there.  On the other hand, the Red Cross, which is also secular, only sees $0.95 of every $1 go to the people, and &lt;a href="http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/chris/2005/09/05/red_cross_ceo_pulled_down_651957_salary_bush_strafes_new_orleans.htm"&gt;there have been many accusations of corruption there&lt;/a&gt;.  Furthermore, the CEO of the Red Cross pulls down $600K, which is a ridiculous salary for a charity admin.  Given this information, I would much rather give to the Salvation Army before the Red Cross, and I could care the less that they are spreading what I consider to be a false message along with their help [although Charity Nav doesn't have data on them, since they don't have to file a 990], and to the AmeriCares organization before either one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this sense, we need to think about what you really want to do -- just evaluate people's giving, or evaluate &lt;b&gt;the effect of that charity&lt;/b&gt;.  I don't think you'd cry your eyes dry if corrupt and inefficient charities were bumped out and replaced by or subsumed by those of integrity and efficacy, secular or religious, would you?  If you care about people, you wouldn't.  If all you care about are the actions done [charity] and not what faith [or lack thereof] the acting parties maintain.  So, at the outset, I would like a little clarity in your question -- do you want to ask us atheists what would happen if everyone became atheists, &lt;i&gt;insofar as clothing the naked, feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, giving medical care to the sick, etc.,&lt;/i&gt; are concerned, or insofar as &lt;b&gt;churches&lt;/b&gt; are concerned?  Because we will need to define "charity" and think about how churches relate to charity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in the case of the average church, the church maintains land, a building, insurance, a staff (sometimes a large staff as a ratio of parishoners), vehicles, and all the overhead associated with all of those things.  In that sense, a &lt;i&gt;realtively HUGE&lt;/i&gt; portion of every $1 given as a "tithe" goes to do nothing but serve "the church" and not someone in need.  Let's be honest, here, most Christian giving is in tithes to their own church -- 10% of their income, according to the OT.  If we want to look at how much that 10% &lt;i&gt;can be considered &lt;b&gt;charity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, I would love to consider the argument anew.  In fact, let's think about this for a moment -- every church in america shuts down tomorrow, every mosque, every house of worship of any kind.  Now, suddenly, 10% of the income of 80-90% of the population (yes, I know this is estimating, but the gist remains) is free and available to be given to organizations &lt;i&gt;which do &lt;b&gt;nothing but&lt;/b&gt; feed the poor, clothe the naked, and bind up the wounds of the sick&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hmmmm...this issue is a little more complicated than you want to make it out to be, isn't it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let's look at what your study says about non-religious causes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Religious people are more generous than secular people with non-religious causes as well as with religious ones. While 68 percent of the total population gives (and 51 percent volunteers) to non-religious causes each year, religious people are 10 points more likely to give to these causes than secularists (71 percent to 61 percent) and 21 points more likely to volunteer (60 percent to 39 percent).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now this is impressive, but for a totally different reason:&lt;br&gt;While Christians [and others] have a commandment from God to give, and fear of hell, and hope of heaven, to motivate them, &lt;i&gt;a mere 10%&lt;/i&gt; difference is observed in what we can objectively call "pure charity work" insofar as money is concerned, and a &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; more substantial 21% in volunteering.  Would you wave this as a banner of triumph for your religion?  Pretty shoddy statistics to soapbox from, especially considering the organizational factor behind churches, etc., and that the prevalence of stay-at-home-moms among religionists is &lt;i&gt;much higher&lt;/i&gt; than secularists, and thus more available volunteers to pool from, etc.  Now, I won't defend those of us who are irreligious and have no empathy, nor rational self-interest extrapolated to altruism, as I believe it logically does.  Those people who do not care for their fellow human beings, religious or nonreligious, are a blight to those of us who do, and those of us who will take care of these apathists through our giving and volunteering at some point in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to the question at hand, though -- if all the churches in the country shut their doors tomorrow, would private schools and "pure charities" really suffer?  Those people who already demonstrate their willingness to give &lt;i&gt;without religious motivation&lt;/i&gt; would continue to do so, and it is logical to infer that those who are currently religious &lt;i&gt;would follow the trend observed&lt;/i&gt; once the churches shut their doors -- that a sizable chunk of them would continue to give, if not nearly all of them.  In fact, the sudden effluence of wealth created by the shutting of church doors would be available to do "pure charity work" = feeding, clothing, medical care, etc., with no "strings attached". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, your burden is, at this point, to rationalize how any people would actually suffer a loss of food, clothes, or medical care &lt;i&gt;if all churches were shut down tomorrow&lt;/i&gt;, and to consider your own question carefully, and perhaps to rephrase it to be more specific.  Atheists and other secularists really have an onus to do a better job in organizing and making a public spectacle of their giving, to "rally the troops", and to continue to maintain the moral high ground that we have:  when we do good, it is unquestionably and unequivocally because we care, have compassion for, and empathy for, our fellow human beings, and not for hope of reward [heaven], fear of punishment [hell], or the prodding and guilt trip of a pastor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus the issue is not as clear-cut as you would have it, and I will concede that secularists/atheists need to do a better job of promoting naturally-grounded ethics and morality and charity [humanists do a pretty good job here, but we need a broader front].  So do some more research and thinking, and please reformulate your question to consider the &lt;i&gt;effects&lt;/i&gt; of charity, versus the &lt;i&gt;facade&lt;/i&gt; of charity [church/tithing].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A compilation of articles and books on giving and faith:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.generousgiving.org/page.asp?sec=28&amp;amp;page=224"&gt;Faith and Philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two really good resources for those interested in the topic of charitable efficacy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/"&gt;Charity Navigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://charitywatch.org/"&gt;Charity Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The latter resource is most useful only if you are a member, write off and send $3 for a written report, or if you just want the top-rated charities.  The reason is that they don't report this information freely on their website for &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; charity they research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my agreement with you about the &lt;b&gt;general trend&lt;/b&gt; of charity and faith going hand-in-hand, you ought to read &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1567612,00.html"&gt;this article by an atheist who praises Christians for their charity work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted on 4/23/06&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-114582168952244693?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I’ll just give you the chorus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:x-small"&gt;folks              round here got the fear of god&lt;br&gt;
everybody say lawdy lawd&lt;br&gt;
there’s only one thing we fear more&lt;br&gt;
that’s the corps of engineers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words seem particularly appropriate today &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-katrina-flooding19-2009nov19,0,3370102.story"&gt;as we learn&lt;/a&gt; that a federal judge has ruled that the Corps is (big surprise) responsible for the levee failures in Katrina–indeed, that the agency is guilty of “gross negligence,” “insouciance, myopia and shortsightedness”, and so forth. The Corps’ poorly maintained Mississippi River Gulf Outlet made the damage from Katrina’s storm surge &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;, and the Corps knew it. It’s a sad fact, but can’t be ignored: Katrina was not simply an “act of God.” Neither was it simply an act of global warming. It was a disaster caused as much by human failures as by the workings of nature. &lt;/p&gt;

You&amp;#39;re going to bring out a new edition of &amp;quot;On The Origin of Species&amp;quot;, but to differentiate it from all the other editions, and to give some background to the sociopolitical ramifications of the theories of natural selection &amp;amp; shared descent, it is decided to have a new foreword by a leading scholar in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - who do you pick?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a) Ken Miller - leading evolutionary biologist &amp;amp; Christian; as witness in Dover v Kitzmiller gave vital testimony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;b) Dan Dennett - philosopher, scholar on evolutionary biology &amp;amp; cognitive science, sort of looks like Darwin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;c) Sean B Carroll - evolutionary biologist, expert author on DNA record for evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus comedy option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;d) Ray Comfort - evangelical leader of Way of the Master ministry, famed for persistent ignorance of basic scientific principles and making weird apparently unintentionally lascivious statements involving bananas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the underdog contestant from New Zealand pips them all to the post! Four ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, he won because he started the race a &lt;a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leading evangelical, Ray may be a slightly unusual choice. He's got a bit of a reputation of &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/11/comfortcameron.html"&gt;slightly odd behaviour&lt;/a&gt; (including his ministry videos where he interviews 'Darwinists' who turn out to be random students he blindsides with questions on the Big Bang). He constantly conflates Darwinism with nihilism, Big Bang cosmology with Nothing=Everything, atheists with Darwinists, Darwinism as a religion, bananas as divine providence, and essentially constructs the whole of science as one massive strawman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's famous for his Banana=Atheist Nightmare video (YouTube is full of mirrors made before he took it down, but is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39eYYYaB9Yc"&gt;now claiming it was intended to be humorous&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever, Ray), saying that the banana was proof of Divine Design. When it was pointed out to him that bananas are actually one of the most selectively cultivated fruits around (I &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana"&gt;wiki searched&lt;/a&gt; it in seconds, but then I&amp;#39;m a slave to laborious &amp;amp; tedious research like that) he apologised, then refuses to alter his argument one iota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, stellar credentials, m'kay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M'kay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's now given out his free copies of "On the Origin of Species", with helpful introduction (which used to be available on his Living Waters site, but as of writing this morning has now vanished) to students in &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/11/comfortcameron.html"&gt;unspecified universities&lt;/a&gt;. The NCSE has started the &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/index.php"&gt;Don't Diss Darwin&lt;/a&gt; site, which includes a &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/analysis.php"&gt;superb analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Ray's introduction. But anyone who can write that "DNA... presents a formidable challenge to Darwinian evolution" doesn't really deserve this level of attention. It's &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gish_gallop"&gt;traditional Gish Gallop&lt;/a&gt; material, and it's wearing pretty thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, attacking Darwin as a racist, a Nazi and whatever other pejorative you can think of, doesn't augment your argument, Ray. 'Darwinism' that you speak of (the theory of Natural Selection) is a mechanism for Evolution. Evolution &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Darwin didn't invent it. &lt;a href="http://cavalcadeofwhimsy.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/what-would-darwin-do/"&gt;I don't idolise Darwin&lt;/a&gt; - to speak of scientists having equal faith in Darwin is impotent conflation and projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray's introduction is nothing but anti-intellectual waffle, an absolute insult to true scholarship and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want a nice example of "science changed it's mind therefore we were right all along" + a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_z2xmCA9g8"&gt;little blackmail for eternal damnation&lt;/a&gt;? Here's a typical video from them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;And apparently us evil 'Darwinists' think we human primates are related to primates &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mzrliPFD0M"&gt;oh noes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A false dichotomy is not an intellectually honest move&lt;em&gt;. If the Left Wing party is shown to make a mistake, it doesn't automatically mean the Right Wing party are correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray has had this pointed out to him countless times; but, like his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/elephantine_errors_from_ray_co.php"&gt;demonstrable ignorance when it comes to the evolution of sex&lt;/a&gt; (he repeatedly claims that females of species had to evolve separately, with more more than a whiff of sexism there). If someone who has had leading experts show his flaws in reasoning refuses to update his argument in the face of evidence and reason, he has no right to parade his ignorance in order to 'teach both sides of the debate'. If anyone finds a copy of this edition, could you check the foreword to see if it was scribbled in with crayons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has to change in order to preserve integrity in the conclusions; it's not a fixed state. It's also not fair game to play silly semantic games over design - as Paley's Pal, Ray is fond of using the line 'a painter needs a painter' etc. As PZ Myers points out, does that mean &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/we_have_an_account_of_the_comf.php"&gt;thunder needs a thunderer&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray is, of course, perfectly entitled to his beliefs; whether it&amp;#39;s that Darwin was a proto-fascist, closet misogynist or most egregiously an atheist who recanted on his deathbed. All erroneous, but that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter. It&amp;#39;s when he views himself up to the level of debate &amp;amp; discourse against scientists schooled in peer-reviewed journals and rigorous academic &amp;amp; scientific discipline that I take issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was the author of a foreword to "On The Origin of Species", I'd mortified if I had to have basic science explained to me by an &lt;em&gt;Arts graduate&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>JohnGregson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258632424552"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18419">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45c4210e9a7675ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Advertising"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">New “Don’t Label Me” Billboard Campaign in the UK</title><published>2009-11-19T12:00:45Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T12:00:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/19/new-dont-label-me-billboard-campaign-in-the-uk/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The groups that brought you the “classlc” &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/10/21/help-put-a-pro-atheist-message-on-british-buses/"&gt;atheist bus ads&lt;/a&gt; are back with a billboard message that is sure to spark some great discussions:&lt;/p&gt;

Please don’t label me.  Let me grow up and choose for myself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How awesome is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a page from &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;‘ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618918248?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0618918248"&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where he makes a similar point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At Christmas-time one year my daily newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;, was looking for a seasonal image and found a heart-warmingly ecumenical one at a school nativity play. The Three Wise Men were played by, as the caption glowingly said, Shadbreet (a Sikh), Musharraf (a Muslim) and Adele (a Christian), all aged four. Charming? Heart-warming? No, it is not, it is neither; it is grotesque… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an identical photograph, with the caption changed as follows: “Shadbreet (a Keynesian), Musharaff (a Monetarist) and Adele (a Marxist), all aged four.” Wouldn’t this be a candidate for irate letters of protest? It certainly should be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins felt that prematurely labeling children like that was a form of child abuse.  Call it extreme, but he had a point.  Yet, parents do this all the time without thinking about it.  This billboard campaign is all about consciousness-raising, and it accomplishes just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the words featured prominently on the billboard, by the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do they call out parents who use the term “Protestant Child” or “Catholic Child,” they also point the finger at anyone who would use the terms “Agnostic Child” or “Humanist Child.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that, by all means, you should educate your child with your morals and values.  But there’s a difference between doing that and forcing an entire belief system on a child who doesn’t even have the capability to understand what that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this campaign — which, at its core, is not specifically atheistic — is to &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/nofaithschools"&gt;challenge state-funded faith schools&lt;/a&gt;, which by nature label children with a religious label and get taxpayer money to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Help the British Humanist Association (BHA) in its effort to phase out state funded ‘faith’ schools and reform our education system by ensuring we can employ our dedicated campaigns officer against faith schools for another year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BHA campaigns for inclusive schools with no religious admissions policies, balanced teaching about different beliefs and values, and no compulsory ‘collective worship’. The BHA also campaigns to combat the growing threat to education from creationism and pseudoscience, as well as for wider improvements to values and moral education across the school curriculum and supports improved Sex and Relationships Education, Citizenship Education and inclusion of Philosophy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them.  As I write this, they’ve raised nearly £9,000 toward their &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/nofaithschools"&gt;£30,000 fundraising goal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

You&amp;#39;d be forgiven for thinking they&amp;#39;ve gone silly. They may have. But another possibility is that you&amp;#39;ve chosen a shrewd expert who&amp;#39;s totally up-to-speed with the latest decision-making research: Ap Dijksterhuis and his colleagues have just shown that people with expertise in football are better at predicting match outcomes when they spend time not consciously thinking about their predictions.In an initial experiment, 352 Dutch undergrads were divided into football experts and non-experts, based on their self-ratings, and they were all asked to make predictions (home or away win, or draw) about four forthcoming football matches in the top Dutch league - the Eredivisie. The students were shown the four pairs of competing teams for twenty seconds, and then one third of them were asked to make immediate predictions; one third were asked to consciously think for two minutes before making their predictions; and a final third engaged in a distracting, numerical memory task for two minutes before making their predictions.For the non-experts, it didn&amp;#39;t make any difference to their success whether or not they were able to spend time considering their predictions - they were correct between forty and fifty per cent of the time regardless. By contrast, the experts&amp;#39; predictions were significantly more accurate when they were distracted for two minutes, compared with when they made an instant or a considered prediction (approx 60 vs. 50 per cent accuracy). In other words, the experts were most accurate when they spent time not consciously thinking about the problem at hand.This may seem bizarre but it&amp;#39;s entirely consistent with Dijksterhuis&amp;#39;s Unconscious Thought Theory and with the folk wisdom that says it&amp;#39;s a good idea to sleep on a problem. According to Dijksterhuis&amp;#39;s theory, the subconscious is sometimes less prone to the biases that afflict the conscious mind, thus ensuring that an expert gives due weight to the most important factors. This was borne out in a second experiment, much like the first, in which students predicted the outcomes of World Cup football matches. Again, distracted experts made the most accurate predictions. This time, however, the researchers also asked participants to estimate the teams&amp;#39; world rankings - apparently this is the most reliable predictor for the outcomes of World Cup matches. For experts who spent time consciously considering their match predictions, there was no correlation between their knowledge of team rankings and their prediction accuracy. By contrast, for the experts who spent time not thinking about their predictions, there was a correlation between their ranking knowledge and predictive accuracy. Not consciously thinking about the problem at hand seemed to ensure that experts paid due attention to the most important factor affecting match outcomes.The researchers warned that subconscious thought is not always superior to conscious thought. But they concluded: &amp;quot;Our results mean that unconscious thought may well be helpful in more situations than some people currently think.&amp;quot;_________________________________Dijksterhuis A, Bos MW, van der Leij A, &amp;amp; van Baaren RB (2009).

Indeed, it is often recommended as the method of choice for pain relief  in “natural” childbirth. It’s hardly natural, though. In fact, it is completely unnatural. No primates give birth in water, because primates initiate breathing almost immediately after birth and the entire notion of waterbirth was made up only 200 years ago. Not surprisingly, waterbirth appears to increase the risk of neonatal death.&lt;/p&gt;

Out of 4,030 deliveries in water, 35 babies suffered serious problems and 3 subsequently died. It is unclear if any of the deaths can be attributed to delivery in water. However, of the 32 survivors who were admitted to the NICU, 13 had significant respiratory problems including pneumonia, meconium aspiration, water aspiration, and drowning. Other complications attributable to water birth include 5 babies who had significant hemorrhage due to snapped umbilical cord. In all, 18 babies had serious complications directly attributable to waterbirth. The risk of serious complications necessitating prolonged NICU admissions was 4.5/1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals in Ireland &lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/water-births-put-on-hold-after-death-1410945.html"&gt;suspended the practice of waterbirth&lt;/a&gt; after a baby died from freshwater drowning after delivery in a waterbirth pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most nonsensical aspect of waterbirth is that it puts the baby at risk for freshwater drowning. The second nonsensical aspect is that the baby is born into what is essentially toilet water, because the water in the pool is fecally contaminated. In &lt;a href="http://journals.indexcopernicus.com/abstracted.php?icid=14548"&gt;Water birth and the risk of infection; Experience after 1500 water births&lt;/a&gt;, Thoeni et al. analyzed the water found in waterbirth pools both before and after birth. The water in a birth pool, conveniently heated to body temperature, the optimum temperature for bacterial growth, is a microbial paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors were aware that the water system itself can harbor bacteria, given the report of at least two neonatal deaths from Legionella pneumonia, one that occurred in the hospital, and one that occurred at home. Therefore, they tested the water before anyone entered the pool. To their surprise and dismay, analysis of the water itself revealed that 12% of samples contained Legionella pneumophila, 11% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 19% Enterococcus, 21% coliforms, and 10% Escherichia coli. Most of these organisms can and do cause infections in neonates. After installing a special water filter, and instituting more stringent pool cleaning procedures, contamination of the water by these bacteria was reduced, but not eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the water after birth was shocking. Almost all 200 water samples were heavily contaminated with various infectious bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the samples taken after the birth there was a high rate of contamination with coliforms (82%) and Escherichia coli (64%) with concentrations of up to 105cfu/100 ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylocooccus aureus, and yeasts were found less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors claim that the fecally contaminated water did not affect the rate of infection. However, the study is underpowered to reliably detect the impact of the contaminated water on the rate of infection. Second, the authors express their claim in a curious way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1.34% of children (10 of 741) born in water showed infectious signs such as tachypnea and suspect skin color compared with 3.40% (15 of 440) in the [control] group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant finding is not which babies displayed &lt;em&gt;signs&lt;/em&gt; of infection. The relevant finding is which babies actually had infections. The authors neglect to share that information; we should keep in mind the possibility that there was a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterbirth is praised for its ability to ease pain in some women, but is that really worth the risk of delivering a baby into fecally contaminated water teeming with harmful bacteria? What’s “natural” about that?&lt;/p&gt;

Well, the good news is that everyone who’s written about it has helped get the story successfully out there in the mainstream media like the NY Times, The Guardian, the Atlantic, and the Rachel Maddow Show, where it will hopefully garner enough attention to ensure something is done to correct the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

Then The Gap mentioned &lt;strong&gt;“several unrelated holidays&lt;/strong&gt;” in this commercial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/christians-call-the-gap-naughty-even-after-getting-what-they-want/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/oVMPWlWDvsI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://action.afa.net/takeaction/gap/"&gt;The commercial of course made the ironically named American Family Association furious&lt;/a&gt;. And I can see why. I’ve never seen such an anti-Christian commercial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFA believes this ad to be completely dismissive and disrespectful to those who celebrate the meaning and spirit of Christmas. AFA asked Gap for a meeting to discuss the ad, but Gap has not responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is Gap’s answer to recognizing Christmas, we are deeply disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://action.afa.net/Detail.aspx?id=2147489678"&gt;The AFA also wrote&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis theirs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you notice it? &lt;strong&gt;Gap compares Christmas to the pagan holiday called “Solstice.” Solstice is celebrated by Wiccans who practice witchcraft!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gap also encourages you to “86″ or “dismiss” traditions and “do what feels just right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those heathens at The Gap should be crucified for this outrage…or burnt at the stake. You know who I think is really to blame here? The Jews. First they kill Jesus and now this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone to call the The Gap’s customer service number (1-800-427-7895, Select more options then feedback to get a live person) and thank them for the all-inclusive commercial to counteract the nonsense of bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revolutionary new breast-growing technique, Neopac, will be available to some breast cancer survivors in trials starting in January, according to the Daily Mail. And within a decade, cosmetic surgeons may open up the treatment to all women who want to amplify their cleavage, the paper reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery could replace breast reconstruction and implants soon, says the &lt;a title="Telegraph Group Ltd." href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Telegraph+Group+Ltd."&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation already has succeeded in pigs, which grew new breasts in just six weeks, according to the Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last part should make Kermit the Frog very happy. I know I like my pigs with giant knockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the procedure, pioneered at the &lt;a title="Australian Bernard O&amp;#39;Brien Institute of Microsurgery" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Australian+Bernard+O%27Brien+Institute+of+Microsurgery"&gt;Australian Bernard O’Brien Institute of Microsurgery&lt;/a&gt;, a breast-shaped chamber is inserted under the chest skin, according to the Daily Mail.

In their recent issue featuring Actress Demi Moore on the cover, they seem to have removed a rather large section of Moore’s hip. Suffice it to say, it did not go unnoticed by many, many people. Maybe they should change their name to &lt;em&gt;WTF&lt;/em&gt; Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

Next up in the queue is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Isis, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm a regular lurker at your blog who is writing on behalf of my mother - she's a fourth grade teacher in an inner-city district in Arizona, and she has one very gifted young Hispanic girl in her class this year. Unfortunately, this girl's trying to hide her talent for math because she seems to think it's incompatible with being part of the cool, girly group of girls. Since you're the best example I know of someone who does very hot science while still being cool and feminine: do you have any suggestions for role models my mother can tell this girl about or other strategies to encourage her to develop her aptitudes? I would love to show her the Goddess's blog, but it's not really school-appropriate for the fourth grade... awesome though it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A million thanks (from someone whose shoes are nowhere near worthy),&lt;br&gt;[Awesome name redacted by Dr. Isis]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's the situation. I've read this email a few times. I'm trying to come up with something. I really am, but everytime I read this letter (and, I won't lie, I received it a few weeks ago), I get fixated on this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...she's a fourth grade teacher in an &lt;u&gt;inner-city district in Arizona&lt;/u&gt;, and she has one &lt;u&gt;very gifted young Hispanic girl &lt;/u&gt;in her class this year...[math is] incompatible with being &lt;u&gt;part of the cool, girly group of girls.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, especially before people start losing their shit in here, that I am having a very hard time not projecting my own personal experiences in this situation.  I mean, I wondered why this reader pointed out to me that the little girl in question is Hispanic.  I can&amp;#39;t seem to get my mind off of it.  You see, when I was a girl in school in Eastern Los Angeles, this was the group of girls folks were afraid I would reject science and math for...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General Relativity is our theory of gravity, which relates the curvature of space to the gravitational acceleration of objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This theory only works in certain regimes; it breaks down at the point of singularities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A black hole, as predicted by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild"&gt;Schwarzschild&lt;/a&gt;, is a singularity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, since singularities are forbidden by General Relativity, there is no reason to think that black holes exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
(You can watch his video &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4GFAjX62Yg&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or read his full argument &lt;a href="http://www.sjcrothers.plasmaresources.com/PhD.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  Therefore, he argues, astronomers are wasting their time looking for black holes, since their existence isn't even a physical prediction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math/CygnusX1_lg.jpg" width="500" title="What Cygnus X-1 looks like through a good amateur telescope." alt="CygnusX1_lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about not seeing a forest for the trees.  The "singularity" is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; essential for a black hole to exist.  Honestly, it isn't important &lt;b&gt;at all&lt;/b&gt; whether there's a singularity or not.  All that matters, &lt;i&gt;in the real world&lt;/i&gt;, is that something is both &lt;b&gt;massive&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;compact enough&lt;/b&gt; so that, within a certain radius, light cannot escape from it.  That is the &lt;i&gt;astrophysical&lt;/i&gt; definition of a black hole.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math/accretion_mpowen_full.jpg" width="500" alt="accretion_mpowen_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do they exist?  &lt;b&gt;Definitely.&lt;/b&gt;  Where do you look for incontrovertible proof?  The center of the galaxy!  There are no two ways around it; there is &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; a black hole there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math/phot-23a-02-normal.jpg" width="500" height="456" title="Say hello to the center of the galaxy.  Literally." alt="phot-23a-02-normal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How am I so sure?  The above image shows the center of our galaxy.  There are many, many stars orbiting the central point where the arrows are pointing.  We have tracked these orbits over more than a decade, thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghezgroup/gc/pictures/orbitsMovie.shtml"&gt;the UCLA Galactic Center Group&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's a screenshot of their results.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math/galactic%20center.jpg" width="500" title="Orbits of actual stars at the galactic center!" alt="galactic center.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the motion of these orbits, we can figure out what the mass of the object they orbit around is.  It turns out to be &lt;b&gt;over 2 million times as massive as our Sun&lt;/b&gt;.  And yet, we don't see any light coming from that point.  We don't see a white dwarf, we don't see a neutron star, we don't see any object at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a mass that large, you will have a &lt;i&gt;black hole&lt;/i&gt; if that mass is confined to a sphere of a diameter of about &lt;b&gt;ten million kilometers&lt;/b&gt;.  That isn't hard, considering we have many, many stars that we know of where an entire solar mass is confined to a diameter of about &lt;b&gt;ten&lt;/b&gt; kilometers.  (These are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"&gt;neutron stars&lt;/a&gt;.)  If you up the mass, the neutrons at the core will eventually collapse under the tremendous pressures, and collapse farther.  There's a &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_5/notes21.html"&gt;well-known&lt;/a&gt; upper limit to how massive a neutron star can be, and it's less than &lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt; solar masses, much less two million.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math/neutron%20star.jpg" width="500" alt="neutron star.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can argue about whether singularities violate General Relativity or not until you're blue in the face.  It doesn't have a damned thing to do with whether any light gets out of your ultra-dense, massive object.  And that's what we call a black hole, and it exists.  Don't believe it?  Then tell me what's going on at the galactic center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/are_black_holes_forbidden_math.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258608320681"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/youve_all_forgotten_about_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9a6ce2dbb13c922</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">You've all forgotten about the Molly awards, haven't you?</title><published>2009-11-19T04:47:11Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T04:47:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/kDI8zzO-MNM/youve_all_forgotten_about_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/youve_all_forgotten_about_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nah, I know you didn&amp;#39;t…but I finally got around to tallying up the votes, and the winners of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/molly.php"&gt;Molly award&lt;/a&gt; for the month of September are &lt;b&gt;Desert Son&lt;/b&gt; [New complementary close under construction] and &lt;b&gt;Feynmaniac&lt;/b&gt;.

Specifically, his sworn testimony in a pretrial deposition was found to be seriously contradicted by his equally sworn testimony in the court.  Though it ultimately came to nothing, Judge Jones went so far as to refer the matter to prosecutors for potential perjury charges.  (See &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day18pm.html#day18pm350" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day18pm2.html#day18pm1282" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the pertinent testimony.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a roughly similar situation appears to have arisen in the Freshwater affair.  It centers around the process by which Zachary Dennis was burned with a Tesla coil, and Freshwater is contradicting himself about it in two sets of sworn testimony and a motion filed in federal court.  I’ll describe them in separate sections, reproducing a good deal of the testimony for the flavor of what goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First recall that there are three legal proceedings under way, the administrative hearing on Freshwater’s termination; a federal suit brought against the district, administrators, and Freshwater; and a federal suit brought by Freshwater against the Dennis family, the district, and sundry others (including a number of unidentified John or Jane Does).  The first two are the focus here.  This is a long post, with lots of quotations from various of the legal venues, but it should give a feeling for the problems Freshwater is creating for himself in his sworn testimony in the several proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A schedule note:  The administrative hearing was supposed to resume November 17, but did not do so and has been postponed to Dec 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative hearing testimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there’s Zachary’s hearing testimony on May 7, 2009, under questioning by Freshwater’s attorney about how Freshwater used the Tesla coil on students’ arms.  In his testimony, (Transcript XIX 5-7-09.pdf) Zachary described it this way.  I’ve extracted pertinent parts from the transcript; there was a fair amount of shuffling around to set up a demonstration table with an overhead projector.  Throughout the quotations in this section “Q” is R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, and “A” is Zachary.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Describing how the Tesla coil felt on his skin, Zachary testified&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 A. My experience the first time it was applied to me was a&lt;br&gt;
5 burning sensation. It left little tiny welt-like things, and&lt;br&gt;
6 then it turned red. And it just felt like static electricity&lt;br&gt;
7 shock but stronger.&lt;br&gt;
8 Q. Referring back to your diagram, Employee Exhibit No. 61,&lt;br&gt;
9 where did the application of the Tesla coil take place upon&lt;br&gt;
10 you?&lt;br&gt;
11 A. On the overhead.&lt;br&gt;
12 Q. On the overhead. Using what’s going to be a blue&lt;br&gt;
13 marker, I want you to mark on Employee Exhibit No. 61&lt;br&gt;
14 precisely where you had the Tesla coil applied to you in John&lt;br&gt;
15 Freshwater’s classroom.&lt;br&gt;
16 A. (Witness complied.)&lt;br&gt;
17 Q. And you circled the overhead?&lt;br&gt;
18 A. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some rearranging of furniture in the hearing room to represent the classroom with an overhead projector near the front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22 Q. So Mr. Freshwater was standing behind the projector but&lt;br&gt;
23 between his desk and the overhead projector. Correct?&lt;br&gt;
24 A. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
25 Q. Standing slightly off center to the right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and then from succeeding testimony:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q. Okay. So when you walked up, Mr. Freshwater is holding&lt;br&gt;
19 the Tesla coil. Which hand is he holding the Tesla coil in?&lt;br&gt;
20 A. Probably his left or right. I don’t know what hand.&lt;br&gt;
21 Q. Well, it has to be left or right. Which do you think it&lt;br&gt;
22 would be?&lt;br&gt;
23 A. Most likely his left.&lt;br&gt;
24 Q. So left hand?&lt;br&gt;
25 A. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SNIP]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 Q. So at this point, what happens next? You approach.&lt;br&gt;
8 Just tell me what happens next.&lt;br&gt;
9 A. I put my arm like this.&lt;br&gt;
(Laid his arm on the plate of the overhead projectors)&lt;br&gt;
10 Q. Um-hum.&lt;br&gt;
11 A. Then he put his arm like this. &lt;br&gt;
(Indicating Freshwater’s arm was across Zach’s hand’wrist)&lt;br&gt;
12 And then he took the Tesla coil and went up and down twice and across twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SNIP]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23 A. Put your forearm here, and take this hand and go up and&lt;br&gt;
24 down twice and across twice.&lt;br&gt;
25 Q. Okay. Now, I’m holding this like a pen.&lt;br&gt;
1 A. Go like this.&lt;br&gt;
2 Q. Okay. Now, what you’ve just described this as is a fist&lt;br&gt;
3 with a pen inserted into my fist. Correct?&lt;br&gt;
4 A. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
5 Q. Okay. You may touch me and just go ahead and&lt;br&gt;
6 demonstrate. And this is the guy that matters right here.&lt;br&gt;
7 A. Okay.&lt;br&gt;
8 Q. So if you won’t mind standing right there for me,&lt;br&gt;
9 demonstrate what occurred.&lt;br&gt;
10 A. Okay. Down, like, about four inches, and up and down&lt;br&gt;
11 and across and across. Kind of pulls his arm, lifted up his&lt;br&gt;
12 arm. And I walked back to my seat.&lt;br&gt;
13 Q. Walked back to your seat, and that was that?&lt;br&gt;
14 A. That was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SNIP]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton got a volunteer from the gallery to serve as Zach’s body double in the demonstration so Zach could direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 Q. Zach, you get in whatever position you need to see.&lt;br&gt;
9 A. Okay.&lt;br&gt;
10 Q. Would you agree that the individual coming up just put&lt;br&gt;
11 their right arm down? Correct?&lt;br&gt;
12 A. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
13 Q. Now, when they put their right arm down, Mr. Freshwater,&lt;br&gt;
14 you said, used his right arm over your right wrist. Correct?&lt;br&gt;
15 A. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
16 Q. Now, when he put his right arm over your right wrist,&lt;br&gt;
17 was his hand clenched or was it palm on your wrist&lt;br&gt;
18 controlling your wrist?&lt;br&gt;
19 A. I think it was clenched, not palm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SNIP]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Q. Okay. And at that point, did you feel like you could&lt;br&gt;
3 pull away?&lt;br&gt;
4 A. No.&lt;br&gt;
5 Q. If you wanted to pull your arm out, did you feel like&lt;br&gt;
6 you could or could not?&lt;br&gt;
7 A. No.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So in Zach’s testimony we see him with his arm on the plate of the overhead, Freshwater with one forearm holding down Zach’s wrist with the Tesla coil in his other hand, and he makes two vertical swipes and two horizontal swipes with the Tesla coil on Zach’s forearm.  The picture above is nearly identical to what Zachary described in his earlier testimony in October 28, 2008 (I’m not going to type out that transcript, too!  I have images of the text that can’t be cut and pasted.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider Freshwater’s testimony in the hearing on October 28, 2008, late the same day that Zachary first testified.  Freshwater testified that he did use the Tesla coil on Zachary’s arm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q.  How did  you do this?  You heard Zach’s description.  Do you disagree with that or agree with it?  Zach’s description was, he placed his arm on the overhead projector, you held his hand with one arm and put a mark up and down and crossed with the other.  That part is what I’m asking you about, not what  you described it as [the daisy chain of students].  I’m going to ask you about that later.  But the method by which you did it …&lt;br&gt;
A.  You’re – I’m not getting your question.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  I’m sorry.  I asked you, is that accurate?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Is that accurate?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  I believe I said, do you agree with Zach’s testimony?&lt;br&gt;
A.  No.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  You tell us how you did it.&lt;br&gt;
A.  When?  With Zach?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  Let’s start with Zach.&lt;br&gt;
A.  I do not remember to go into that detail.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  If you don’t remember, are you sure that Zach is inaccurate?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Is he inaccurate?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  In the way he described that you did it to him.&lt;br&gt;
A.  I don’t do it that way, so that would be inaccurate.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  How do you do it?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Zach mentioned one way, students holding hands I’m holding it –&lt;br&gt;
Q.  I’m talking specifically to Zach.  Did  you put–did you use this device on Zach Dennis’s …&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes&lt;br&gt;
Q. … arm?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And did it leave a mark that you saw?&lt;br&gt;
A.  No.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And how did you do it when you used it on Zach’s arm?&lt;br&gt;
A.  The student comes up and gives me their arm.  And I just use the Tesla coil on them.  And most of the time they pull away.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  And if you would hold their arm down they wouldn’t be able to pull away.&lt;br&gt;
A.  I didn’t hold his arm down.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  That wasn’t my question.  If you hold their arm down, they won’t be able to pull away, would they?  That’s my question.&lt;br&gt;
A.  If I held their arm down, would they be able to pull away?  No.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a bit later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Now, when students come up and volunteer, does it ever leave a mark?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Does it leave a mark?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  When you’re dealing with individual students.  I’m not talking about where you have them holding hands like there.  But when you’re dealng with an individual student and you’re marking their arm or you’re using it on their arm, does it ever leave a mark?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Slight red, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then a little later:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Zach also testified that you indicated this would leave a mark like a tattoo of a cross for a short period of time.&lt;br&gt;
A.  I do not remember saying that.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  You’re seen the pictures?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And do you find that those are accurate depictions of Zach’s arm?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Are they?  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  At various times this has been described as an X or a cross.  Quote frankly, I don’t care which one it is at the moment.  But did  you ever describe that you put an X on students?&lt;br&gt;
A.  I do not remember saying anything about a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  That wasn’t my question.  My question is, Did you ever say that you puit an X on him?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Is an X a mark?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And is it your position that you put an X on Zach and not a cross?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have Freshwater conceding that he put a mark on Zachary’s arm, and he claims that it’s an X and not a cross.  He disputes the accuracy of Zachary’s account of exactly how it got there, but he cannot remember specifically how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshwater Deposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-October 2009 Mr. Freshwater was deposed by the Dennis family’s attorney for their federal suit.  Recall that the &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/one-freshwater.html" rel=""&gt;school district defendants settled&lt;/a&gt; their portion of that suit in August 2009 but Freshwater remains a defendant in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the deposition Doug Mansfield, the Dennis’s attorney, questioned Freshwater about the incident.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After reading Freshwater’s testimony from the admin hearing:&lt;br&gt;
Q.  So in your previous testimony [in the hearing] you confirmed that this device would leave red marks on kids’ arms.&lt;br&gt;
A.  On myself.  On me.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Well, the question was asking about students, was it not?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Can you read that again, sir?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  “Question: But when you’re dealing with an individual student and you’re marking their arm or you’re using it on their arm, does it ever leave a mark?”&lt;br&gt;
“Answer: Slight red, yeah.”&lt;br&gt;
Did I read that correctly?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes, you read it correctly.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And so your testimony then is – your testimony then was that yes, it would leave a red mark on a kid’s arm when you applied it to them.  Is that true?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Like I say, I misspoke there.  I’m talking about myself.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  You believe it would leave a red mark on your arm, right?  That’s what you just said.&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  But you don’t think it would leave a red mark on a kid’s arm?&lt;br&gt;
A.  I’ve never – I haven’t seen red marks on kids’ arms, sir.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Don’t you think if it left a red mark on your arm, it would. likewise, leave a red mark on a kid’s arm?&lt;br&gt;
A.  We need to back up.  We talked about with me how many times I use it on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[SNIP]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q,  You’ve seen pictures of the mark on James Doe’s arm,&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  And you saw those in previous testimony.&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes, I saw them.  I’m just trying to think when I saw the first one.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  And it’s fair to say, isn’t it, that at least as depicted in those pictures, and I understand that you dispute that you did that, but at least in those pictures the mark that appears on James Doe’s arm is in the shape of a cross, correct?&lt;br&gt;
A.  No.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  You don’t agree with that?&lt;br&gt;
A.  I don’t agree with that.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  What do you think that the mark looks like?&lt;br&gt;
A.  I’m going to – we keep talking about this mark –&lt;br&gt;
Q.  I’m simply asking –&lt;br&gt;
A.  No, let me put – can I say something, sir?&lt;br&gt;
Q.  No, you may not.  If you have something to say –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR. HAMILTON [Freshwater’s attorney]:  If you’re going to let him answer the question, he was trying to answer your question.&lt;br&gt;
MR. MANSFIELD:  Well, he’s not answering my question.  My question was a simple one.  Would you read back my question, please? [Reporter read it back]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.  Like an X.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Okay.  When you applied the Tesla coil to James Doe’s arm, is it your testimony that you made a shape in the form of an X or a shape in the form of a cross?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MR. HAMILTON:  I’m going to object at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.  On advice of my counsel I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to be free from self-incrimination as the existing statute of limitation in this matter has not expired.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Let me show  you something from your testimony from your termination hearing.  On page 403, line 6,   Let’s go back to line 1.  “Question:  The various times this has been described as an X or a cross, I frankly don’t care which one it is at the moment, but did you ever describe that you put an X on students”?  “Answer:  I do not remember ever saying anything about a cross.”  Did I read those two correctly?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  The next line: “Question:  That wasn’t my question.  My question is did you ever say that you put an X on him?”  “Answer: Yes.”  Did I read those correctly?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  The next question: “Is an X a mark?”  Answer: “Yes.”  Did I read those correctly?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  The next question: “Question:  Is it your position here today that you put an X on James and not a cross?”  “Answer: Yes.”  Did I read those correctly?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
[Several lines of back and forth in confusion]&lt;br&gt;
Q.  That wasn’t my question, sir.  My question was your testimony at the time when you testified during your termination proceedings was that you put a mark on James Doe’s  arm and not a cross.  Is that correct?&lt;br&gt;
A.  Then I will have to say I misspoke there.  I did not put a mark.&lt;br&gt;
Q.  Now today you’re denying putting any kind of mark on James Doe’s arm; is that correct?&lt;br&gt;
A.  That would be correct.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in his hearing testimony he made a mark, and in his deposition he didn’t.  When asked specifically about whether he put a mark on Zachary’s arm, he now takes the Fifth Amendment, which is his right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filing for Summary Judgment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deposition didn’t get into the procedure Zachary described that Freshwater disputed.  But there is one final document that was recently filed in the federal case that’s pertinent.  On November 16, 2009, Freshwater filed for summary judgment for dismissal of the battery claim in the civil suit the Dennis family brought against him.  In the section of that filing titled “Statement of Material Facts” there’s this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of class, Mr. Freshwater asked whether anybody wanted to see what the tesla coil felt like. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 142&lt;/em&gt;. James testified that he was the last of five or so students to go up to the front of the class to have the tesla coil applied to him. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 142-143&lt;/em&gt;. Prior to going up to have the tesla coil applied to him, James watched the other students get the tesla coil applied to their arm. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 144&lt;/em&gt;. James witnessed the electric charge touch the other students’ skin. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 145&lt;/em&gt;  The application of the tesla coil on the other students was similar to the application that happened to James.  James volunteered by approaching Mr. Freshwater in the front of the class and placed his right arm on an overhead projector. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 146-147&lt;/em&gt;. Mr. Freshwater used his left wrist and laid it on top of James’ right wrist and Mr. Freshwater took his right hand to guide the tesla coil on James’ arm making two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 147-148&lt;/em&gt;. The application of the tesla coil on James skin lasted around five seconds. &lt;em&gt;Id. at 148&lt;/em&gt;. The application of the tesla coil on James’ skin was similar to a “static shock” and “kind of burned a little bit and itchy.” &lt;em&gt;Id. at 151-153&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, while in his deposition Freshwater denied the accuracy of Zachary’s hearing testimony, in the motion for summary judgment it is described exactly as Zachary told it.  In fact, the motion’s description of the process is drawn from Zachary’s deposition in the case – the &lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;s refer to that deposition.  So Freshwater’s attorneys in the federal suit accept Zachary’s version for purposes of asking for dismissal of the battery claim.  (Incidentally, Zachary’s version was also at least partly corroborated by &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/11/freshwater-oct.html" rel=""&gt;another student in that class&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will freely grant that eyewitness testimony is far from the best evidence regardless of the deference the U.S. legal system gives it.  I will also freely grant that human memory is subject to many vicissitudes.  Nevertheless I find the contradictions and inconsistencies fascinating, just as a slow-motion train wreck is fascinating.

If...."good” must mean approximately the same thing when we apply it to God as what it means when we apply it to human beings, then the fact of suffering provides a clear empirical refutation of the existence of a being who is both omnipotent and perfectly good. If on the other hand, we are prepared to give up the idea that “Good” in reference to God means anything like what it means when we refer to humans as good, then the problem of evil can be sidestepped, but any hope of a rational defense of Christianity goes by the boards.&lt;/em&gt;  - Victor Reppert.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've already commented on the Euthyphro dilemna  &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/01/christian-illusion-of-moral.html"&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;First posted 2/1/06&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-113880123759079999?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Einstein showed that any object with mass cannot reach, let alone exceed, the speed of light. But science fiction tends to overlook this very inconvenient truth simply because the universe is so big. To reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star after our own Sun, would take more than four years for a spaceship moving at the speed of light, and a jaunt across the full diameter of our galaxy would take 100,000 years. Knowing this, script writers imagine solutions like Star Trek’s “warp drive” that allow the Enterprise to travel around the galaxy at multiples of light speed, or “worm holes” that provide cosmic short cuts.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png/600px-Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:150px;height:150px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/SwSd9tLTAVI/AAAAAAAAABs/kDe7gKVX5vc/s320/600px-Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although NASA and some scientists have speculated about warp drives and worm holes, no one yet has the slightest idea of how to build an actual device that will beat Einstein’s limit, which may never happen. But although science fiction has to use imagination to move events along, there is increasing interest at the other end of the scale, where light itself is slowed down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people know that light moves at a constant speed of about 300,000 kilometers/second (186,000 miles/second), and are startled to hear that light can also move more slowly; but it can, because the quoted speed applies only to light in vacuum. In a transparent medium like glass or plastic, the speed can drop nearly by half. 150,000 kilometers/second is still enormously fast, but it means that when you observe the world through a pane of glass, you’re seeing events a tiny slice of time later than someone looking through an open window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200104/images/experiment.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:320px;height:255px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/SwScmXuzyXI/AAAAAAAAABU/KwQ2gQOBEHM/s320/experiment.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That’s not the end of it, because scientists have made light move much more slowly yet. The breakthrough came in 1999, when Danish-born physicist Lene Hau, working at Harvard and the Rowland Institute in Cambridge, brought a ray of laser light to a speed of 61 kilometers/per hour (that’s 38 miles per hour, not per second), almost comparable to a briskly pedaled bicycle. A year later, she dialed the speed down to slower than a walk, 1 mile/hour, and then in 2001 came the ultimate: she brought a light ray to a dead halt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomography.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/bec_peaks_jpg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:320px;height:214px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/SwSbzOUF66I/AAAAAAAAABM/CCGEADgu5QQ/s320/bec_peaks_jpg.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To do this, Hau introduced the light into an exotic medium called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) – a quantum mechanical superatom formed when a group of regular atoms merges near absolute zero, as predicted by Einstein and the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in the 1920s. In 1995, Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman, associated with the University of Colorado at Boulder, earned a Nobel Prize in Physics when they achieved the necessary extreme cooling to obtain the first BEC, made of about 2,000 rubidium atoms. Hau understood how passage through a BEC would affect light and created her own BECs for her experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/images/content/about/news_items/simple_schem.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:320px;height:174px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fDeqkC0PEtg/SwSdLfPb4PI/AAAAAAAAABc/WA3U0AUH__Q/s320/simple_schem.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now slowed-down light has became an active research area as part of a new movement toward light-based technology. Devices that use photons instead of electrons have big advantages in efficiency, miniaturization, and bandwidth. Steady progress has been made in creating and using slowed light for computing and data storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In science fiction, the emphasis on the high speed of light has tended to obscure its other fascinating properties. I know of no motion pictures, and only one or two published stories, that explore the possibility of radically decreasing the speed of light; yet, this seems like a perfect opportunity for some stunning movie special effects, especially when joined with the strange and unique properties of the BEC, which is a quantum system observable on a human scale. Maybe it’s time for a science-fiction film that explores the small, slow-moving world of light in a BEC rather than the huge, fast-moving world of space travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers who want to know more about slow light and BECs can find numerous web articles, including my own “Bose-Einstein condensate,” Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2009. &lt;a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74640/Bose-Einstein-condensate"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74640/Bose-Einstein-condensate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My website is &lt;a href="http://www.sidneyperkowitz.net/"&gt;http://www.sidneyperkowitz.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-4326066233012467309?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It favorably changes the operation of mitochondria, and based on the effects of other genes and proteins involved in these mechanisms, I would expect enhanced expression of PCG-1alpha to have at least some modest beneficial effect on life span. That said, I'm not aware of any life span studies involving PCG-1alpha manipulation, but there is a fair amount of published research out there on its more immediate effects. For a longer introduction, including some explanation as to why mitochondria are so important to aging and longevity, you might look back in the archives. Every gene and protein in the regulatory networks surrounding mitochondrial operation potentially determines some portion of the rate at which an individual ages: Our understanding of the complexity of signalling pathways to and from the mitochondria is increasing, describing a network through which mitochondria may communicate functional status to the nucleus to impact cellular function. Metabolic reprogramming by CR may be central to the mechanism of lifespan extension, where changes......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From (shudder!) mercola.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Anthony Morris, a distinguished virologist and former Chief Vaccine Office at the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA), states that "There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza" and that "The producers of these vaccines know they are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And in November 2007, the UK newspaper The Scotsman, made public warnings by the inventor of the "flu jab," Dr. Graeme Laver.

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Laver was a major Australian scientist involved in the invention of a flu vaccine, in addition to playing a leading scientific role in the discovery of anti-flu drugs. He went on record as saying the vaccine he helped to create was ineffective and [that] natural infection with the flu was safer.

Then one of the hipsters asked the bartender for a couple of "PBR's"  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"PBR," I thought.  That must be the hip new drink.  And silly me, I'm sitting here drinking my very unhip oatmeal stout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the bartender handed over two tallboy cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon and I almost choked on the stout.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But apparently it is true.  Pabst is hip.  At least, according to the recently issued &lt;a href="http://www.catbirdseat.org/catbirdseat/bingo.html"&gt;Hipster Bingo Card. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/pabst_blue_ribbon_is_hip.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/rtGs2mzLfvg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258598703744"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/skepticon_ii.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9da36da86a213f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Skepticon II</title><published>2009-11-19T00:33:13Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T00:33:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/evJpCud3mGg/skepticon_ii.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/skepticon_ii.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/11/skepticon.jpeg" width="400" height="173" alt="skepticon.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s another travel day for me tomorrow — I&amp;#39;m off to &lt;a href="http://skepticon.broadcast44.com/"&gt;Skepticon II&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Missouri, where I'll be joining a whole &lt;a href="http://broadcast44.com/FSM/schedule.html"&gt;group of interesting people&lt;/a&gt;. I notice I'm going to be giving &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; talks (hey, JT, nice surprise!), which shouldn't be a problem. The first one is going to be important: I'll be announcing the amazing atheist speciation event that has gone on without our knowing it, and afterwards we have to run off and breed madly, since obviously the only way an intellectual movement can expand is by brute force proliferative procreation. It should be fun! Now don't you wish you'd registered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to think about what I'm going to say for the second talk. Maybe I should just spend an hour introducing &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/"&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who gets to bring down the curtain on the whole affair. Otherwise, I'll just throw together a few slides and do an impromptu godless science talk. That's always easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/skepticon_ii.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/evJpCud3mGg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258597880611"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-1118261992447866860">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d13a0ff8ae792ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Everybody Must Get Stoned</title><published>2009-11-19T01:47:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-19T01:47:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/11/everybody-must-get-stoned.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">What century is this again?

She then appeared in the comments section with a link to her own &lt;a href="http://femomhist.blogspot.com/"&gt;brand spanking new blog&lt;/a&gt;.  I buzzed over there to check it out and I LOVE IT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;feMOMhist is a liberal arts professor who has apparently been "bringin' it since 1968, albeit with increasing levels of artifice."   Her first post describes the inner dual identity turmoil many of us can relate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;MOM sandwiched in the middle of my other identities
MOM pulled between the poles of my identity
MOM holding the two together (the greatest feminist challenge I have faced so far that surprisingly had made me a better historian)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her second post, feMOMhist describes volunteering to help her son's teacher teach the "pilgrim and indian" story of Thanksgiving with a bit more historical accuracy.  She &lt;a href="http://femomhist.blogspot.com/2009/11/femomhist-does-kindergarten.html"&gt;writes hilariously&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I joked to little feMOMhist-son's teacher that the sole memory of my kindergarten Thanksgiving lesson was making butter, she seized upon the idea, apparently missing my irony. Thus, we will be shaking cream until it becomes butter and slatering it on cornbread that will undoubtedly taste better than the Pilgrim's food (note thus far little feMOMhist-son has been most impressed by the Pilgrims' lack of sugar). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And her third post is about recent &lt;a href="http://femomhist.blogspot.com/2009/11/lost-art-of-gratitude.html"&gt;interactions with faculty&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fab book by my man Alexander McCall Smith, but also a truthful statement. feMOMhist is sitting in a meeting now where several "people" have been thanked, but not by name. WTF? feMOMhist toils in relative obscurity and definite penury, but gratitude is FREE. So MAN UP and offer recognition by NAME people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her fourth post is a "femmage" to me.  How can I not love that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be watching this little muffin.  I think she may be destined for great things around these parts.&lt;br&gt;

Carl Phillips suggests in his paper in the Harm Reduction Journal this month that smoking for just one month is more dangerous than switching to a smokeless nicotine product for a lifetime.

&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;

Take a moment to take a deep drag on a few breathtaking statistics.

Across the world approximately 1.3 billion people use tobacco products and by 2030 it is estimated that 10 million people will die annually from smoking-related diseases and 70% of these deaths will be in developing countries. We’ve known about the harmful effects of smoking for over 50 years and yet over that same period 6 million Britons have died of tobacco-related disease.

It’s no secret that it’s hard to stop smoking. Bandolier published an interesting little analysis of trials which included smokers and heroin addicts. They asked: which is the most addictive?  In a rather elegant twist they looked at the cessation rates in the placebo arms of all the relevant trials. Cessation rates for smokers were around 8-9% yet for opiates users were around 43%. No surprises there - smoking is extraordinarily difficult to stop. Even in those that are highly motivated 12 month cessation rates are often no better than 10%. Opposing a harm reduction approach might be doing a grave disservice to those that just find it too tough to stop.

I am intrigued by the concept of tobacco harm reduction - not least because it requires a considerable effort of will to put aside a pathological distrust of Big Tobacco. Some of this post is taken from one I posted over at doc2doc a few months ago. The very first comment on the blogpost at doc2doc sums up the gut reaction of many doctors:

I think we should dismiss this out of hand! This argument is like low tar cigarettes are healthier..so you can smoke more of them. There is no such things as a safe(r) cigarette. The safer cigarette makes no sense given my understanding of how nicotine receptors work, not to say addiction. Do not trust Big Tobacco who have a vested interest in not losing their customers.

End of. Decision made. One suspects that the notion of smokeless nicotine products is simply not endorsable by the scientific orthodoxy in any shape or form. Phillips addresses all the arguments and using a back of a fag packet (though he prefers an envelope) calculation suggests that:

Whatever the explanation for it, the present analysis shows that anti-THR [tobacco harm reduction] activism is deadly. Hiding THR from smokers, waiting for them to decide to quite entirely or waiting for a new anti-smoking magic bullet, causes the deaths of more smokers every month than a lifetime using low-risk nicotine products ever could.

If you are inclined to read the paper then flick to the back first and read the competing interests statement. Not for our Carl a bland &amp;#39;nothing to declare&amp;#39; and instead it reads like a heartfelt plea that we pause, ignore the gut reaction and consider the evidence.  It also speaks volumes for the ignominious role of mavericks in the scientific world; they may occasionally be lauded as heroes but more often they will be squeezed out of funding, shunned at the peer-review review stage and ostracised by their own community.

Within the wider medical community tobacco harm reduction remains an exercise in thinking the unthinkable. Doctors recommending it may be vilified and it opens up a researcher to accusations of acting as an industry patsy; labelled as a dull-eyed lackey in the pay of malignant giants. Yet it could save millions of lives and it certainly merits wider debate.

I mean, come on, here are Christian people who claim to believe the Bible is divine guidance for all of life, ethics, and salvation.  They claim atheists do not have such a standard and that theirs is firm as a rock.  With such a standard you’d actually think that Christians all over the world would see things fairly uniformly, whether it’s the Russian Orthodox Church, or the Black Southern Churches; whether it’s the Lutheran Church of Germany, or Roman Catholics of Italy; whether it’s the Episcopal Church in England, or the Amish in Northern Indiana.   There are Methodists, Disciples of Christ/Church of Christ Churches, Reformed Churches, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Assemblies of God, and a host of smaller groups including many groups that some others would call cults, like the Seventh Day Adventists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Moonies.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But let me just stick to Evangelical Christianity here in America.  After all, they claim to believe in the inspired, infallible and even inerrant Word of God, and they live in the same country.  How goes the unity that Jesus prayed for them (John 17:21), or that Paul demanded (I Corinthians 1:10)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several major dividing denominational issues, which cause splits in the local churches.  Some of these issues include, the role of women in the church, the nature of charismatic gifts, the nature of the Bible, the issue of soteriology and sanctification, Calvinistic predestination/election, eschatology, church polity, and of course many ethical, political and social issues, like the war in Iraq, capital punishment, the separation of church and state, euthanasia, and even abortion and cloning. &lt;strong&gt;So what do you make of this phenomena among Evangelicals who have the only sure revelation from God?&lt;/strong&gt;  What's wrong with this picture?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can the Christian explain this situation, since he or she believes in the Holy Spirit's guidance?  Where's that guidance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted 2/13/06&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-113984324264665984?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking kills millions of people every year and yet the medical community seems pathologically opposed to any measure to tackle the issue other than through the promotion of total abstinence.  Carl Phillips suggests in &lt;a href="http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/6/1/29"&gt;his paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/"&gt;Harm Reduction Journal&lt;/a&gt; this month that smoking for just one month is more dangerous than switching to a smokeless nicotine product for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take a moment to take a deep drag on a few breathtaking statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world approximately 1.3 billion people use tobacco products and by 2030 it is estimated that 10 million people will die annually from smoking-related diseases and 70% of these deaths will be in developing countries. We’ve known about the harmful effects of smoking for over 50 years and yet over that same period 6 million Britons have died of tobacco-related disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that it’s hard to stop smoking. Bandolier published an&lt;a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/druga/MostA.html"&gt; interesting little analysis of trials&lt;/a&gt; which included smokers and heroin addicts. They asked: which is the most addictive?  In a rather elegant twist they looked at the cessation rates in the placebo arms of all the relevant trials. Cessation rates for smokers were around 8-9% yet for opiates users were around 43%. No surprises there - smoking is extraordinarily difficult to stop. Even in those that are highly motivated 12 month cessation rates are often no better than 10%. Opposing a harm reduction approach might be doing a grave disservice to those that just find it too tough to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am intrigued by the concept of tobacco harm reduction - not least because it requires a considerable effort of will to put aside a pathological distrust of Big Tobacco. Some of this post is taken from one &lt;a href="http://doc2doc.bmj.com/blogs.html?plckBlogId=Blog:15d27772-5908-4452-9411-8eef67833d66&amp;amp;plckController=Blog&amp;amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;amp;userId=15d27772-5908-4452-9411-8eef67833d66&amp;amp;plckPostId=Blog:15d27772-5908-4452-9411-8eef67833d66Post:850ff13a-988e-4c1b-9202-834b13726398&amp;amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;amp;plckElementId=blogDest"&gt;I posted&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href="http://doc2doc.bmj.com"&gt;doc2doc&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago. The very first comment on the blogpost at doc2doc sums up the gut reaction of many doctors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we should dismiss this out of hand! This argument is like low tar cigarettes are healthier..so you can smoke more of them. There is no such things as a safe(r) cigarette. The safer cigarette makes no sense given my understanding of how nicotine receptors work, not to say addiction. Do not trust Big Tobacco who have a vested interest in not losing their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of. Decision made. One suspects that the notion of smokeless nicotine products is simply not endorsable by the scientific orthodoxy in any shape or form. Phillips addresses all the arguments and using a back of a fag packet (though he prefers an envelope) calculation suggests that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the explanation for it, the present analysis shows that anti-THR [tobacco harm reduction] activism is deadly. Hiding THR from smokers, waiting for them to decide to quite entirely or waiting for a new anti-smoking magic bullet, causes the deaths of more smokers every month than a lifetime using low-risk nicotine products ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are inclined to read the paper then flick to the back first and read the competing interests statement. Not for our Carl a bland 'nothing to declare' and instead it reads like a heartfelt plea that we pause, ignore the gut reaction and consider the evidence.  It also speaks volumes for the ignominious role of mavericks in the scientific world; they may occasionally be lauded as heroes but more often they will be squeezed out of funding, shunned at the peer-review review stage and ostracised by their own community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the wider medical community tobacco harm reduction remains an exercise in thinking the unthinkable. Doctors recommending it may be vilified and it opens up a researcher to accusations of acting as an industry patsy; labelled as a dull-eyed lackey in the pay of malignant giants. Yet it could save millions of lives and it certainly merits wider debate.&lt;/p&gt;

This was based on an article in the New York Times, and the word has now spread far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptic, physician, and journalist Ben Goldacre wrote about it in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/nov/14/bad-science-iraq-ben-goldacre"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and Graeme Wood did so as well for &lt;a href="http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/graeme_wood/2009/11/superstition_at_the_checkpoints.php"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;It made a brief appearance on TV, too, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#33629480"&gt;in this segment on the Rachel Maddow Show&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she mentioned friend of the JREF Hal Bidlack by name! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard some rumors — as yet unsubstantiated but encouraging — that members of the U.S. government have taken an interest in this story, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this all shows is that we need to stand up to nonsense and call it out, letting others know when they believe in garbage… especially when it will lead to people getting killed. If enough of us do it, then maybe, just maybe, we can get something done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently they “link only to permanent institutional websites” to prevent broken links to fly-by-night pages.  Nevertheless, they link to Ray Comfort’s site, Funny or Die, Youtube, and various others that are not permanent institutions as far as I can see.  Given that EZ is a free educational resource created by an evolutionary biologist who also happens to be Associate Editor of &lt;em&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/em&gt; (which they link to), you’d think they might have been more receptive.  But that’s ok, they can focus on making fun of Kirk and Ray rather than drawing attention to actual resources if they like.  I have to say I’m pretty disappointed in the NCSE on this one, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking kills millions of people every year and yet the medical community seems pathologically opposed to any measure to tackle the issue other than through the promotion of total abstinence.  Carl Phillips suggests in &lt;a href="http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/6/1/29"&gt;his paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/"&gt;Harm Reduction Journal&lt;/a&gt; this month that smoking for just one month is more dangerous than switching to a smokeless nicotine product for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

Current at the &lt;a href="http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~theory/cospa2009/Home.html"&gt;CosPA&lt;/a&gt; conference in Melbourne, after spending a couple of days in Sydney — a brief fling through Adelaide up next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a mixed bag so far; while I’ve had great fun interacting with people here in Australia, I’ve also been struggling with a nasty cold I picked up on the flight over.  Spent yesterday mostly in bed, too fogged up to even work on my talk for Friday.  But when I’ve had the strength to be up and about, it’s been a treat.  Here’s an iPhone snap of the University of Sydney; that clocktower in the middle houses, appropriately enough, the &lt;a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/"&gt;Centre for Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/11/usyd.jpg" alt="usyd" title="usyd" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of civilization that hasn’t quite caught on in these parts is affordable internet access in hotel rooms, so don’t expect a lot of blogging over the next week or two.  Instead, I can point you to a couple of recent videos.  One is an extended interview for &lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/carroll09/carroll09_index.html"&gt;Why Does the Universe Look the Way it Does?&lt;/a&gt;  It is an interview (presented in text and video), not a carefully pre-planned document, so not all thoughts are arranged as elegantly as one might like.  Here is some of the flavor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in a very unusual situation in the history of science where physics has become slightly a victim of its own success. We have theories that fit the data, which is a terrible thing to have when you are a theoretical physicist. You want to be the one who invents those theories, but you don’t want to live in a world where those theories have already been invented because then it becomes harder to improve upon them when they just fit the data. What you want are anomalies given to us by the data that we don’t know how to explain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is a panel discussion on &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/video/time-since-einstein-full"&gt;Time Since Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, from the World Science Festival.  As the description there says, it features Roger Penrose, David Albert, and some other people it  would be too exhausting to list individually.  Here’s part 1 of 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D6435742%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=300" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

It’s a group blog with skeptics participating from all over the Great White North. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just posted a very good slamming of &lt;a href="http://www.skepticnorth.com/2009/11/magician-prescriptions-ontario-poised.html"&gt;the nonsense that is naturopathy&lt;/a&gt;, and if they continue to post such thorough and straight-forward articles, they’ll be a great force for the side of good.&lt;/p&gt;

Hearing that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php"&gt;his minions were giving them out a day early&lt;/a&gt;, I swung by MIT and scoped out the places where I figured they might set up.  No luck finding the Bananamobile itself, but a few copies had been left in the Student Center by, it appears, students who picked them up and then decided they didn't care.  I asked the young woman sitting next to one such copy where it'd come from, and she said that it had been discarded there, but that the people giving them away had been stationed on Mass[achusetts] Ave[nue].  Not seeing them on my second look up and down the street, I figured they'd moved camp before my arrival, so I hopped on the No. 1 bus to head towards work.  Getting off at Harvard Yard, I saw an older fellow sitting against the brick wall, reading the Comfort-addled &lt;i&gt;Origin.&lt;/i&gt;  I asked where he'd found it, and &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; said that this one had been left behind.  It even came with the "Will you go to Heaven when you die?" bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man at the bus stop said that I could have the copy he'd found.  "I've read the &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/analysis.php"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;," he said.  "It's. . . far-fetched."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to work and showed my scientist colleagues my finds, they said that my reaction to Comfort's Introduction would make great performance art.  "Wrong," I said.  "Wrong!" I exclaimed.  "Ach, my brain!  This has more fallacies than it has sentences!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pick only those stupidities which I found upon opening the Introduction to random pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To ponder how DNA's amazing structure could have come together by sheer accident is indeed amazing, and has even led some to consider the possibility of design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Comfort has yet to grasp what &lt;i&gt;selection&lt;/i&gt; means.  He goes on to complain that mutations can't increase the information content of a genome.  He quotes the &lt;a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/mutations_07"&gt;Understanding Evolution&lt;/a&gt; website as saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful for the organism, but &lt;b&gt;mutations do not "try" to supply what the organism "needs."&lt;/b&gt; Factors in the environment may influence the rate of mutation but are not generally thought to influence the direction of mutation. &lt;b&gt;For example, exposure to harmful chemicals may increase the mutation rate, but will not cause more mutations that make the organism resistant to those chemicals. In this respect, mutations are random — whether a particular mutation happens or not is unrelated to how useful that mutation would be.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parts in bold are those actually quoted by Comfort.  The gap in the middle is marked with an ellipsis, but not the one at the beginning.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Comfort thinks this is a &lt;i&gt;problem.&lt;/i&gt;  Because the variation among organisms was there before selection pressure was applied, evolution didn't happen.  Because experiments show that something which is not Darwinian evolution is not happening, Darwinian evolution can't happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think I'm joking?  Here's Comfort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, mutations are not logical adaptations that make a creature better suited for its environment.  They are completely random—the result of mindless, undirected chance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's some serious brain-wrong here.  Comfort's reading in excess of 0.7 &lt;a href="http://www.timecube.com/"&gt;timecubes&lt;/a&gt;, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comfort goes on to claim that hearts couldn&amp;#39;t have evolved before blood, and that blood couldn&amp;#39;t have evolved without a heart to pump it and vessels to pump it through, ergo, Jesus died for your sins.  Now, even in my ninth-grade biology class — taught by a man who&amp;#39;d rather be coaching the basketball team — we &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; cover &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3_cIZqwSfdYC&amp;amp;pg=PA941&amp;amp;dq=open+circulatory+system#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=open%20circulatory%20system&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;open circulatory systems&lt;/a&gt;.  While our coach shied away from teaching the E-word, for fear of provoking angry parents, the evolutionary history of circulatory systems was in the textbook for anyone even mildly curious to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These small samples are insufficient to show just how awful Comfort's Introduction is.  What isn't &lt;a href="http://aigbusted.blogspot.com/2009/11/ray-comfort-plagiarist.html"&gt;plagiarised&lt;/a&gt; is incompetent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/11/score.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~4/KJwGwGTVBy0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/index.xml</id><title type="html">Science After Sunclipse</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258577513931"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=21809">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cdaa0126d6c54afe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Sudhir Venkatesh"/><category term="SuperFreakonomics Book Club"/><title type="html">SuperFreakonomics Book Club: Ask Sudhir Venkatesh About Street Prostitution</title><published>2009-11-18T20:37:05Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T20:37:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/XIV__dZWPCc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/superfreakonomics-book-club-ask-sudhir-venkatesh-about-street-prostitution/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In the first installment of our virtual book club, Emily Oster answered your questions about her research (co-authored with Rob Jensen) which argues that the lives of rural women in India improved on several dimensions thanks to the widespread adoption of television.

Most people don't ever cook turkey.  Turkey is like chicken ... it's a domestic bird that is familiar to all Americans ... but it is very difficult to cook in a way that does not ruin it.  So once a year, you cook this huge bird and try not to ruin it, and invite everybody that is important to you over to see if it worked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this the truth many people have never had good turkey.  They've only had ruined turkey.  And for each of these people, what they think turkey tastes like is unique to the particular way their family's turkey cooker learned to ruin the turkey every year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do you want to know the REAL secret for cooking a turkey?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/more_on_cooking_a_turkey.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/more_on_cooking_a_turkey.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/g66U38zXn1E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258575679600"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=22069">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/897a232487ed01e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Organ donation"/><title type="html">A New Solution to Unemployment?</title><published>2009-11-18T20:53:41Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T20:53:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/_fpScNfuiy8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/a-new-solution-to-unemployment/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We've blogged extensively about the &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/organs/"&gt;serious organ-doner shortage&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and the debate over establishing a market for organs.

The film's premise derives from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon"&gt;popular doomsday prediction&lt;/a&gt; centered on the Mayan calendar. It lasts 5126, at which point the calendar abruptly stops at December 21, 2012. For whatever reason, the Mayans didn't bother to count any further, leading some folks to conclude this denotes the End of the World As We Know. It makes for great entertainment, but what's&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the science behind all this? &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Hz86TsGx3fc%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, 2012 conspiracy theorists have combined the Mayan calendar ending with the notion that global destruction will occur when the legendary Planet X crashes into Earth. Astronomers were intrigued by the possibility in the mid-19th century, shortly after the discovery of Neptune -- they thought it might explain perceived discrepancies in the orbits of the great gas giants. Pluto, discovered in 1930, was initially heralded as Planet X, but it turned out to be too small to effect the orbits of the gas giants. Heck, it's not even technically a planet any more. (There is a dwarf planet called Eris just beyond Pluto, but it's in a stable orbit and isn't going to crash into Earth.)&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because you can never cram too many crazy ideas into a single Disaster Hoax, there are some people who believe Planet X is actually the mythical Nibiru, supposedly known to ancient Sumerians, which has a highly elliptical orbit and passes into our solar system every 3600 years. Earth itself, according to this crackpot theory, was created from a collision between Nibiru and some other object in the asteroid belt. Nibiru also doubles as a "spaceship" of sorts, in that an alien race supposedly traveled to Earth during one of its passes and founded the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there isn't a shred of scientific evidence for any of this. Take it fromNeil de Grasse Tyson, who punctures the myth with typical good humor in the clip below. That doesn't mean we won't thrill to the sight of a cinematic end of the world, because who doesn't love a good disaster flick now and then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's definitely technology related to the blockbuster film. Sony Pictures &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS129712+27-Oct-2009+PRN20091027"&gt;joined forces&lt;/a&gt; with D-Box Technologies to show 2012 with the D-BOX motion technology in a limited number of theaters. So lucky audience members will not only watch the movie, but also experience it physically since the D-BOX technology creates realistic motion effects frame by frame, in sync with the actual film.  Probably not a good option for anyone suffering from motion sickness, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7777837428020010553?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But my girlfriend loves Laurell K. Hamilton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night she was reading Laura's blog and I happened to &lt;a href="http://blog.laurellkhamilton.org/index.php/site/merry_and_the_disillusioned_princess/"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt; over her shoulder:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;First sign we were in trouble other than the on-going mismatch on sex was when he came home from work with this little announcement. That one of his coworkers had told him the man is the head of the household and that women are not equal in the eyes of God. He quoted scripture at me. We were both good little Epsicopalians at this point, may I add. He made these awful announcements and somehow thought that would make him win all the "discussions" we’d been having about the Bible and church, and I know realize looking back he was also trying to assert some kind of authority over me, in the marriage. My reply to him, "If that’s really what the Bible says, and really what God means, that being a woman isn’t as good as being a man then I can’t be Christian anymore." Not what he expected me to say. I’d never seen him back-pedal so hard in our first year of marriage. He basically said, his friend could be wrong and the Bible verses were open to interrprutation.

It was great to hear from the great man in such an intimate setting–particularly about his pioneering work on understanding the origins and nature of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, we also heard from Chomsky on politics–and this forced me to reflect (as I haven’t in some time) on just how far I am from being able to accept his radical, anti-corporate, anti-establishment positions. I do see a modicum of truth to all of them. But again and again, they’re taken so far that Chomsky loses me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, let me explain my basic politics. I’ve always been a liberal, but never a radical. I’ve written at various times for &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt;, spanning the spectrum of the mainline political left magazines–and I’ve also occasionally crossed over and written for &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout, I’ve felt that I can have a valuable dialogue with readers of all of these magazines, and that all of them have serious things to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially with the &lt;em&gt;New Republic &lt;/em&gt;crowd, but also in liberalism generally, there has been a distaste for the Chomskyite view, which runs something like this: wealthy, powerful interests systematically conspire to keep us down and themselves up. They trick us through the brainwashing of public relations and advertising into wanting their products. They financially enslave us through college loans and credit cards and an inequitable healthcare system and unfair tax structures. And they sell us unethical wars–again through what are fundamentally marketing campaigns–that only serve to preserve existing power structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this view, as I understand it, there is really no major difference between Democrats and Republicans. Both parties are similarly licking the feet of the real folks in power, the rich and the corporate. In our seminar, Chomsky even criticized Obama’s historic election, writing it off as the greatest of marketing campaigns, and so likening it to corporate brainwashing triumphs like getting us to smoke cigarettes or want Macs.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chomsky’s position, there is always a grain of truth. But there is also, I feel, a lack of nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, let’s talk about marketing. There is no doubt that it works, because human beings aren’t fundamentally rational, or at least not all the time. Appeals to the emotions, to desires for comfort and security and, yes, sex, really get to us. It doesn’t take a genius to figure this out, and so advertising companies have increasingly perfected the art of getting us to want things we don’t need. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my problem with the Chomskyite view is that I find it strangely unrealistic when confronted with these realities. The idea seems to be that we ought to liberate ourselves from all the brainwashing and cram it all back down the PR agencies’ craws. But this just isn’t going to happen. Once again, people aren’t rational, they don’t have time to fully research every choice they make in their lives, or to critically examine every mass media message they hear, and this isn’t going to change. We’ll always be susceptible to advertising. The answer, then, is to do precisely what Obama did–convey the need for real policy solutions by tying that need, emotionally, to a message of hope, change, and a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see what is wrong with this. In fact, I see a vast amount that is &lt;em&gt;right &lt;/em&gt;with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take the topic of financial inequity and debt enslavement–something which does indeed happen to our best and brightest and most idealistic young  people. You finish college, you want to change the world, and so you take a public interest oriented job. And then reality strikes. You aren’t making enough money. You can barely support a family. Before long, you start wishing you had gone to law school and gotten a corporate job where the Christmas bonuses are much bigger than your current salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this situation sucks–but in response to this problem of material wants, it is my experience that the radical left  preaches an unrealistic, ascetic, self-denying approach that will never work for most people. To some extent, the public interest jobs are poorly paid because there just isn’t enough money; but to some extent, the left actually &lt;em&gt;likes it that way&lt;/em&gt;. It is seen as a mark of virtue to live on almost nothing, working for a PIRG right out of college, courtesy of Ralph Nader. But it is ridiculous to expect that our best minds and greatest talents will consent to carry on in this way throughout their lives like good soldiers, driven by ardor for a cause and continually ready to dutifully clash with the corporate lobbyists who earn three to five to ten times more money annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have repeatedly observed, for instance, that one highly revealing aspect of the Marc Morano problem is his &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/10/marc-moranos-salary-134000/"&gt;comfortable salary&lt;/a&gt;. On our side of the climate debate, philanthropists and universities do not create counter-Moranos who can match him not only in the battlefield of ideas, but in the competition  to earn a good livelihood. And it isn’t &lt;em&gt;merely &lt;/em&gt;that we don’t have as much money on our side of the fence as the corporations do. That may be true, but the fact remains that there is tons of money in foundations and universities, which sport multi-billion dollar endowments or government and state funding. The problem is, we rarely &lt;em&gt;spend that money &lt;/em&gt;in the way that one would do if one actually wanted to win in the battle of ideas. The corporate folks play to win, and that’s why they usually do. The idealists and intellectuals divide their forces, bicker, play to lose, and then exult in the virtue of their cause and the rightness of their ideas even as they fail to make them successful or a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, such is my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally–and last but not least–let’s talk about the “Washington establishment.” I’ve been there. I’ve been a journalist in DC, and I watched how the mainstream left and right alike fell for the Iraq war. I am ashamed to say that I was initially one of those dupes, unfortunately believing along with everyone else the “WMD” lie–although I later I sought to make up for it with it this &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=SlH&amp;amp;q=%22The+Editorial+Pages+and+the+Case+for+War%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;2004 &lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately no longer online) which took to task the editorial pages of our five biggest newspapers for too often beating a drum towards war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that there is something very powerful, and very insidious, about how the “mainstream” can coalesce around a consensus that is &lt;em&gt;wrong &lt;/em&gt;and that trivializes real Chomsky-style dissent until it is too late–especially when everybody is living in an atmosphere of fear (which we were after 9/11, the anthrax attacks, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Chomsky is very much on to something here. But again, what is the solution? To duck out the the game and point fingers from the radical margin? Or to figure out a better way to get more voices heard–a strategy that, once again, is going to require some serious ideas marketing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I choose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really glad we have Noam Chomsky. In a genial way, he states a very strong and uncompromising position that everybody should grapple with and that, again, contains at least a partial truth. But where he doesn’t win the argument, in my view, is when he attacks the system outright, rather than showing us how to work successfully within it for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not going to junk our entire politics or our entire market system. And we are not going to turn people into fully rational creatures who see how advertisers manipulate them and how moneyed interests enslave them, and who are willing to forsake the need for a life of comfort and well-being out of idealism and devotion to a cause. We need to treat people as people, understand their foibles, and then get as much political progress out of them as we possibly can. And in this endeavor, I believe that the Obama way, rather than the Chomsky way, holds the greatest promise for improving our country and our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 18, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Myers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for posting my comments and promising to comment on the questions
I raised. Here is the introduction I gave to your debate with Dr. Jerry
Bergman on the topic, "Should Intelligent Design Be Taught in the Schools?"
on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/i_get_email_47.php"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/i_get_email_47.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of us on the ID side did not think our arguments were clearly
presented, we were pleased with the civil tone and actual intellectual
interaction that took place, just as I asked for below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*****************************************&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Debate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, on behalf of Campus Atheists, Skeptics and Humanists, Christian
Student Fellowship and Twin Cities Creation Science Association, for coming
to this debate which can serve as an example for dealing with explosive
issues in a courteous, intellectual manner. I am Ross Olson, serving on the
Board of TCCSA. I was educated at the University of Minnesota for both
undergraduate and medical school and never heard any evidence against
evolution. It was 10 years later that I discovered a powerful case against
it and I changed my mind, although it took a long time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some will change their mind today, one way or the other, but even
for the vast majority who do not, a new respect for the other side may be
developed. You may be sitting next to those who you consider enemies
tonight. Those of us coming from a Christian perspective know that we are
told to love our enemies. And from my interactions with Nick Wallin, leader
of the Student CASH, I sense that he follows a very similar principle.
A few years ago I was invited to speak at a gathering chaired by Matt Stark,
former head of the Minnesota chapter of the ACLU. Introducing me he said,
"Unlike theists, we do not believe in revelation. So we have to arrive at
truth the hard way; we have to listen to everybody." And they did listen and
of course they questioned and argued, but they did listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will take one of the pre and post debate surveys, fill out the
first section now and the second section at the end. This will help us
evaluate the event. We also hope to have a DVD of the entire debate
available through the sponsoring organizations within a few weeks.
I would now like to introduce Dr. Mark E Borrello, Assistant Professor,
Ecology, Evolution/Behavior, UMN Twin Cities who will introduce the debaters
and explain the format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*****************************************&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Myers, when you do answer my questions, which you refer to as
"creationist fallacies," could I ask you to send a copy to my e-mail
address? I do not have the time to sift through the chaff of the Blog to
find the occasional grains of wheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that the characterization of creationists by Carl Sagan as
"armies of the night," mindless groupies and sycophants, could be applied to
the Blogosphere. I asked you to raise the level of the genre but I get the
impression that you have no desire or intention to do so.
One retired professor began by e-mailing me some barely comprehensible trash
talk in the language of the blog but shifted into normal English and
actually interacted for several exchanges. When he concluded that interlude,
however, he said this, "You are too delusional to continue with...I must
return to PZ's blog to get my sanity back."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I have studied the dialect and can try to speak broken "Blog-talk." Dr.
Myers, you criticized Dr. Bergman's academic credentials and publication
record as a cover-up for insecurity. May I ask you what you have published
in peer-reviewed journals? Or in edited journals? I find many references to
your blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, a blog is not instant peer-review. You would admit -- indeed
insist -- (as did Superman) that you have few peers and that most blog
entries are not even reviewed by the minds of those who post them. The blog
is combination of mutual admiration society with occasional piranha-like
attacks on any outsider who wanders in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Olson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneer harder, little man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I'm not going to mail him a reply. If he can't find this, tough. He made a number of ludicrous claims yesterday in a kind of one paragraph Gish Gallop that I've broken up here, and I'll address each one, briefly, with absolutely no expectation that he'll be able to comprehend the concepts, since he's shown no such capability before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be addressed is your claim that evolution adds information.  That needs to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course evolution adds information: it's a process driven by random variation of a string of information, with subsequent filtering to find viable and more fit variants. My children are not identical to my wife and myself; they contain novel combinations of genes and many new mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll add that development is also a process that adds information. The adult multicellular organism that is PZ Myers is a concentrated node of complex information of much greater volume than the fertilized single-celled zygote that my parents made in 1956. As individuals and as a species, we extract energy and information from our environment to increase our personal information content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your closing remarks about evolutionary research into the beak changes of Darwin's Finches need to be answered with the point that they are still finches and the changes cycle with changing environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, because that point is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you expect, that finches in the Galapagos will evolve into monkeys? Over the timescale examined, they will change slowly, and any changes we see will be incorporated into our concept of the finch clade. This is what evolution &lt;i&gt;predicts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll add that we are seeing &lt;a href="http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-species-of-finch-may-have-evolved.html"&gt;speciation in Darwin's finches&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the latest work shows the emergence of a new finch species in the populations studied by the Grants. This is what we expect: slow shifts over time, punctuated by the separation of populations into emergent species, and they'll all be members of the reptile clade, the bird clade, and the finch clade. They branch, they don't leap categories as creationists demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonsense about how the changes "cycle with changing environmental conditions" is creo-speak for "they didn't change directionally!" Again, that's not what evolution predicts. Populations will drift genetically, and will also to some degree track changes in the environment. That's what was predicted, and that's what was seen in the Galapagos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only point at which the crowd got rowdy was with the mention of evolution's influence on Hitler.  Actually, that issue is not solved by shouting because there is a strong case that the desire to improve the race leads to eugenic and ethnic cleansing policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shouting and disgust with Bergman was prompted by his dishonesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very familiar with these facile and ahistorical attempts to pin the blame for the Holocaust on evolution and atheism. It&amp;#39;s not true; Hitler was a Catholic (I will concede that he was a very bad one, one who was attracted to paganism and who also used religious fervor to support his policies), his horrors were supported by many German churches, and by far the vast majority of the German population — you know, the people who ran the death camps and fought the war — were Catholic and Lutheran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/that_bergman-myers_debate.php#comment-2083061"&gt;Owlmirror&lt;/a&gt; found this very interesting quote in &lt;i&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking about in the garden of Nature, most men have the self-conceit
to think that they know everything; yet almost all are blind to one of
the outstanding principles that Nature employs in her work. This
principle may be called the inner isolation which characterizes each
and every living species on this earth.  Even a superficial glance is
sufficient to show that all the innumerable forms in which the
life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a fundamental
law–one may call it an iron law of Nature–which &lt;b&gt;compels the
various species to keep within the definite limits of their own
life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's creationist thinking; Hitler could have been a baraminologist. Don't try to blame evolutionary biologists for the actions of an obvious creationist, like Hitler. Darwin and Haeckel were not such important influences on Hitler as the creationists would like you to think; far more important was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Stewart_Chamberlain"&gt;Houston Stewart Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;, who basically laid out the entire Nazi philosophy for Adolf — and Chamberlain openly despised evolution. (By the way, my colleague Michael Lackey is writing a book on Hitler&amp;#39;s philosophy, which he argues was actually a theology derived from Chamberlain&amp;#39;s work. Look for it sometime next year, I&amp;#39;ll definitely be posting a review.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, "desire to improve the race" is not a part of evolutionary biology. Some individuals may feel that way, and they may see the tools of biology as useful for carrying out that process, but it's not implicit in the theory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, your claim that morality comes from our culture needs to answer the question, "What if my culture is the Mafia?"  Other evolutionary apologists have candidly pointed out that the only morality that can come out of evolution is that I leave my genes, as many of them as possible, to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your culture is the Mafia, you grow up with Mafia morality. Isn't that obvious? God doesn't step in and zap you with Buddhism, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same with Christians. They are brought up with Christian morality, so their beliefs and biases are a product of their culture, which is no mark of shame, although you wouldn&amp;#39;t know it to hear how they deny it. Similarly, my morality is a product of my culture, which I will freely admit was shaped by Christianity and other influences. We have beliefs that have worked to maintain our society, so they&amp;#39;ve been shaped by a kind of natural selection, too — the morality of the Bible has evolved over time. Again, they hate to admit it, because that would be an admission that right and wrong aren&amp;#39;t absolute…but Christian morality is itself a testimony to that fact.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, a truly interactive academic blog would allow posting of the studies on the academic success of students exposed to both evolution and intelligent design.  You have consistently claimed that those students who do not get pure evolution will fail, but without offering any experimental or observational data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, they will fail my classes, obviously. I ask questions about radiometric dating methods, about allele distributions in populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and about the effects of the environment on the frequency of traits in a population. If you can't answer those, you'll fail biology courses. It's a truism, like pointing out that students who can't add will fail basic mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once again, Olson gets the spirit of the idea entirely wrong. Contrary to his claims, I've mentioned repeatedly that creationist students can be quite bright, and the problem is the wasted potential of indoctrinating them into the lies of creationism. I've also had a number of creationist students who not only pass my courses, but do quite well: they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; learn the concepts even if they don&amp;#39;t believe them. The point I made in the debate was not that creationist students were doomed, but they were handicapped — they didn&amp;#39;t get the background that would have been helpful for freshman biology and had to work harder than students who did get the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to claim that evidence against evolution does not represent evidence for intelligent design needs closer analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. It's another stupid claim. Arguing that there are weaknesses in evolution (which are typically bad arguments, anyway, but that's another matter) does not mean that Genesis is right; obviously, there are many other alternatives. Creationists like Olson want to make a badly performed sleight of hand in which they disagree with some minor technical point in the science, and therefore we're supposed to swallow the whole bloated, elaborate theology of Christian fundamentalism instead. Nuh-uh, that's transparently false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a logical dichotomy involved.  Life either has a natural origin or not.  If not, then the origin must come from outside natural mechanisms.  You can claim that we just don't know, but while waiting, need to entertain the possibility that there is a cause outside of nature.  To say there can be no such thing is not a scientific statement or even a logical one but an a priori elimination of one whole field of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there he goes. Don't trust him; he wants an admission that a supernatural agent is merely &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt;, and then he's going to pretend that you've admitted that the entire intricate structure of Christianity is a scientific enterprise. I'm not going to fall for it, and no one else should be that gullible, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not say that there can be no such thing as a supernatural agent; I say that the creationists have not provided any credible evidence for such a thing, which is a very different argument altogether. As I said in the debate, if you want an idea to be scientific, &lt;i&gt;show us the evidence&lt;/i&gt;. It's possible that the elves have been guiding evolution all these years, but it's not a possiblity I have to seriously consider in the absence of evidence for the existence of elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your redefinition of vestigial organs as reduced function may get some traction but is not the way they were presented 100 years ago,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it is precisely the way Darwin presented it. Darwin did not claim that vestigial organs had no function (Bergman's bizarre and erroneous definition) but that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/darwin_and_the_vermiform_appen.php"&gt;the appendix was reduced compared to the homologous organs in non-human relatives&lt;/a&gt;. The word Darwin used was "rudimentary," not "non-functional." The only people redefining terms here are the creationists, and Bergman's peculiar series of bizarre distortions was a perfect example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;but there is no doubt that "Junk DNA' was clearly touted as evolutionary leftovers and delayed the search for function, which was predicted by Intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Olson is spouting complete bullshit here. At the debate, I recommended &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/genomicron/"&gt;T. Ryan Gregory's website, Genomicron&lt;/a&gt;, as a good source for factual information on the history and meaning of junk DNA. You might start with his &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/genomicron/blog/the_best_of_genomicron"&gt;"best of" post&lt;/a&gt;; scroll down to all the links on junk DNA. As he explains, the default view, biased by a strongly adaptationist stance, was that &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/dna_and_diversity/mashing_junk_dna"&gt;all DNA was functional&lt;/a&gt; (creationists thought likewise for different reasons—why would god load up our genomes with junk?). These views did not hold up to scrutiny. The idea that &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/dna_and_diversity/junk_dna_function_and_non_function"&gt;much of our DNA was junk arose from understanding of genetic mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; and was further &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/genomicron/junk_dna_and_the_onion_test"&gt;supported by comparative genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ID predicts that there is little junk in the genome, then ID is wrong. Roughly 95% of the human genome is repetitive sequence, pseudogenes, and random debris. A few percent is coding sequence (not junk), and a somewhat larger percentage is regulatory (also not junk, and never regarded as such — much of the defense of non-junkiness nowadays comes from a bogus appropriation of regulatory DNA as evidence of function, but such regulatory sequences were never part of the &amp;#39;junkome&amp;#39;…to coin an ugly new word that &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jonathan Eisen can scowl at&lt;/a&gt;, righteously, I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of your genome is junk. Get over it. A small part of the non-coding DNA is intensely interesting to biologists, but not because ID had anything to do with predicting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s enough of that. Creationist misrepresentations of science are so ridiculous that you want to slap them down hard, but they also take way too much time to criticize…especially since superficial kooks like Olson love to flit over these claims with so little depth, tossing out a dozen lies instead of addressing a single point with some seriousness, since that would expose their con far too obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was right on one thing: we do make piranha-like attacks on people like him. The implication of that analogy, of course, is that that makes him dead meat ready for shredding. Bon appetit, my ravenous school!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/i_get_email_48.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jtM-hkpVldw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258570234985"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-6748063342808192262">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55ff62930e650367</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="stupidity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">You know it&amp;#39;s bad when Fred Phelps has more of a spine</title><published>2009-11-18T18:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T18:48:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/11/you-know-its-bad-when-fred-phelps-has.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/6748063342808192262/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=6748063342808192262&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Apparently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php"&gt;Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron are switching their edited &lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt; hand out to today&lt;/a&gt; because they're scared of protesters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess they couldn't handle anyone actually directly challenging their BS in front of the ignorant crowds they're hoping to spread their intellectual void to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the very least Fred Phelps (the "God Hates Fags" pastor) doesn't have to cower and hide his protests.

&lt;p&gt;Coming soon to a town near you – healing through the power of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group called The Healing Rooms is spreading its tentacles across the UK. The Starbucks of faith healing, their mission statement is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have a vision to see every town and city in England with at least one Healing Room and many Healing Rooms in larger cities. This is part of a wider vision to see Healing Rooms set in around the world. The first IAHR Healing Room in the UK opened in Halifax, West Yorkshire at the end of January 2003. There are now 50 registered IAHR Healing Rooms in England and if you include those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland the total is 79 Healing Rooms in the UK. Worldwide there are just over 1,000 Healing Rooms in 47 nations all linked together through IAHR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent organisation, the International Association of Healing Rooms is based in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were brought to my attention at work by someone who had seen the glowing article in his local paper, the Wee County News, on 7 October 2009, about a branch opening in Moncrieff Church, Alloa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IAHR claims include the usual gamut of minor afflictions as well as curing cancer, HIV, ME, asbestosis and restoring a liver. Testimonies from the London branch include these cancer cure claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am giving a testimony on behalf of my sister who received her healing from cancer. I used to come to the Healing rooms every week to pray for her when she was diagnosed and to the glory of God she is healed and completely free. I believe that God answers prayers, all we have to do is to ask and I am living proof. There is nothing too difficult for Him and with Him all things are possible. All the doctors in South Africa where she was receiving treatment were completely amazed by her recovery. She has gone for several other check-ups and no tumor is found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was diagnosed with cancer over 11 years ago. In Dec 2005 I had a body scan and was told that there were 3 tiny nodules in my left lung and many lesions throughout the vertebral bodies and pelvis. I have been going to the Healing Rooms for nearly a year and I am very pleased with the result I have today. God is good to me and has answered my prayer. The last report I had was really good and my consultant is very impressed. He told me the body scan showed no evidence of bony metastases. I feel very well in myself and praise God daily. Thank you Jesus, for you are the same yesterday today and forevermore. You are the greatest healer. A big thank you to the Healing room staff for their patience and love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also this oddity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I came on Wednesday evening and the welcome was very loving . I had prayer and my lower back and crushed disc was healed and my right leg grew 1.5 inches and I no longer have any pain. It is so wonderful, no pain, peace at last. God is wonderful, thank you Jesus. I have been so blessed my family relationships have improved and my brother phoned me after 2 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Jesus made this man’s leg grow one and a half inches. That's an observable and quantifiable effect. There is no mention of whether the leg was measured by a doctor before and after prayer, of course. And how nice that Doctor Jesus also got his brother to call. They must have been praying extra hard that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing Rooms also have something called a Prayer Cloth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Acts 19:11-12, it speaks of how cloths (aprons and handkerchiefs) were touched by Peter and Paul and taken back to the sick who were often cured of their ills. It says that "God gave Paul the power to do unusual miracles, so that even when handkerchiefs or cloths that had touched his skin were placed on sick people, they were healed of their diseases, and any evil spirits within them came out." (The New Living Translation) The cloths are anointed with oil and prayed over by our intercessors before we mail them out to you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimonials for this include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prayer cloth was sent to a man in Australia who had Asbestosis, for which there is no cure. When he received the cloth he put it on his chest. On his next visit to the doctor, he was told that all traces of Asbestosis have now gone - he is completely healed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these cloths worked, the NHS would be mighty interested as it would save them an awful lot of money. In fact, why not get rid of all the doctors and nurses and just hire Healing Rooms to service the entire UK? Oh right, you only get healed if your faith is sufficiently strong. That rules out all the non-Christians. Doctor Jesus is a private practitioner. Or maybe it's not part of His Great Plan to cure you. Who knows? He moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Scottish branch claims include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Danny was waiting to go to hospital to have an arm amputated from the elbow as he had no feeling or movement in it and nothing could be done to save the arm. After prayer his hand began to tingle and move and he can now clench his fist and move all his fingers. No amputation will now be needed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will no doubt be using that hand to put against the other one in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are many more testimonies on the American site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do IAHR claim to heal any number of problems through prayer, they also train people to heal. So if you want a new hobby, pop yourself along to one of their centres and you can set up your very own franchise. I'm not sure why you have to go along to the Healing Rooms to get fixed - does Doctor Jesus not make house calls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my Doctor Jesus post about Body of Christ International Ministries, as soon as a claimed cure for cancer is spotted, the alarms go off because such claims are in contravention of the BCAP code of practice 50.27 viz &lt;em&gt;Marketers should not falsely claim that a product is able to cure illness, dysfunction or malformations&lt;/em&gt; and also the Cancer Act 4.1.(a) 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No person shall take any part in the publication of any advertisement—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a)containing an offer to treat any person for cancer, or to prescribe any remedy therefor, or to give any advice in connection with the treatment thereof;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) In this section the expression “advertisement” includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper or other document, and any announcement made orally or by any means of producing or transmitting sounds&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For this and other reasons detailed in my Doctor Jesus post, I have reported them to Trading Standards and the ASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every group making a claim that the ASA rules against, more spring up. They are hydra-headed and the more canny ones make no actionable promises or claims. But it's important to keep chipping away and to publicize the facts about faith healing - that there is NO EVIDENCE AT ALL that it has anything more than a placebo effect at best. That's NO EVIDENCE AT ALL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have faith, then evidence is nothing. Proof is nothing. Facts are nothing. It's a miracle, praise Jesus and pass the collection plate. You can't put a price tag on the Love of God but there's no such thing as a free miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take long to fill in the Advertising Standards Authority complaints form or to send an email to your local Trading Standards office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of eco-campaigners: think global, act local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you'd like to know more about the Alloa branch, you can ring local director Elaine McDonagh on 07742 175 453 or email &lt;a href="mailto:alloa@healingrooms-scotland.com"&gt;alloa@healingrooms-scotland.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They are hosting a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/10/02/2010-global-atheist-convention-in-melbourne-australia/"&gt;global atheist conference&lt;/a&gt; next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, we can add their politicians to the list of &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/rudds-concerns-about-scientology-20091118-ikla.html"&gt;Reasons Australia is Better than Your Country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he has concerns about the Church of Scientology but wants to see what material independent senator Nick Xenophon has before committing to a parliamentary inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Xenophon told Parliament today  there was criminal activity within the church and has called for a Senate inquiry into Scientology’s tax exempt status.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister throwing his voice to the mix is interesting enough, but take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/scientology-cult-is-a-criminal-organisation-20091118-ikoc.html"&gt;the speech Xenophon made&lt;/a&gt; in the Senate yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s blunt, powerful, and another major blow to the Cult of Scientology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What we are seeing is a worldwide pattern of abuse and criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the body of evidence this is not happening by accident; it is happening by design. Scientology is not a religious organisation. It is a criminal organisation that hides behind its so-called religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you believe does not mean you are not accountable for how you behave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also believe the activities of this organisation should be scrutinised by parliament because Australian taxpayers are, in effect, supporting Scientology through its tax-exempt status. I say to all Australians: as you fill in your tax return next July or August, ask yourself how you feel knowing that you are paying tax and yet this criminal organisation is not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is not about religious freedom. In Australia there are no limits on what you can believe. But there are limits on how you can behave. It is called the law, and no one is above it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a profile of courage for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when are some of these politicians also going to go after the Catholic Church for covering up their criminal past (and present)?&lt;/p&gt;

In order to become multicellular, a certain amount of control needs to be exerted over each individual cell, cells can no longer move around, grow, and divide when they want too. Instead they must obey signals from the surrounding environment (including their fellow cells) which tell them what to do. Cancer, like anarchy, is what happens when the control breaks down, and individual cells start growing and dividing regardless.Uncontrolled growth leads to a neoplasm, a large mass of abnormal tissue. These can be benign, and merely exist in the body without causing too many problems, or they can start to become cancerous, invading surrounding tissues, and sometimes entering the bloodstream and spreading to further locations within the body.(Because of this, cancer is primarily a disease of deterministic multicellular organisms. Plants and other non-determinists can get tumours, but tend not to be so badly affected by them, as they are constantly growing anyway)In order to break away from the neoplasm and spread the disease cancer cells must gain motility. Studying how cancer cells move can be difficult in vivo because the conventional method of immuno-histology (which involves taking slices out of a tumour during development then fixing and staining them) prevent movement all together. Newer work has been done using Intravital imaging (shown diagrammatically on the rather cute little picture on the right) , where a fluorescently-labelled tumour is generated in an animal and then observed while the animal is anaesthetised. This gives a perfect in vivo image of what is actually happening inside the living tumour cell, in these images you can see cells moving in real time, and examine how they act under the effects of internal mutations and changes in external conditions.One of the things that this type of imaging revealed was that most of the cells in a tumour don&amp;#39;t move (less than 0.1% tumour cells in vivo/hour). Furthermore, there were two types of movement. Firstly, individual cells, that darted around on their own, fairly quickly and in all directions. Secondly large clumps of cells, that moved relatively slowly, but in the same direction with a more ordered internal microtubular structure.Single celled movementTwo types of movement were first described; mesenchymal and amoeboid. As the main difference between them lies in the speed and number of direction changes it has been suggested that the distinction may be an artifact of different experimental conditions, rather than actual physical difference. The movement (which has been studied extensively in mesenchymal cells as they can be stuck down onto 2D surfaces) is initiated by signals to receptor tyrosine kinases. These turn on the small G-protein, Rac which, among other things, activates Arp2/3 proteins, which control the nucleation of actin subunits. In the diagram above the actin is shown in red, and it is used to generate movement of the cell. As the cell is forcing it&amp;#39;s way through a thick external extracellular matrix (EMC) it also secretes proteases and MMPs to break this down, allowing easier forward movement.Collective cell movement(All images are taken from the reference below, and I&amp;#39;ve included the key for those with an interest in how eukaryote cells hold themselves together)Collective motility is the movement of whole groups of cells, either in clusters or chains. These cells can move between tissues, spreading the tumour (in particular they can get into the lymph system) but they are not normally found in the bloodstream. Interestingly, collective motility is seen when the conditions for single-cell motility have been blocked, suggesting that the rapid-moving single cells are a transient stage in order to get the tumour into the bloodstream. Once it finds a new environment, it reverts back to the less-motile stage, with large clumps of tissue still able to (very slowly) manoeuvre themselves into nearby tissues.---SAHAI, E. (2005).

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the post…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Early detection saves lives.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I started a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a year and a half ago starting out with just this statement? I did it because that is the default assumption and has been so for quite a while. It’s an eminently reasonable-sounding concept that just makes sense. As I pointed out a year and a half ago, though, the question of the benefits of the early detection of cancer is &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;more complicated than you think&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, I’ve written several posts since then on the topic of mammography and breast cancer, the most recent of which I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2249"&gt;posted a mere two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. As studies have been released and my thinking on screening for breast cancer has evolved, regular readers have had a front row seat. Through it all, I hope I’ve managed to convey some of the issues involved in screening for cancer and just how difficult they are. How to screen for breast cancer, at what age to begin screening, and how to balance the benefits, risks, and costs are controversial issues, and that controversy has bubbled up to the surface into the mainstream media and public consciousness over the last year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, all I can say is, “Here we go again”; that is, between downing slugs of ibuprofen for the headaches some controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening are causing many of us in the cancer field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) released &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm"&gt;new recommendations for screening mammography&lt;/a&gt;, which it published in the &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/content/151/10/716.full"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, that have, let me tell you, shaken my specialty to the core. I must admit I was surprised at the recommendations. No, I wasn’t surprised that recommendations to change the ages and intervals recommended for mammographic screening were released. I saw something like this coming based on a series of studies, some of which I’ve discussed right here on this very blog, such as a study suggesting that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=565"&gt;one in three mammographically detected breast cancers are overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; and that as many as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;one in five breast cancers may spontaneously regress&lt;/a&gt;, coupled with evaluations suggesting that the number of lives saved by mammography is not as great as previously thought, such as &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001877.html"&gt;this Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; updated last year. What surprised me is how much of a departure from current mammography guidelines the USPSTF recommendations were and, even more so, that they were released this year. I hadn’t expected recommendations like this this soon. But I have to deal with them, and in doing so I might as well try to help SBM readers understand them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that women need to understand is that these recommendations are for &lt;em&gt;asymptomatic&lt;/em&gt; women at &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; risk for breast cancer undergoing routine screening for breast cancer. They are most assuredly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for women judged to be at high risk due to genetic mutations, strong family history, or other factors resulting in an elevated risk for breast cancer. Neither are these guidelines for women who are not completely asymptomatic. If you’re a woman, particularly if you’re over 40 but not limited to women over 40, and have felt a lump, that lump needs to be evaluated by a physician. Period. Screening by definition is administering a test to an asymptomatic population. These recommendations should not be used as a reason to delay or forego the evaluation of masses or other breast abnormalities. I mention this point &lt;em&gt;ad nauseam&lt;/em&gt; because I sometimes see confusion between screening and diagnostic mammography in discussions of this issue. Again, screening mammography is for asymptomatic women. Diagnostic mammography is for women with a lump or who have been found to have abnormalities on a screening examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing that needs to be understood is that these recommendations do not usurp the current standard of care, although it may seem that way from how they have been portrayed in the press. The &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_2_1x_American_Cancer_Society_Responds_to_Changes_to_USPSTF_Mammography_Guidelines.asp?sitearea=MED"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; and other cancer organizations have not adopted them. That being said, I do rather suspect that the USPSTF guidelines are the first shot in a battle that is likely to change how we screen for mammography. How much our guidelines will change, I doubt that we will know for quite some time. That always leaves the question of what to do in the meantime. For me, that is to adhere with the current standard of care, albeit with perhaps a bit more flexibility for younger women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the discussion to follow will make a lot more sense if I mention right now that the USPSTF grades its levels of evidence using this grading scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a title="USPSTFgrades by David, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4114611789/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2724/4114611789_c310037716.jpg" alt="USPSTFgrades" width="500" height="181"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ranks its level of certainty using this scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a title="levelsofcertainty by David, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4114611829/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/4114611829_ed1b0052dc.jpg" alt="levelsofcertainty" width="500" height="247"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are its recommendations summarized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient’s values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade: C recommendation.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years. (Grade: B recommendation.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (Grade: I Statement.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF recommends against teaching breast self-examination (BSE). (Grade: D recommendation.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination (CBE) beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (Grade: I Statement.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer. (Grade: I Statement.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the summary for patients states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USPSTF found fair evidence that women who have screening mammography die of breast cancer less frequently than women who do not have it, but the benefits minus harms are small for women aged 40 to 49 years. Benefits increase as women age and their risk for breast cancer increases. However, there are relatively few studies of mammography for women aged 75 years or older. The potential harms of mammography include anxiety, procedures, and costs due to false-positive results and receiving a diagnosis and treatment of cancer that never would have surfaced on its own within a woman’s natural life time. They found that the benefit of mammography every 2 years is nearly the same as that of doing it every year, but the harms are likely to be half as common. They found no evidence that self- or clinical examination reduces breast cancer death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two bombshells here. The first is the recommendation against routine screening mammography in women between 40 and 49. That’s the change that’s caused all sorts of controversy. Almost as big a bombshell is the recommendation for screening every other year, rather than every year. Add these two together, and it’s a recipe for confusion and controversy among women. After all, we’ve been recommending for a long time that women undergo mammography beginning at age 40 and then every year thereafter, no ifs, ands, or buts. It was a simple message, easy to transmit to women, easy to understand, simple to promote, although I would point out that it was anything but easy to convince women to undergo regular screening. Fear that it will be harder to persuade women to undergo screening may well be part of the nearly &lt;a href="http://ww5.komen.org/KomenNewsArticle.aspx?id=6442451487"&gt;universally negative reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the recommendation that I’ve seen thus far from advocacy groups such as the Susan J. Komen Foundation and the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_2_1x_American_Cancer_Society_Responds_to_Changes_to_USPSTF_Mammography_Guidelines.asp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. I can understand how these new recommendations could be profoundly confusing to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to understand on what evidence these recommendations are based. It might help if you go back and read a post I wrote a couple of weeks ago that discusses a review of the literature that urged a rethinking of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2249"&gt;screening mammography&lt;/a&gt;. In that article, it was estimated that, for women between the ages of 50 and 70, 838 women have to be screened for over 5,866 screening visits to sayve one life. It often shocks people to hear these sorts of numbers, but they are not beyond the pale for screening programs. More importantly, the USPSTF based its update of its 2002 recommendations on newer studies, including a &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/content/151/10/738.abstract"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the same issue of the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that used several models to estimate breast cancer risk reduction using various screening paradigms, as well as newer randomized clinical trials, such as the Age Study and updated Gothenberg trial data. These models and results are consistent with randomized clinical trial results that indicate that there is a reduction in breast cancer mortality that results from beginning screening at 40 years but the reduction is “modest and less certain than mortality reductions observed from screening women aged 50 to 69 years.” By using data from randomized clinical trials, the USPSTF estimates that averting 1 death from breast cancer requires screening 1,904 women aged 40 to 49 years; 1,339 women aged 50 to 59 years; or 377 women aged 60 to 69 years. As described above, there was little difference in the benefits between screening every year versus screening every other year, but there were considerably more harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USPSTF’s recommendation not to teach breast self-examination (BSE) is another point of controversy. Despite a lot of enthusiasm for the practice, Cochrane Reviews and other evidence have failed to find convincing evidence that routine regular BSE saves lives. I wish it were otherwise, but it appears not to be, even though there are compelling anecdotes out there of women who did find a lump on BSE and it turned out to be cancer. Unfortunately, overall, the evidence to support BSE is weak. On the other hand, even the Cochrane Collaboration, which I have in the past sometimes accused of methodolatry and “nihilism” with respect to screening &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003373.html"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women will continue with breast self-examination or will wish to be taught the technique. We suggest that the lack of supporting evidence from the two major studies should be discussed with these women to enable them to make an informed decision. Women should, however, be aware of any breast changes. It is possible that increased breast awareness may have contributed to the decrease in mortality from breast cancer that has been noted in some countries. Women should, therefore, be encouraged to seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that may be breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, on a purely practical level, I see nothing wrong with women being taught to be aware of how their breasts normally feel and to bring to a physician’s attention any changes that concern them and still encourage that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the harms of screening? First, there are “unnecessary” biopsies. I used quotation marks because we don’t know that the biopsies were unnecessary except in retrospect because our imaging technology is not good enough to differentiate benign from malignant as well as we would like, with as many as 80% of biopsies being negative. Second, as I’ve discussed before, there is a significant rate of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=565"&gt;overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. Overdiagnosis is the detection of tumors that would never lead to life-threatening disease over the lifetime of the woman. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment because, again, we can’t identify which of these diagnosed tumors will and won’t progress; so we have to treat them all. The question then becomes: What is the risk-benefit ratio of screening. For ages 40-49, the analysis of the results by the USPSTF showed a 15% reduction in breast cancer mortality, which was similar to the risk reduction for women aged 50-59 while the risk reduction was 32% for women aged 60-69 However, given the lower incidence of breast cancer in the younger age range and the higher chance of false positives and overdiagnosis, the absolute number of lives saved is much smaller and comes at a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough of all these numbers. For one thing, the supporting articles in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; are rather poorly written (no doubt written by a committee) and make it hard to tease out the clear comparisons of the numbers of women potentially harmed. Rather, what I want to emphasize here is that these new recommendations are a classic example of what happens when the shades of gray that characterize the messy, difficult world of clinical research meet public health policy, where simple messages are needed in order to motivate public acceptance of a screening test. It’s also an example where reasonable researchers and physicians can look at exactly the same evidence for and against screening at different ages and come to different conclusions based on a balancing of the potential benefit versus the cost and potential harms. The USPSTF simply came down on a side more like how many European nations screen for breast cancer. How this all will play out is an open question, because how breast cancer screening ultimately evolves will depend upon how women undergoing screening and we as a society end up deciding how to balance the risks and benefits of screening. It will also be affected by advances in technology and our understanding of the biology of breast cancer. The only prediction I can make is that the standard of care for breast cancer screening will almost certainly change. I doubt it will change all the way to the USPSTF’s new guidelines, but likely it will move in that direction, although I cannot predict how far. In any case, it’s always messy when that happens and leads to blowback. For instance, a professional society to which I belong issued a highly &lt;a href="http://www.breastsurgeons.org/news/article.php?id=57"&gt;embarrassing press release&lt;/a&gt;, a case study in the wrong way to respond to a new set of recommendations like those of the USPSTF. The worst part of this press release was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe these recommendations effectively turn back the clock to pre-mammography days by making the diagnosis of breast cancer occur only when the tumor is large enough to be felt on a physical exam. The Society will continue to advocate for routine annual mammography screening for all women beginning at age 40. Mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality and saves lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this standard, I suppose much of Europe is “pre-mammography,” given that many countries in Europe use guidelines for screening mammography very much like what the USPSTF recommended. Nothing in the guidelines even suggests going back to those days. Reasonable physicians and scientists can disagree over whether the new guidelines represent a defensible attempt to apply current evidence about screening mammography to public health policy, but demonizing the USPSTF’s recommendations with such inflammatory language is neither productive nor reasonable. If you’re going to argue against the new guidelines, at least try to argue the evidence and counter what the guidelines actually say, as the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_2_1x_American_Cancer_Society_Responds_to_Changes_to_USPSTF_Mammography_Guidelines.asp?sitearea=MED"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USPSTF says that screening 1,339 women in their 50s to save one life makes screening worthwhile in that age group. Yet USPSTF also says screening 1,904 women ages 40 to 49 in order to save one life is not worthwhile. The American Cancer Society feels that in both cases, the lifesaving benefits of screening outweigh any potential harms. Surveys of women show that they are aware of these limitations, and also place high value on detecting breast cancer early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With its new recommendations, the USPSTF is essentially telling women that mammography at age 40 to 49 saves lives; just not enough of them. The task force says screening women in their 40s would reduce their risk of death from breast cancer by 15 percent, just as it does for women in their 50s. But because women in their 40s are at lower risk of the disease than women 50 and above, the USPSTF says the actual number of lives saved is not enough to recommend widespread screening. The most recent data show us that approximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in women who were diagnosed in their 40s, and 22 percent occurred in women diagnosed in their 50s. Breast cancer is a serious health problem facing adult women, and mammography is part of our solution beginning at age 40 for average risk women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a far more reasonable and nuanced critique that encapsulates starkly what the issues are. In essence, the ACS agrees with the conclusions of the data used by the USPSTF to support its recommendations but disagrees with the value judgments behind its recommendations to back off on screening in women under 50 and to decrease screening frequency to every other year. However, even the ACS couldn’t resist a little holding back in that it didn’t mention the raw numbers of lives potentially saved in each age group. In any case, I think the response from the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.net/patient/Cancer+News+and+Meetings/Expert+Perspective+on+Cancer+News/Expert+Perspective+from+ASCO+on+Mammography+Screening+for+Breast+Cancer"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt; (ASCO, a society to which I also belong) was much better. It did what I support, namely defending the availability of mammography to women over 40, while suggesting a more personalized approach to screening that represents a reasonable compromise between current screening recommendations that encompasses what the USPSTF has recommended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s recommendations from the USPSTF recognize the value of mammography in reducing breast cancer deaths, affirm the importance of mammography among women aged 50 and older, and emphasize that mammography should be seriously considered in women 40 to 49 after assessment of the risks and benefits. It is therefore of concern that at present more than a third of women who are now recommended for screening are not getting regular mammograms. While the optimal scheduling of regular mammograms is being discussed by experts in the field, ASCO would not want to see any impediments to mammography screening for any woman age 40 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From ASCO’s perspective, the critical message is that all women – beginning at age 40 — should speak with their doctors about mammography to understand the benefits and potential risks, and determine what is best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what it’s really about. The patient and her physician collaboratively determining what is best for her. Indeed, the current recommendations of the USPSTF are no less arbitrarythan previous recommendations for screening. What they reflect are newer studies and a different analysis of the the risk-benefit ratio, in which the more modest benefits of routine mammography in women between ages 40-49 at average risk for breast cancer are judged not to be worth the potential harm caused. Others may look at the same data and decide that the benefits of screening mammography in this age range are worth the potential harms. Individual women may hear the same benefits and risks and decide differently for themselves. Neither view is clearly inherently “right” or “wrong,” and what I hope we should all be able to agree upon is that women should be aware of and understand as much as possible those tradeoffs regardless before deciding upon screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’m not quite buying that these new recommendations are so clearly more “science-based” than the older recommendations when, as the ACS points out, the USPSTF arbitrarily decided that screening 1,300 women to save one life is an acceptable cost but screening 1,900 to save a life is not. I do, however, think that we health care professionals have probably not sufficiently described the potential harms that come from screening in the past, and the controversy surrounding these guidelines is that failure coming home to roost. As I’ve written before, I sincerely hope that better technology and the discovery of new biomarkers can decrease these high numbers by increasing the specificity of mammographic screening and, possibly, even allowing us to identify which mammographically detected tumors don’t need treatment. Indeed, to me, the one advance that could most reduce the potential for overtreatment of image-detected breast cancer would be molecular tests that would accurately allow us to identify accurately the subset of breast cancers that are unlikely ever to progress and threaten the life of the woman. Another advance would be better imaging technology that could more accurately distinguish cancer from non-cancer or achieve the same thing as mammography without compression or radiation, which could lead to greater acceptance of screening. Finally, better biomarkers and tests that allow us to assess more accurately a woman’s true risk of developing breast cancer would permit targeted recommendations tailored to a woman’s individual risk. All of these are being actively researched, some at my own institution, but until such technologies and tests are developed we are left with mammography. As imperfect as it is, it is the best screening tool we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the application of science-based medicine to screening asymptomatic people for disease cannot avoid becoming interwined with a parallel discussion of how to balance risks and benefits, as well as a discussion of values. In the case of breast cancer, starting at 40 appears only to modestly decrease the absolute number of lives lost from breast cancer but at a fairly high cost of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, while screening yearly only increases the detection of breast cancer marginally compared to screening every year, also at a high cost in terms of more biopsies and more overdiagnosis. Whether the cost is judged to be worth it or not has to be evaluated on two levels. First and foremost, what matters is the woman being screened, what she values, and what her tolerance is for paying the price of screening at an earlier age, such as a high risk for overdiagnosis, excessive biopsies, and overtreatment in order to detect cancer earlier versus a relatively low probability of avoiding death from breast cancer as a result of undergoing regular screening. The next level is the public health policy level, where we as a society have to decide what tradeoffs we’re willing to make to save a life that otherwise would have been lost to breast cancer. Although screening programs and recommendations should be based on the best science we currently have, deciding upon the actual cutoffs regarding who is and is not going to be recommended to undergo screening and how often women should be screened unavoidably involves value judgments by those being screened, physicians recommending screening, and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just those value judgments that are driving the debate spawned by the USPSTF recommendations, a debate that is too frequently acrimonious when it doesn’t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the fundagelicals are hoping to get militant, and I don't mean in that same sense that some atheists are called "militant", which generally means "atheists who say something". No, they are organizing and training kids to get out there and fight spiritual warfare. If you're wondering what they could be fighting for, we have som &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/rights/143975/christian_bootcamp_seeks_to_arm_home-schooled_youths_for_%22spiritual_warfare%22"&gt;choice quotes from Rev. Rusty Lee Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the manual for young Jesus warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patriarch is a family ruler. He is the man in charge. Biblical manhood demands men … defend and shield or cover women from injury, evil or oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feminists charge that Christianity promotes a patriarchal religion, which oppresses women and steals their potential. Although it is true that Christianity is patriarchal, the function of true patriarchy is to protect, provide, and care for women and children. Biblical patriarchy is expressed as chivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman can manipulate, dominate and control a man to the point that his manhood is slowly eaten away like a cancer … Too many women seek value by trying to become men, lead as men, and be aggressive as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it's reassuring that they willingly cut their troop strength in half by treating women as servile weaklings who might eat away their manhood. I wonder if "Rusty Thomas" is feeling the effects of a lifetime of subliminal messages every time someone says his name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's vague on the details of the coming War for Christianity, but he is certain about one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with God slaying the animals to cover Adam and Eve after the fall…to the final sacrifice by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, one theme rings true. Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How barbarically bloody-minded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/if_i_were_called_rusty_thomas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/lHGsN7hOP7s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258562806076"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f791ea8b226a760a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Ray has a change in plans</title><published>2009-11-18T16:11:29Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T16:11:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nlRM0tofkuA/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_has_a_change_in_plans.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apparently, because people had plans to counter some of Ray Comfort's &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt; giveaway — which was announced to occur on the 19th — &lt;a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-of-todays-comments.html"&gt;Comfort is giving them away &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Get out and grab yours now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to stroll over to the UMM campus, although I'll be very surprised if any were sent to our very small school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spencerfern.com/"&gt;Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron showed up at UCLA&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds like they flopped hard. I also got this email account from a UCLA student:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They showed up at UCLA today, the Banana Man himself. I am vice president of the
&lt;a href="http://bruinskeptics.org/"&gt;Bruin Alliance of Skeptics and Secularists&lt;/a&gt;. They definitely caught our club off balance.
Comfort chose a bad time to show up though, as the UC Regents are holding a high
tension conference, deciding whether to increase fees for all of UC for everyone. So
emotions were a bit taut already. Several people from BASS and freethinkers who came
out of the woodwork found a box and stood it directly across from the box on which
Comfort and friends chose to proselytize from. Their books disappeared really quickly,
but BASS has been vigilant about handing out the NCSE's bookmarks and "Why Ray
Comfort is Wrong" flyers. I cannot believe that creationist idiot actually chose to come
to UCLA instead of UC Berkeley. Maybe he was afraid of a riot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to &lt;a href="http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.co.uk/"&gt;Boehringer Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, that dream could be a reality in a few years, in the form of the strangely-named &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibanserin"&gt;flibanserin&lt;/a&gt;. But is it the latest wonder-drug or just a glorified sleeping pill? Read on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flibanserin was originally developed as an antidepressant, but in clinical trials against depression it reportedly failed to perform better than placebo. The standard for getting approved as an antidepressant is low, so this is quite an achievement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BBC today described flibanserin as the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8363743.stm"&gt;"Female Viagra"&lt;/a&gt;, which is rather confusing, because it's meant to increase sexual desire, which is one thing Viagra (sidenafil) doesn't do. The reason for the Female Viagra headline is that, as Professor John Thorp says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It's essentially a Viagra-like drug for women in that diminished desire or libido is the most common feminine sexual problem, like erectile dysfunction is in men"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, one in ten women suffer apparently from "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder" (HSDD) as Boehringer Pharmaceuticals helpfully &lt;a href="http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/corporate/news/press_releases/detail.asp?ID=5514"&gt;informs us.&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;i&gt;“As many as two out of every 10 women describe some degree of decreased sexual desire" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1290320.ece"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; Dr Charles de Wet, Boehringer medical director for the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSDD is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoactive_Sexual_Desire_Disorder"&gt;a diagnosis in the DSM-IV&lt;/a&gt;, the American Psychiatric Association's listing of psychiatric illnesses, and it's been recognised as a disorder since 1980. It is not, however, a very popular diagnosis yet. There are only 60,000 Google hits for it, as opposed to 1,600,000 for "major depression" and, er, 90,000 for "neuroskeptic". Odd for a disorder apparently plaguing at least 10% of women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoactive_Sexual_Desire_Disorder#Criticism"&gt;some people say&lt;/a&gt; that it's no more than a label invented by psychiatrists who didn't understand women and then promoted by drug companies in order to sell drugs. This is almost certainly true, but it's also a bit simplistic, because there are people who perceive themselves as suffering from low libido, and if flibanserin really helps them, that's surely a good thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SwP9d3M2jPI/AAAAAAAAAqI/sUEsNbgwF04/s1600/flibanserin.JPG" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SwP9d3M2jPI/AAAAAAAAAqI/sUEsNbgwF04/s200/flibanserin.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How is flibanserin supposed to work? According to a paper on the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12177684"&gt;Pharmacology of Flibanserin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, it's a serotonin receptor 5HT1A agonist and a 5HT2A antagonist. This makes it a kind of cross between the antidepressants &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefazodone"&gt;nefazadone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buspirone"&gt;buspirone&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of these are widely used as antidepressants because they're not considered highly effective. Flibanserin is also a weak dopamine D4 receptor partial agonist. This might underlie its aphrodisiac properties, because drugs which increase dopamine levels are known to enhance motivation and libido (or indeed cause problematic &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19909912"&gt;&lt;i&gt;hyper&lt;/i&gt;sexuality&lt;/a&gt;.) In rats and mice, flibanserin has sedative effects and enhances the effects of other sedatives. It also has antidepressant-like effects in some tests but not all. Drug geeks can click the image on the left for more details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now for the big question - does it actually work? Well, there have been no published clinical trials yet. At all. The trials in depression, where it failed to work, have never been published. Hmm. However, four trials in "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder" were recently completed and the results were presented yesterday at a sexual medicine conference in Europe (&lt;a href="http://www.essm-congress.org/en/local00.html"&gt;ESSM&lt;/a&gt;) in the form of three posters (&lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6588"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6590"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6591"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). The trials were known as - groan - VIOLET, ORCHID, DAISY and DAHLIA. I probably don't have to tell you that they were all funded by Boehringer Pharmaceuticals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main poster is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i style="font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6588"&gt;Efficacy of flibanserin 100 mg qhs as a potential treatment for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in premenopausal women&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;which pools the data from three trials with a total of about 1,400 women. They found that taking flibanserin 100 mg every night had small beneficial effects. Relative to placebo, it increased the number of "satisfying sexual encounters" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;by 0.7 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;per month. It also improved scores on questionnaire measures of sexual function, a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;In any trial like this you have to ask whether there is result cherry-picking going on. Maybe they asked dozens of questions about the women's sex lives, and they're only telling us about the minority where the drug seemed to work? People &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/302/9/977"&gt;often do that&lt;/a&gt; but in this case, the &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?intr=%22Flibanserin%22"&gt;Clinical Trials Register&lt;/a&gt; suggests there was no funny business of that kind. It also shows that there have been no trials using 100mg which weren't included in the poster, so the trials themselves weren't cherry picked either. That's reassuring. But it looks like the effects were only significant when all three trials were pooled - one poster shows the results &lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6590"&gt;of the ORCHID trial alone&lt;/a&gt;, and most were non-significant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SwLR7JoG48I/AAAAAAAAAp4/aYv5QAfpYz0/s1600/flibanserin.JPG" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SwLR7JoG48I/AAAAAAAAAp4/aYv5QAfpYz0/s400/flibanserin.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;What about the side effects? There's &lt;a href="http://www1.essm-congress.org/guest/AbstractView?ABSID=6591"&gt;a whole poster about them&lt;/a&gt;. 100 mg nightly caused 14% of patients to drop out due to side effects, vs 7% of placebo - so 7% of people decided it wasn't worth it. It caused dizziness, nausea, fatigue, somnolence - and bizarrely, also insomnia. 50mg &lt;i&gt;daily&lt;/i&gt; was much worse than 100 mg nightly, which suggests that taking this at night, rather than in the morning, is a good idea. But given what it is meant to treat, you'd want to do that anyway, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;But this leads onto my biggest problem with this data. It's obvious from the side effects data that this drug is a sedative - it makes you tired and sleepy. The animal data show confirm this. It's much more likely to put you to sleep than it is to make you enjoy sex in any given month. Off the top of my head I suspect it's a sedative because it's a 5HT2A antagonist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;Any sedative can increase sexual desire as anyone who has ever been to a bar will know. So whether this drug actually has an aphrodisiac effect, as opposed to just being a sleeping pill, is anyone's guess. To find out, you'd need to compare it to a sleeping pill, say, Valium. Or a couple of glasses of wine. Until someone does that, we don't know if this drug is destined to be the next big thing or a big disappointment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=CNS+drug+reviews&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F12177684&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Pharmacology+of+flibanserin.&amp;amp;rft.issn=1080-563X&amp;amp;rft.date=2002&amp;amp;rft.volume=8&amp;amp;rft.issue=2&amp;amp;rft.spage=117&amp;amp;rft.epage=42&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Borsini+F&amp;amp;rft.au=Evans+K&amp;amp;rft.au=Jason+K&amp;amp;rft.au=Rohde+F&amp;amp;rft.au=Alexander+B&amp;amp;rft.au=Pollentier+S&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CPsychology%2CHealth%2CNeuroscience"&gt;Borsini F, Evans K, Jason K, Rohde F, Alexander B, Pollentier S (2002).

Thanking is a speech act that we all should use more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There are many of us out here who should join Sally in thanking Dell, who was one of those unique individuals who taught multitudes of students and colleagues, even those who were never fortunate enough to sit in his classrooms. He was my inspiration and guiding light when in 1969 I wrote a proposal to the NSF to create and fund a new PhD emphasis in at Georgetown University on the interrelationship between the formal system of language and the ways it interacts with society and culture. Dell was one of the NSF's reviewers and it is not surprising that our new curriculum included the ethnography of communication that he had created and developed. Building on Dell's work as well as that of Bill Labov, we called the new program sociolinguistics, a label that had only recently been used by the late Bill Bright. A few years later, Dell invited me to join the Social Science Research Council's research committee on sociolinguistics, which he so ably chaired, where I got to learn even more from him during those years. He constantly encouraged me, as few others did, to continue trying to apply sociolinguistics to other fields such as education, doctor-patient communication, and law. And a bit later,  while he was still at the University of Pennsylvania, he invited me to become dean of the Graduate School of Education there. I greatly valued the opportunity to work in the same context with him and other linguists there, but the notion of becoming an administrator did not suit me, so I declined his kind offer. Over the years Dell and I have had continuous communication, from discussions at academic meetings to letter writing and brief Christmas card exchanges. I've always considered him my mentor, despite the relatively slight difference between our ages. He was a truly amazing scholar and friend. I will miss him greatly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258560088964"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18319">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42e576134faf8e6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Excuses Religious People Give for God’s Awful Behavior</title><published>2009-11-18T16:00:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T16:00:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/18/excuses-religious-people-give-for-gods-awful-behavior/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August Berkshire&lt;/strong&gt; is the atheist from Minnesota who wrote the really popular list of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/11/30/34-unconvincing-arguments-for-god/"&gt;34 Unconvincing Arguments for God&lt;/a&gt;, a list of arguments made by Christians which don’t hold a lot of water with atheists.  His &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/august_berkshire.JPG"&gt;license plate&lt;/a&gt; also reads ATHEIST &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has just come out with an updated and revised list of &lt;a href="http://augustberkshire.com/2009/11/13/problem-evil-excuses-religious/"&gt;The Problem of Evil: The Top 15 Excuses Religious People Give for the Horrible Behavior of their God&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief explanation along with a couple of items from the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here are “The Top 15 Excuses” religious people give in an attempt to explain away the horrible behavior of the all-powerful, all-loving god they believe exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Unknown greater good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God must commit or allow some evil to accomplish an unknown greater good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doesn’t that limit God’s knowledge and power?  Doesn’t that say that God couldn’t think of a better way to accomplish his goals other than by torturing innocent people?  Until this “greater good” is revealed to us, we are not obliged to accept this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5) God is testing our faith.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil is God’s way of testing our faith, like Job was tested in the Old Testament.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is true, what sense does it make to impose a “loyalty test” on an infant who dies from disease or natural disaster?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want a pamphlet-y version for easy distribution, August has made a &lt;a href="http://augustberkshire.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Problem-of-Evil-Top-15-Excuses-trifold.pdf"&gt;PDF trifold version&lt;/a&gt; available as well!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007758" title=""&gt;Breaking the News or Fueling the Epidemic? Temporal Association between News Media Report Volume and Opioid-Related Mortality&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Historical studies of news media have suggested an association between reporting and increased drug abuse. Period effects for substance use have been documented for different classes of legal and illicit substances, with the suspicion that media publicity may have played major roles in their emergence. Previous analyses have drawn primarily from qualitative evidence; the temporal relationship between media reporting volume and adverse health consequences has not been quantified nationally. We set out to explore whether we could find a quantitative relationship between media reports about prescription opioid abuse and overdose mortality associated with these drugs. We assessed whether increases in news media reports occurred before or after increases in overdose deaths. Our ecological study compared a monthly time series of unintentional poisoning deaths involving short-acting prescription opioid substances, from 1999 to 2005 using multiple cause-of-death data published by the National Center for Health Statistics, to monthly counts of English-language news articles mentioning generic and branded names of prescription opioids obtained from Google News Archives from 1999 to 2005. We estimated the association between media volume and mortality rates by time-lagged regression analyses. There were 24,272 articles and 30,916 deaths involving prescription opioids during the seven-year study period. Nationally, the number of articles mentioning prescription opioids increased dramatically starting in early 2001, following prominent coverage about the nonmedical use of OxyContin. We found a significant association between news reports and deaths, with media reporting preceding fatal opioid poisonings by two to six months and explaining 88% (p&amp;lt;0.0001, df 78) of the variation in mortality. While availability, structural, and individual predispositions are key factors influencing substance use, news reporting may enhance the popularity of psychoactive substances. Albeit ecological in nature, our finding suggests the need for further evaluation of the influence of news media on health. Reporting on prescription opioids conforms to historical patterns of news reporting on other psychoactive substances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007834" title=""&gt;Rhesus Monkeys' Valuation of Vocalizations during a Free-Choice Task&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adaptive behavior requires that animals integrate current and past information with their decision-making. One important type of information is auditory-communication signals (i.e., species-specific vocalizations). Here, we tested how rhesus monkeys incorporate the opportunity to listen to different species-specific vocalizations into their decision-making processes. In particular, we tested how monkeys value these vocalizations relative to the opportunity to get a juice reward. To test this hypothesis, monkeys chose one of two targets to get a varying juice reward; at one of those targets, in addition to the juice reward, a vocalization was presented. By titrating the juice amounts at the two targets, we quantified the relationship between the monkeys' juice choices relative to the opportunity to listen to a vocalization. We found that, rhesus were not willing to give up a large juice reward to listen to vocalizations indicating that, relative to a juice reward, listening to vocalizations has a low value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007852" title=""&gt;The Typical Flight Performance of Blowflies: Measuring the Normal Performance Envelope of Calliphora vicina Using a Novel Corner-Cube Arena&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite a wealth of evidence demonstrating extraordinary maximal performance, little is known about the routine flight performance of insects. We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1.6 m1.6 m1.6 m) corner-cube reflector using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3-dimensional trajectories without the need for synchronisation hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3-dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1.2 ms−1 and 2.3 ms−1, with a maximum of 2.5 ms−1. Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (−2.4 ms−1) almost double the maximum climb rate (1.2 ms−1). Modal turn rate was around 240°s−1, with maximal rates in excess of 1700°s−1. We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum tangential accelerations and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007858" title=""&gt;In-Group Conformity Sustains Different Foraging Traditions in Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus apella)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Decades of research have revealed rich cultural repertoires encompassing multiple traditions in wild great apes, a picture crucially complemented by experimental simulations with captive apes. Studies with wild capuchin monkeys, the most encephalized simian species, have indicated a New World convergence on these cultural phenomena, involving multiple traditions and tool use. However, experimental studies to date are in conflict with such findings in concluding that capuchins, like other monkeys, show minimal capacities for social learning. Here we report a new experimental approach in which the alpha male of each of two groups of capuchins was trained to open an artificial foraging device in a quite different way, using either a slide or lift action, then reunited with his group. In each group a majority of monkeys, 8 of 11 and 13 of 14, subsequently mastered the task. Seventeen of the successful 21 monkeys discovered the alternative action to that seeded in the group, performing it a median of 4 times. Nevertheless, all 21 primarily adopted the technique seeded by their group's alpha male. Median proportions of slide versus lift were 0.96 for the group seeded with slide versus 0. 01 for the group seeded with lift. These results suggest a striking effect of social conformity in learned behavioral techniques, consistent with field reports of capuchin traditions and convergent on the only other species in which such cultural phenomena have been reported, chimpanzees and humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007866" title=""&gt;The Real maccoyii: Identifying Tuna Sushi with DNA Barcodes - Contrasting Characteristic Attributes and Genetic Distances&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The use of DNA barcodes for the identification of described species is one of the least controversial and most promising applications of barcoding. There is no consensus, however, as to what constitutes an appropriate identification standard and most barcoding efforts simply attempt to pair a query sequence with reference sequences and deem identification successful if it falls within the bounds of some pre-established cutoffs using genetic distance. Since the Renaissance, however, most biological classification schemes have relied on the use of diagnostic characters to identify and place species. Here we developed a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I character-based key for the identification of all tuna species of the genus Thunnus, and compared its performance with distance-based measures for identification of 68 samples of tuna sushi purchased from 31 restaurants in Manhattan (New York City) and Denver, Colorado. Both the character-based key and GenBank BLAST successfully identified 100% of the tuna samples, while the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) as well as genetic distance thresholds, and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree building performed poorly in terms of species identification. A piece of tuna sushi has the potential to be an endangered species, a fraud, or a health hazard. All three of these cases were uncovered in this study. Nineteen restaurant establishments were unable to clarify or misrepresented what species they sold. Five out of nine samples sold as a variant of "white tuna" were not albacore (T. alalunga), but escolar (Lepidocybium flavorunneum), a gempylid species banned for sale in Italy and Japan due to health concerns. Nineteen samples were northern bluefin tuna (T. thynnus) or the critically endangered southern bluefin tuna (T. maccoyii), though nine restaurants that sold these species did not state these species on their menus. The Convention on International Trade Endangered Species (CITES) requires that listed species must be identifiable in trade. This research fulfills this requirement for tuna, and supports the nomination of northern bluefin tuna for CITES listing in 2010.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007873" title=""&gt;Nestedness of Ectoparasite-Vertebrate Host Networks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Determining the structure of ectoparasite-host networks will enable disease ecologists to better understand and predict the spread of vector-borne diseases. If these networks have consistent properties, then studying the structure of well-understood networks could lead to extrapolation of these properties to others, including those that support emerging pathogens. Borrowing a quantitative measure of network structure from studies of mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators, we analyzed 29 ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks--including three derived from molecular bloodmeal analysis of mosquito feeding patterns--using measures of nestedness to identify non-random interactions among species. We found significant nestedness in ectoparasite-vertebrate host lists for habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to polar environments. These networks showed non-random patterns of nesting, and did not differ significantly from published estimates of nestedness from mutualistic networks. Mutualistic and antagonistic networks appear to be organized similarly, with generalized ectoparasites interacting with hosts that attract many ectoparasites and more specialized ectoparasites usually interacting with these same "generalized" hosts. This finding has implications for understanding the network dynamics of vector-born pathogens. We suggest that nestedness (rather than random ectoparasite-host associations) can allow rapid transfer of pathogens throughout a network, and expand upon such concepts as the dilution effect, bridge vectors, and host switching in the context of nested ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007836" title=""&gt;Mutations in H5N1 Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin that Confer Binding to Human Tracheal Airway Epithelium&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emergence in 2009 of a swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus as the first pandemic of the 21st Century is a timely reminder of the international public health impact of influenza viruses, even those associated with mild disease. The widespread distribution of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in the avian population has spawned concern that it may give rise to a human influenza pandemic. The mortality rate associated with occasional human infection by H5N1 virus approximates 60%, suggesting that an H5N1 pandemic would be devastating to global health and economy. To date, the H5N1 virus has not acquired the propensity to transmit efficiently between humans. The reasons behind this are unclear, especially given the high mutation rate associated with influenza virus replication. Here we used a panel of recombinant H5 hemagglutinin (HA) variants to demonstrate the potential for H5 HA to bind human airway epithelium, the predominant target tissue for influenza virus infection and spread. While parental H5 HA exhibited limited binding to human tracheal epithelium, introduction of selected mutations converted the binding profile to that of a current human influenza strain HA. Strikingly, these amino-acid changes required multiple simultaneous mutations in the genomes of naturally occurring H5 isolates. Moreover, H5 HAs bearing intermediate sequences failed to bind airway tissues and likely represent mutations that are an evolutionary "dead end." We conclude that, although genetic changes that adapt H5 to human airways can be demonstrated, they may not readily arise during natural virus replication. This genetic barrier limits the likelihood that current H5 viruses will originate a human pandemic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007888" title=""&gt;Genetic Variation and Recent Positive Selection in Worldwide Human Populations: Evidence from Nearly 1 Million SNPs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genome-wide scans of hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have resulted in the identification of new susceptibility variants to common diseases and are providing new insights into the genetic structure and relationships of human populations. Moreover, genome-wide data can be used to search for signals of recent positive selection, thereby providing new insights into the genetic adaptations that occurred as modern humans spread out of Africa and around the world. We genotyped approximately 500,000 SNPs in 255 individuals (5 individuals from each of 51 worldwide populations) from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH). When merged with non-overlapping SNPs typed previously in 250 of these same individuals, the resulting data consist of over 950,000 SNPs. We then analyzed the genetic relationships and ancestry of individuals without assigning them to populations, and we also identified candidate regions of recent positive selection at both the population and regional (continental) level. Our analyses both confirm and extend previous studies; in particular, we highlight the impact of various dispersals, and the role of substructure in Africa, on human genetic diversity. We also identified several novel candidate regions for recent positive selection, and a gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several GO groups that were significantly enriched for such candidate genes, including immunity and defense related genes, sensory perception genes, membrane proteins, signal receptors, lipid binding/metabolism genes, and genes involved in the nervous system. Among the novel candidate genes identified are two genes involved in the thyroid hormone pathway that show signals of selection in African Pygmies that may be related to their short stature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007895" title=""&gt;Extrapair Paternity and Maternity in the Three-Toed Woodpecker, Picoides tridactylus: Insights from Microsatellite-Based Parentage Analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Molecular techniques have revealed that avian mating systems are more diverse and complex than previously thought. We used microsatellite markers to determine genetic parentage, the prevalence of extrapair paternity and quasi-parasitism (i.e. situations where a male's extrapair mate lay in his nest) in a socially monogamous population of three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) in southern Finland. A total of 129 adults and nestlings, representing 5-9 families annually from 2004-2007, were genotyped at up to ten microsatellite loci. The results of genetic assignment tests confirmed that monogamous parentage characterized the majority (84.6%, 22/26) of broods, and that most (93.8%, 75/80) nestlings were the offspring of their social parents. Two of 80 nestlings (2.5%) in two of 26 broods (7.7%) were sired by extrapair males and quasi-parasitism occurred in 3.8% (3/80) of nestlings and 7.7% (2/26) of broods. Hence, the levels of extrapair parentage were low, possibly because both genetic polygyny and polyandry are constrained by the high paternal effort required for parental care. The co-occurrence of low levels of extrapair paternity and quasi-parasitism are discussed in light of ecological and behavioural factors characterizing the species biology.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_215.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/3M80OSsatU8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258557545009"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8218/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c214994b1ececcdc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Breaching a Barrier to Fight Brain Cancer</title><published>2009-11-18T14:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T14:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.8218/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Howard Riina threaded a slender tube through a maze of arteries in Dennis Sugrue's brain, watching X-ray images on a monitor to track his progress.

&lt;p&gt;Remember how I started a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/more_is_not_always_better_mri_and_the_in.php"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a year and a half ago saying just this? I did it because that is the default assumption and has been so for quite a while. It's an eminently reasonable-sounding concept that just makes sense. As I pointed out a year and a half ago, though, the question of the benefits of the early detection of cancer is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/detecting_cancer_early_part_1_more_compl.php"&gt;more complicated than you think&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, I've written several posts since then on the topic of mammography and breast cancer, the most recent of which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/rethinking_cancer_screening.php"&gt;posted just last week&lt;/a&gt;. As studies have been released and my thinking on screening for breast cancer has evolved, regular readers have had a front row seat. Through it all, I hope I've managed to convey some of the issues involved in screening for cancer and just how difficult they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, all I can say is, "Here we go again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) released &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm"&gt;new recommendations for screening mammography&lt;/a&gt;, which it published in the &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/content/151/10/716.full"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, that have, let me tell you, shaken my specialty to the core. I must admit I was surprised at the recommendations. No, I wasn't surprised that recommendations to scale back mammographic screening were released. I saw it coming, based on a series of studies, some of which I've discussed right here on this very blog. What surprised me is how much of a departure from current mammography guidelines the USPSTF recommendations were and, even more so, that they were released this year. I hadn't expected recommendations like this this soon. But I have to deal with them, and so I might as well try to help my readers understand them too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/bV4xh2Y8mck" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258556948729"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-4367152796472364177">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3c76118c2e1b46d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="accomodationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">NCSE's "Don't Diss Darwin" flyer strikes the appropriate "accomodationist" tone</title><published>2009-11-18T14:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T14:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/11/ncses-dont-diss-darwin-flyer-strikes.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">The National Center for Science Education has generated &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/resources/comfort_flyer_final.pdf"&gt;a flyer&lt;/a&gt; to be passed out at college campuses tomorrow in order to counter the distribution of bananaman Ray Comfort's mangled version of &lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;.  I noticed in the flyer that the NCSE strike the perfect tone for "accommodating" the religious in the fight for evolution, while not alienating atheists or making explicit theological statements:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Comfort implies that it is necessary to reject evolution in&lt;br&gt;order to be a good Christian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ironically, although Comfort quotes Francis Collins, the geneticist who led the Human Genome Project and is now in charge of the National Institutes of Health, he fails to mention that Collins is a committed evangelical Christian who accepts evolution!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People of all faiths and of none have accepted evolution on its scientific merits. The fact that Comfort fails to acknowledge this suggests that he is arguing in bad faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right on.  Notice how they never actually say that there is no contradiction between evolution and Christianity (which would be an explicit theological position, and not appropriate to the NCSE's mission statement).  They also put in a positive acknowledgment of atheists ("people of all faiths &lt;i&gt;and of none&lt;/i&gt;"), a la &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm"&gt;Obama's inaugural nod to "non-believers"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is accomodationism done right.  They make only factual statements, not theological or philosophical ones&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  They are inclusive.  And they don't belabor the point.  If this is as far as accomodationism ever went, I would have zero complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;As is often overlooked, prominent "anti-accomodationists" like Jerry Coyne have clearly stated that the NCSE should also not be saying there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a contradiction between faith and science, because that would also constitute of a theological/philosophical position.  Based on the NCSE's mission, they need to stick to the facts -- and the bare facts merely say that there are Christians and other theists who believe in evolution.

Anti-scientific approaches are any that seek to undermine science as the determinant of the standard of care, often overtly advocating for spiritual or subjectively-based standards. Some attack the validity of science itself, usually with post-modernist philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscientific proponents, on the other hand, praise science, they just do it wrong. In reality there is a continuum along a spectrum from complete pseudoscience to pristine science, and no clear demarcation in the middle. Individual studies vary along this spectrum as well – there are different kinds of evidence, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and there are no perfect studies. Further, when evaluating any question in medicine, the literature (the totality of all those individual studies) rarely points uniformly to a single answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These multiple overlapping continua of scientific quality create the potential to make just about any claim seem scientific simply by how the evidence is interpreted. Also, even a modest bias can lead to emphasizing certain pieces of evidence over others, leading to conclusions which seem scientific but are unreliable. Also, proponents can easily begin with a desired conclusion, and then back fill the evidence to suit their needs (rather than allowing the evidence to lead them to a conclusion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine movement systematically endorses any piece of evidence that seems to support the conclusion that there is some correlation between vaccines and neurological injury. Meanwhile, they find ways to dismiss any evidence which fails to show such a connection. They, of course, accuse the scientific community of doing the same thing, and each side cites biases and conflicts in the other to explain the discrepancy. It is no wonder the public is confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, do we use the evidence to arrive at reliable scientific conclusions? That is what I will be discussing in this series of posts, beginning with a discussion of correlation and causation, but here is a quick overview: SBM is achieved through a consideration of scientific plausibility and a systematic review of the clinical evidence. In other words – all scientific evidence is considered in a fair and thorough manner, including basic science and clinical evidence, and placed in the context of what we know about how the world works. Further, we do not rely upon any individual’s systematic review of the evidence, but on the consensus of analysis among experts and institutions – so that any biases are likely to average out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the final continuum – the consensus of expert opinion based upon systematic reviews can either result in a solid and confident unanimous opinion, a reliable opinion with serious minority objections, a genuine controversy with no objective resolution, or simply the conclusion that we currently lack sufficient evidence and do not know the answer. It can also lead, of course, to a solid consensus of expert opinion combined with a fake controversy manufactured by a group driven by ideology or greed and not science. The tobacco industry’s campaign of doubt against the conclusion that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer is one example. The anti-vaccine movement’s fear-mongering about vaccines and autism is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation and Causation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of scientific evidence is based upon a correlation of variables – they tend to occur together. Scientists are careful to point out that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. The assumption that A causes B simply because A correlates with B is a logical fallacy – it is not a legitimate form of argument. However, sometimes people commit the opposite fallacy – dismissing correlation entirely, as if it does not imply causation. This would dismiss a large swath of important scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the tobacco industry abused this fallacy to argue that simply because smoking correlates with lung cancer that does not mean that smoking causes lung cancer. The simple correlation is not enough to arrive at a conclusion of causation, but multiple correlations all triangulating on the conclusion that smoking causes lung cancer, combined with biological plausibility, does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation must always be put into perspective. There are two basic kinds of clinical scientific studies that may provide evidence of correlation – observational and experimental. Experimental studies are ones in which some intervention is given to a study population. In experimental studies it is possible to control for many variables, and even reasonably isolate the variable of interest, and so correlation is a well-designed experimental study is very powerful, and we generally can assume cause and effect. If active treatment vs placebo correlates with a better outcome, then we interpret that as the treatment causing the improved outcome. (”Well-designed” is the key here – a subject of a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In observational studies populations are observed in the real world, but no intervention is being given. Observational studies can be very powerful, because they can look as extremely large numbers of subjects (more than is practical in an experimental study) but the weakness is that all variables cannot be controlled for. Researchers can account for known variables (race, age, and sex are common), but it is always the unknown variables that can confound such studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In observational studies lack of correlation is easier to interpret than a positive correlation – if there is no correlation between A and B then we can pretty much rule out a causal relationship. The only caveat is that a correlation is being obscured by a factor that was not accounted for. When a correlation is found in observational studies – that is when the assumption of cause and effect must be avoided, and more thorough analysis is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If A correlates with B, then A may cause B, B may cause A, A and B may be caused by a common variable C, or the correlation may be a statistical fluke and not “real”. Further studies are then required to confirm the correlation and any specific causal hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the smoking example again – the hypothesis that smoking causes cancer as the causal relationship to explain the correlation raises several predictions, all later confirmed. The duration of smoking increases risk of cancer (a dose response relationship), stopping smoking reduces the risk of cancer, greater intensity of smoking increases risk, and smoking unfiltered vs filtered cigarettes is associated with higher risk. These various correlations only make sense if smoking causes lung cancer. Further, tobacco smoke contains substances demonstrated to be carcinogens – so there is biological plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest abuse of the correlation equals causation fallacy is the assumption of cause and effect from a single anecdotal case. Here we are not talking about an observational study where statistics are brought to bear on hundreds or thousands of subjects, but the uncontrolled observation of a single individual. Such cases are very compelling to the human psyche- we are more moved by stories than statistics. But they make for very weak scientific evidence. This is not to say they are worthless – even a single case can raise the question of a possible correlation. But they cannot be used to establish even that a correlation is real. (Anecdotes generate questions, not answers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again to use the anti-vaccine movement as an example, it is easy to generate fear based upon individual cases of bad outcomes after receiving the vaccine. We are hard-wired to find such events compelling. But such correlations should and do occur on a regular basis, even without any causal factor. Further, it is natural, after a new disease or disorder appears, to think back over any recent events that may explain it. Our minds will latch onto anything that sticks out, and over time our memories will even morph to make the apparent correlation more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;a href="http://noworldsystem.com/2009/11/15/pregnant-women-miscarriage-after-h1n1-vaccine/"&gt;anti-vaccine and conspiracy site &lt;/a&gt;that is essentially collecting anecdotes of correlation between the flu vaccine and miscarriages among women. This goes beyond the assumption of cause and effect from correlation, to the assumption of correlation from anecdote. Common things occur together commonly. Given the number of spontaneous miscarriages, and the number of pregnant women receiving the flu vaccine, we would expect there to be thousands of women who miscarry within 24 hours of receiving the flu vaccine, just be chance alone. So first we have to ask – is this a real correlation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19850275?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=1"&gt;systematic reviews of existing evidence&lt;/a&gt;, is no. There is no apparent risk of adverse outcome in pregnancy from the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media tends to develop a narrative they think will sell, and then that becomes the story they are telling. In the midst of this severe flu season, the narrative the media is telling is of dramatic adverse events following the flu vaccine. These events are always there, because people are always getting sick, and when you vaccinate millions of people, some of them will get sick afterwards by chance alone. Individual stories are therefore misleading – we need statistics on large number of people to arrive at any conclusions. But statistics don’t make headlines – individual stories do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC and the WHO are tracking the statistics as the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccines are rolled out. In the end, these statistics will tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, correlation is an extremely valuable type of scientific evidence in medicine. But first correlations must be confirmed as real, and then every possible causational relationship must be systematically explored. In the end correlation can be used as powerful evidence for a cause and effect relationship between a treatment and benefit, or a risk factor and a disease. But it is also one of the most abused types of evidence, because it is easy and even tempting to come to premature conclusions based upon the preliminary appearance of a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

Fair enough–she has a new book out. But the magazine chose to use a photo originally taken for an August 2009 &lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/photo/sarahpalin/home.html"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;Runners World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;about&lt;span&gt; health and fitness. &lt;em&gt;Runner’s World &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/photo/sarahpalin/"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the picture was provided to &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;without &lt;em&gt;Runners World&lt;/em&gt;’s “knowledge or permission” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;by the photographer’s stock agency. There has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been a good deal of commentary, some &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/11/the-truth-hurts-newsweeks-palin-cover-.html"&gt;glee&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;/span&gt;speculation it was intended to rally conservative support for 2012.&lt;span&gt; But for once, I agree with the former governor. Her statement on mirrors my reaction:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of photo for the cover of this week’s Newsweek is unfortunate. When it comes to Sarah Palin, this “news” magazine has relished focusing on the irrelevant rather than the relevant. &lt;span&gt;The Runner’s World magazine&lt;/span&gt; one-page profile for which this photo was taken was all about &lt;span&gt;health and fitness&lt;/span&gt; — a subject to which I am devoted and which is critically important to this nation. The out-of-context Newsweek approach is sexist and oh-so-expected by now. If anyone can learn anything from it: it shows why you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, gender, or color of skin. The media will do anything to draw attention — even if out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am extremely disappointed in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; for pulling a fraternity-prank-like stunt. Yes, I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2008/09/05/sarah-palin-does-not-speak-for-me/"&gt;strongly disagree with Palin’s political views&lt;/a&gt; about almost everything, but that does not make their decision acceptable. Choosing an out-of-context image is not only dubious, but a manipulative move, unworthy of the magazine. Misrepresentation may indeed sell well, but it comes at the cost of integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the broader context, I am sick of this sexist nonsense. How are we to encourage more women to consider a career in politics when the media casts every female as a ‘pin-up’ or ‘bitch’ with no middle ground? As I’ve written &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/02/24/women-ready-for-office-in-2010/"&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt;, while candidates should never be chosen based on a number of X chromosomes, it would benefit everyone if women became more involved in the decision-making process given we represent about 50% of the population. The way Clinton and Palin were treated in 2008 made Washington seem like a boys club. I often wondered how many girls might be completely turned off to politics by watching the unrelenting onslaught of ogling, sexy photo-shopping, and worse that ensued from across the aisle.

The previous post is available here: Joseph Grinnell, Climate Change and the Legacy of the California Thrasher Joseph Grinnell was THE quintessential field biologist. From the time of his birth in 1877 (or, roughly thereabouts), until his to death in 1939 he marveled at the natural world. He reveled in nature’s aesthetic splendor, and he contemplated its immense mystery. He dedicated his entire life to the field of biology; birds, reptiles, mammals and amphibians – he studied them all, and he did so with great detail.Grinnell’s philosophy of scientific inquiry focused intently on the task of accumulating as much raw data as possible. For example, during the biological survey he carried out in Yosemite National Park between the years 1914 and 1920, Grinnell and his field crews collected 817 photographs, nearly 3000 animal specimens and more than 2000 pages of notes! Being organized and detail oriented is one thing, but Grinnell’s drive for thoroughness approached the obsessive.As testimony to Grinnell’s view on taking accurate field notes, consider the following precept that he was known for continuously repeating as a mantra for meticulousness;“Put it all down. You might not think it’s important, but somebody else may.” (1)It may very well have been the sheer bulk of his available data that guided Joseph Grinnell to develop the concept of the ‘ecological niche’ discussed during the last post in this series (Available HERE). After all, he collected information on everything from the individual behavioral characteristics and morphology of observed animals to the daily weather patterns of Yosemite; all of these informational axes have been incorporated into the ecological niche concept. Even if the ‘niche’ wasn’t born of the data directly, the huge quantity of collected information would certainly have been useful during the writing of Grinnell’s numerous research papers and species descriptions, which are more than 500 in number.Yet greater evidence to Grinnell’s tenacity can be found in the fact that despite his time spent collecting, he still managed to teach and perform administrative duties as the first Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at Berkeley. An absolutely astonishing scientist!In considering Grinnell’s knack for field work, another of his now famous quotes comes to mind. This one (from 1910) relates to the long-term value of the data that he and his colleagues were collecting.“This value will not, however, be realized until the lapse of many years, possibly a century, assuming that our material is safely preserved. And this is that the student of the future will have access to the original record of faunal conditions in California and the West, wherever we now work.”This quote would turn out to be very prophetic…What possible value could be reaped in modern times for century-old data collected during Grinnell’s survey of the ‘Yosemite Tract’? What would comprehensive and weather-correlated descriptions of wildlife niches tell us about contemporary linkages of climate-and-niche?A few steps are required in order to assess the above questions. As an initial step, there would be a need to quantify the climate-to-niche relationships of current systems. Once such modern data was in-hand, comparisons could be made between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ to identify any patterns or inconsistencies. In other words, to gauge change compare Grinnell’s data with what is exhibited by Yosemite’s ecosystems today.This is precisely what the present Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at Berkeley has done. He and his colleagues went to field, and using Grinnell’s notes and methods collected new data for the purpose of comparison. Their resurvey - The Grinnell Project - and findings will be discussed during the next post...1-As told to Ward Russell during a field survey; an audio recording of Ward’s 1992 interview can be found at the MVZ @ Berkeley website – HEREJoseph Grinnell (1917).

She quite rightly urges skepticism, but when looking into ideologic and muddled topic of alternative medicine, skepticism needs to be turned up to &amp;quot;11&amp;quot;. A major complaint that doctors have about health coverage is not the objectivity, earnestness, or research abilities of the reporter but the lack of some of the fundamental knowledge of the subject.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;&amp;quot;Alternative medicine&amp;quot; can mean many things and the National Centers for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) provides &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/overview.htm" style="color:rgb(153,27,30)"&gt;a good starting point.&lt;/a&gt;  Whan many skeptics have pointed out over the years however is that there really is no &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; to medicine; only that which is proven to work, and that which is not.  This is one of the bases for ethical medical practice.  Medicine is full of compelling stories---we physicians hear them every day. But, knowledge of what does and does not work cannot be based on a good story.  The histories we record each day help guide us in treating individuals using interventions tested on larger groups.  The randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is often seen as the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; for testing medical interventions, but there are a two primary limitations to this view.  First, not all interventions can be examined using an RCT due to ethical and technical concerns.  Second, an RCT is often blind to the idea of &amp;quot;plausibility&amp;quot;.  This leaves us open to what &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=225" style="color:rgb(153,27,30)"&gt;Dr. Harriet Hall&lt;/a&gt; has termed &amp;quot;Tooth Fairy Science&amp;quot;:  we can generate statistically significant data about the average price of an incisor, the average time between tooth loss and monetary gain, and other such factors, but none of these numbers tells us whether the Tooth Fairy in fact &lt;i&gt;exists&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;If in reporting on health the goal is to inform as well as tell a good story, an informed skepticism is necessary.  Supporters of alternative medicine are often gripped by a religious-like zeal and may be somewhat deficient in skepticism.  Doctors and scientists are trained to be skeptics (a training that ometimes wears off) and usually start from the premise of &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t believe it, show me the data&amp;quot;.  Ms. Allen&amp;#39;s excellent article lays out some of the problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:30px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;The task of sorting it all out becomes all the harder because evidence for health claims in non-traditional medicine often does not rise to the gold-standard -- randomized, controlled clinical trials (those in which participants are randomly assigned either to an experimental group or to a comparison group) published in major peer-reviewed journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:30px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;"There isn't the same depth of research, and there never will be," says Hardy, medical director of the Simms/Mann-UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology, who has long studied herbs and dietary supplements and often recommends them to appropriate patients. She says safety margins for herbal remedies, especially those used for thousands of years, are better than for prescription drugs. "It's very uncommon that any herb with traditional knowledge behind it will be as toxic as a new drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:30px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;Claims about alternative, complementary and integrative medicine often are built on anecdotal evidence. But that's not the same as demonstrating their effectiveness through rigorous science....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:30px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;When she's trying to evaluate such claims of an alternative remedy's effectiveness, Hardy wants study authors or those making the claims to provide multiple cases of good responses. She also wants to see a rationale for the treatment that is either consistent with the principles of alternative medicine practices, such as traditional Chinese medicine, or explainable through principles of Western medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;This credulous claim by a supporter of alternative medicine deserves careful parsing.  There is no reason that any claim made by alternative medicine cannot be subjected to the same scrutiny as any other intervention.  In fact, it&amp;#39;s done regularly.  &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/palmetto/" style="color:rgb(153,27,30)"&gt;An NCCAM-funded study of Saw Palmetto&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found insufficient evidence to recommend its use.  This wasn&amp;#39;t a set of anecdotes but a randomized-controlled trial, just the sort of &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; that Hardy claims &amp;quot;there never will be&amp;quot; in researching herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;Her next claim that &amp;quot;any herb with traditional knowledge behind it&amp;quot; is unlikely to be as toxic as a new drug&amp;quot; is a &lt;i&gt;non sequitur&lt;/i&gt;. Safety is only one factor to consider in evaluating an intervention---the other, of course, is efficacy.  Something with no physiologic effects at all will not be toxic, by definition.  Something with significant physiologic effects can always have potential toxicities.  Another way of framing it is that there is no such thing as &amp;quot;side effects&amp;quot;---only effects, some desired, some not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;The final disturbing point made by Hardy is that claims should be evaluated via anecdotes that are seen through the lense of alternative medicine principles.  This is a terrible idea.  The evaluation of a medical intervention must rest on its safety and efficacy &lt;i&gt;and its scientific plausibility. &lt;/i&gt;Calling something "alternative" does not render it immune from scientific investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:2px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:2px;margin-left:0px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:12px;text-transform:none"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/covering_alternative_medicine-.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/covering_alternative_medicine-.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/tn94p8bPUrM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258553327791"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/makin_em_sweat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88765b4ad328972d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Makin’ ’em sweat</title><published>2009-11-18T13:18:19Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T13:18:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/tMRiPCNbDik/makin_em_sweat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/makin_em_sweat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Poor Adnan Oktar.

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/11/makin_em_sweat/caddisfly.jpeg" width="300" height="189" alt="caddisfly.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the creationists have produced a &lt;a href="http://tr1.harunyahya.com/Detail/T/EDCRFV/productId/18849/"&gt;web page that claims to address criticisms of Oktar&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, you may recall that in his lavish creationist book, &lt;i&gt;Atlas of Creation&lt;/i&gt;, he claims that organisms never change; the bulk of the book consists of plagiarized photos, pairing a picture of a modern organism with a fossil that shows relatively little change. The classic example of his sloppy methodology is that one of the pairs is of caddis flies, and the modern example is this one, an artificial lure, complete with fishhook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, they have an explanation for that now: uh, yeah, they &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt; to do that. It was a &lt;i&gt;model&lt;/i&gt;, yeah, that's the ticket. They put that picture in the book intentionally, yeah, and they knew they'd catch Richard Dawkins. And then Adnan would get a date with Heather Locklear! Yeah, that's the ticket!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claim regarding the caddisfly: Dawkins highlighted the photograph of caddisfly in Adnan Oktar's opus, Atlas of Creation as a great discovery.  However this is the photograph of a model particularly put by the author in the book. Whether the photograph is of a model or not does not change the fact that this living being is still alive in our day. Desperate, speechless and bored in the face of the extraordinary evidences of Creation in the Atlas of Creation that invalidate evolution, Dawkins takes every opportunity to express this photograph of a model particularly put by the author in his book as a great discovery. By this attitude Dawkins, in fact, reveals the pathetic situation in which Darwinism finds itself. Caddisfly lives in our time with the same appearance its millions of years old fossil has. That is, it has not undergone any change. That is why Dawkins feels offended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, evolution is pathetic, because they noticed that Adnan Oktar &lt;i&gt;proudly&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;intentionally&lt;/i&gt; included a photo of a fake fly in his book! That doesn't quite explain why the &lt;a href="http://sciencereligionnews.blogspot.com/2009/02/evolution-of-harun-yahyas-atlas-of.html"&gt;creationists have been purging the photos in their more recent work&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're very defensive about the &lt;i&gt;Atlas of Creation&lt;/i&gt;, too. They insist that Oktar's work is respected everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Humanist seems to be in trouble probably due to the extraordinary, real and scientific evidence submitted by Mr. Adnan Oktar to Darwinism. Indeed, due to this trouble the magazine made a very interesting comment and claimed that Mr. Oktar's claims are met with lampoon in the West. Yet the editorial board in question very well knows that Mr. Oktar provides precise and concrete evidence against Darwinism which is a theory that thoroughly lacks any evidence. Indeed for this very reason he is the one Creationist author whose views are most respected all around the world. Readers worldwide enjoy his books which are also downloaded in ample amounts on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to be the one to break the news to him, but the &lt;i&gt;Atlas of Creation&lt;/i&gt; is widely regarded as a joke. I know quite a few scientists, and we&amp;#39;ve talked about it; receiving a copy of his book is an opportunity for mirth, and we kind of hope that he&amp;#39;ll send us one…&lt;i&gt;to laugh over&lt;/i&gt;. I felt left out for a while when I didn&amp;#39;t get one, and a colleague gave me one out of sympathy—I&amp;#39;ve since felt some vindication, though, as they&amp;#39;ve sent me &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; more copies now, with different colors of covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are a hoot. I should scan in some of the ridiculous arguments they make, sometime; the photoshopped skeletons to illustrate what evolutionists ought to find but haven't makes me laugh every time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/makin_em_sweat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tMRiPCNbDik" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258552586328"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1249">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15bb16c7d056bb95</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Evidence in Medicine: Correlation and Causation</title><published>2009-11-18T13:48:52Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T13:48:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1249" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following was cross-posted at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2741"&gt;ScienceBasedMedicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two general approaches to subverting science-based medicine (SBM): anti-science and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/anatomy-of-pseudoscience/"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. Anti-scientific approaches are any that seek to undermine science as the determinant of the standard of care, often overtly advocating for spiritual or subjectively-based standards. Some attack the validity of science itself, usually with post-modernist philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscientific proponents, on the other hand, praise science, they just do it wrong. In reality there is a continuum along a spectrum from complete pseudoscience to pristine science, and no clear demarcation in the middle. Individual studies vary along this spectrum as well – there are different kinds of evidence, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and there are no perfect studies. Further, when evaluating any question in medicine, the literature (the totality of all those individual studies) rarely points uniformly to a single answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These multiple overlapping continua of scientific quality create the potential to make just about any claim seem scientific simply by how the evidence is interpreted. Also, even a modest bias can lead to emphasizing certain pieces of evidence over others, leading to conclusions which seem scientific but are unreliable. Also, proponents can easily begin with a desired conclusion, and then back fill the evidence to suit their needs (rather than allowing the evidence to lead them to a conclusion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine movement systematically endorses any piece of evidence that seems to support the conclusion that there is some correlation between vaccines and neurological injury. Meanwhile, they find ways to dismiss any evidence which fails to show such a connection. They, of course, accuse the scientific community of doing the same thing, and each side cites biases and conflicts in the other to explain the discrepancy. It is no wonder the public is confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, do we use the evidence to arrive at reliable scientific conclusions? That is what I will be discussing in this series of posts, beginning with a discussion of correlation and causation, but here is a quick overview: SBM is achieved through a consideration of scientific plausibility and a systematic review of the clinical evidence. In other words – all scientific evidence is considered in a fair and thorough manner, including basic science and clinical evidence, and placed in the context of what we know about how the world works. Further, we do not rely upon any individual’s systematic review of the evidence, but on the consensus of analysis among experts and institutions – so that any biases are likely to average out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the final continuum – the consensus of expert opinion based upon systematic reviews can either result in a solid and confident unanimous opinion, a reliable opinion with serious minority objections, a genuine controversy with no objective resolution, or simply the conclusion that we currently lack sufficient evidence and do not know the answer. It can also lead, of course, to a solid consensus of expert opinion combined with a fake controversy manufactured by a group driven by ideology or greed and not science. The tobacco industry’s campaign of doubt against the conclusion that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer is one example. The anti-vaccine movement’s fear-mongering about vaccines and autism is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation and Causation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of scientific evidence is based upon a correlation of variables – they tend to occur together. Scientists are careful to point out that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. The assumption that A causes B simply because A correlates with B is a logical fallacy – it is not a legitimate form of argument. However, sometimes people commit the opposite fallacy – dismissing correlation entirely, as if it does not imply causation. This would dismiss a large swath of important scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the tobacco industry abused this fallacy to argue that simply because smoking correlates with lung cancer that does not mean that smoking causes lung cancer. The simple correlation is not enough to arrive at a conclusion of causation, but multiple correlations all triangulating on the conclusion that smoking causes lung cancer, combined with biological plausibility, does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation must always be put into perspective. There are two basic kinds of clinical scientific studies that may provide evidence of correlation – observational and experimental. Experimental studies are ones in which some intervention is given to a study population. In experimental studies it is possible to control for many variables, and even reasonably isolate the variable of interest, and so correlation in a well-designed experimental study is very powerful, and we generally can assume cause and effect. If active treatment vs placebo correlates with a better outcome, then we interpret that as the treatment causing the improved outcome. (”Well-designed” is the key here – a subject of a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In observational studies populations are observed in the real world, but no intervention is being given. Observational studies can be very powerful, because they can look as extremely large numbers of subjects (more than is practical in an experimental study) but the weakness is that all variables cannot be controlled for. Researchers can account for known variables (race, age, and sex are common), but it is always the unknown variables that can confound such studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In observational studies lack of correlation is easier to interpret than a positive correlation – if there is no correlation between A and B then we can pretty much rule out a causal relationship. The only caveat is that a correlation can be obscured by a factor that was not accounted for. When a correlation is found in observational studies – that is when the assumption of cause and effect must be avoided, and more thorough analysis is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If A correlates with B, then A may cause B, B may cause A, A and B may be caused by a common variable C, or the correlation may be a statistical fluke and not “real”. Further studies are then required to confirm the correlation and any specific causal hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the smoking example again – the hypothesis that smoking causes cancer as the causal relationship to explain the correlation raises several predictions, all later confirmed. The duration of smoking increases risk of cancer (a dose response relationship), stopping smoking reduces the risk of cancer, greater intensity of smoking increases risk, and smoking unfiltered vs filtered cigarettes is associated with higher risk. These various correlations only make sense if smoking causes lung cancer. Further, tobacco smoke contains substances demonstrated to be carcinogens – so there is biological plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest abuse of the correlation equals causation fallacy is the assumption of cause and effect from a single anecdotal case. Here we are not talking about an observational study where statistics are brought to bear on hundreds or thousands of subjects, but the uncontrolled observation of a single individual. Such cases are very compelling to the human psyche – we are more moved by stories than statistics. But they make for very weak scientific evidence. This is not to say they are worthless – even a single case can raise the question of a possible correlation. But they cannot be used to establish even that a correlation is real. (Anecdotes generate questions, not answers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again to use the anti-vaccine movement as an example, it is easy to generate fear based upon individual cases of bad outcomes after receiving the vaccine. We are hard-wired to find such events compelling. But such correlations should and do occur on a regular basis, even without any causal factor. Further, it is natural, after a new disease or disorder appears, to think back over any recent events that may explain it. Our minds will latch onto anything that sticks out, and over time our memories will even morph to make the apparent correlation more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;a href="http://noworldsystem.com/2009/11/15/pregnant-women-miscarriage-after-h1n1-vaccine/"&gt;anti-vaccine and conspiracy site &lt;/a&gt;that is essentially collecting anecdotes of correlation between the flu vaccine and miscarriages among women. This goes beyond the assumption of cause and effect from correlation, to the assumption of correlation from anecdote. Common things occur together commonly. Given the number of spontaneous miscarriages, and the number of pregnant women receiving the flu vaccine, we would expect there to be thousands of women who miscarry within 24 hours of receiving the flu vaccine, just by chance alone. So first we have to ask – is this a real correlation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19850275?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=1"&gt;systematic reviews of existing evidence&lt;/a&gt;, is no. There is no apparent risk of adverse outcome in pregnancy from the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media tends to develop a narrative they think will sell, and then that becomes the story they are telling. In the midst of this severe flu season, the narrative the media is telling is of dramatic adverse events following the flu vaccine. These events are always there, because people are always getting sick, and when you vaccinate millions of people, some of them will get sick afterwards by chance alone. Individual stories are therefore misleading – we need statistics on large number of people to arrive at any conclusions. But statistics don’t make headlines – individual stories do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC and the WHO are tracking the statistics as the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccines are rolled out. In the end, these statistics will tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, correlation is an extremely valuable type of scientific evidence in medicine. But first correlations must be confirmed as real, and then every possible causational relationship must be systematically explored. In the end correlation can be used as powerful evidence for a cause and effect relationship between a treatment and benefit, or a risk factor and a disease. But it is also one of the most abused types of evidence, because it is easy and even tempting to come to premature conclusions based upon the preliminary appearance of a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258551157133"><id gr:original-id="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/11/tracking-niche-project-of-grinnellian.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/041dc3b144046a68</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Tracking the Niche, A Project of Grinnellian Proportions</title><published>2009-11-18T07:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T07:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/2doLTCNxVZo/tracking-niche-project-of-grinnellian.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://ecographica.blogspot.com/2009/11/tracking-niche-project-of-grinnellian.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Grinnell’s philosophy of scientific inquiry focused intently on the task of accumulating as much raw data as possible. For example, during the biological survey he carried out in Yosemite National Park between the years 1914 and 1920, Grinnell and his field crews collected 817 photographs, nearly 3000 animal specimens and more than 2000 pages of notes! Being organized and detail oriented is one thing, but Grinnell’s drive for thoroughness approached the obsessive.

Recognising this, we can train nursery staff to be as responsive to the children in their care as possible. But a new study by Claire Vallotton raises an interesting and under-examined issue - what if there's something about some infants that leads their carers to engage with them more, thus giving them an advantage over their peers.Vallotton filmed interactions between 18 student caregivers and 10 infants (aged between 4 and 19 months) at the Infant and Toddler programme at the UC Davis child development lab. Carers working here were taught "baby signing" - this is a gesture-based system for pre-verbal infants and adults to communicate with each other. For example, pointing the hands inwards, towards the mid-line, with fingers touching, is the sign for "more". The student carers interacted with their designated child one-on-one, and importantly for this research, they occasionally switched which child was under their care, thus allowing Vallotton to see if some children consistently provoked more engagement from different carers.There were some general effects: boys and older children provoked more attentiveness from their carers. But Vallotton's more novel finding was that infants who responded more to their carers' signs, either with signs of their own or with conventional gestures such as pointing or waving, tended to provoke more engagement and responsiveness from their carers.This carer responsiveness was measured with a scale containing items such as "follows child's gaze" and "is at the child's physical level". Crucially, it was not an infant's total amount, or variety, of signing or gesturing that was related to more carer attentiveness. It was specifically an infant's amount of gestural response to the carer's own attempts at communication. In other words, the carers engaged a lot more with babies and toddlers who responded to them. This may sound obvious but it suggests the carers were biased, probably subconsciously. They were effectively making more effort with the infants who interacted with them more.Obviously a major factor limiting the generalisability of this research is the use of baby-signing in this care group. However, Vallotton thinks her findings probably do apply more generally. "Caregivers [were] more responsive to infants who use more gestures, regardless of whether those gestures were conventional pointing or infant signs," she said. And the take-home message, she concluded, is that "infants' communicative behaviours affect caregiver responsiveness ... Increasing infants' use of gestures and signs may be a means to enhance responsiveness in caregiver-child interaction, a possibility that should be tested experimentally."_________________________________Vallotton, C.

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (PDF) over time.Two and a half years ago, The Neurocritic wrote about the very early results of deep brain stimulation (DBS)  in the nucleus accumbens for severe, refractory depression. You can read about the details of the procedure and its scientific motivation here:More About the Nucleus AccumbensNAcc Localization for DBSBriefly, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is considered one of the brain&amp;#39;s PLEASURE CENTRES:When the cortex has received and processed a sensory stimulus indicating a reward, it sends a signal announcing this reward to a particular part of the midbrain–the ventral tegmental area (VTA)–whose activity then increases. The VTA then releases dopamine not only into the nucleus accumbens, but also into the septum, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex.The nucleus accumbens then activates the individual’s motor functions, while the prefrontal cortex focuses his or her attention.It makes sense as a DBS target region from the standpoint of anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable life events) in major depression. Why not stimulate the &amp;quot;pleasure center&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re feeling blue? Extensive research in animals and humans has demonstrated &amp;quot;hedonic hot spots&amp;quot; in the NAcc.The current paper by Bewernick et al., 2009 reports on the results from 10 patients who received NAcc-DBS for at least 12 months. These patients were severely ill and completely non-responsive to any other treatment. On average, they had been continuously depressed for 10 years, were completely unable to work, had been hospitalized numerous times, had failed over 20 medication treatment courses, were currently on 4 different drugs, had received over 20 electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments, and 316 hours of therapy, all to no avail.The primary results are illustrated in Fig. 1 above. Half the patients (n=5) were considered &amp;quot;treatment responders&amp;quot; who experienced a 50% reduction of depressive symptom severity as assessed by the HDRS, and half did not respond. Anxiety scores also declined in the responders, and engagement in pleasant activities increased.There were some adverse events related to the surgical procedure (swollen eye in 6 patients, pain and dysphasia in 3), as well as transient adverse events related to stimulation parameter changes e.g., anxiety (n=3), hypomania, paresthesia, and agitation (all n=2). Nonetheless, the authors concluded on a positive note:DBS to the nucleus accumbens had clinically relevant antidepressant and antianhedonic effects in a patient population that was at least as treatment-resistant as those reported on in other studies of DBS in major depression (Lozano et al., 2008; Malone et al. 2009). The efficacy to adverse event ratio in this small group was favorable. Site-specific antianxiety effects also could be demonstrated.By targeting one site in a network of brain regions implicated in processing of affective stimuli, it was possible to manipulate anhedonia in particular. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and rigid selection criteria are needed to analyze effects of stimulation to different targets on specific symptoms and clinical phenotypes of depression. In the future, symptom-based DBS therapy, adapted to the individual needs of the patients, could be a plausible treatment option for severe TRD.ReferencesBewernick, B., Hurlemann, R., Matusch, A., Kayser, S., Grubert, C., Hadrysiewicz, B., Axmacher, N., Lemke, M., Cooper-Mahkorn, D., &amp;amp; Cohen, M.

&lt;p&gt;The Gap is mentioned among the “Naughty” places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Gap – Web site: No mention of “Christmas.” Search revealed six non-Gap manufacturers? items that included “Christmas.” &lt;strong&gt;“Go Ho Ho” TV Commercial: Lighthearted but mentions several unrelated holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; National boycott because the company repeatedly seeks to profit from “CHRISTmas” yet continues to offend Christians.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis is mine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That commercial is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the anti-Christian bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/oVMPWlWDvsI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Two, Four, Six, Eight, now’s the time to liberate&lt;br&gt;
Go Christmas, Go Hanukkah, Go Kwanza, Go Solstice.&lt;br&gt;
Go classic tree, go plastic tree, go plant a tree, go add a tree,&lt;br&gt;
You 86 the rules, you do what feels just right.&lt;br&gt;
Happy do whatever you wanukkah, and to all a cheery night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Christmas, Go Hanukkah, go whatever holiday you wanukkah.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Family Association is thrilled that Christmas is now mentioned in the ads and they’re now asking their followers to stop boycotting the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="http://action.afa.net/takeaction/gap/"&gt;they’re even more pissed off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
AFA believes this ad to be completely dismissive and disrespectful to those who celebrate the meaning and spirit of Christmas. AFA asked Gap for a meeting to discuss the ad, but Gap has not responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is Gap’s answer to recognizing Christmas, we are deeply disappointed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What.  The.  Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They won’t settle for anything less than a commercial that says, “Fuck the Jews,” will they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Neil&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-neil17-2009nov17,0,2040716.story"&gt;the same reaction as so many of us&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It would be easy to get sidetracked into debating the merits of the War on Christmas. Why, for example, is the phrase “Happy holidays” so insufferable to Christian fundamentalists, but not the vulgar, surfeiting exploitation of Christ’s name to sell smokeless ashtrays, dessert toppings, Droid phones and trampolines? I’m not a theologian but I think the Gospels are pretty clear that Jesus was no fan of merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the real question: Why attack Gap for not using the word “Christmas” in its advertising when in fact it does, and in a big way too?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will Christian pastors tell their congregations not to support groups like AFA?  Saving them the wasted money seems like a perfect holiday gift this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Jessica&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;muggle&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/18/the-gap-hates-christmas-say-christians-with-tunnel-vision/#comment-397139"&gt;left a comment&lt;/a&gt; that deserves some attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… [The Gap&amp;#39;s] customer service number (I didn’t find an e-mail) is 1-800-427-7895. Select more options then feedback to get a live person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to pick on-line or in-store so I just picked on-line and talked to a very polite woman who I think was delightfully surprised to hear my praise for an all inclusive commercial. You could hear the fatigue in her voice when I said I was calling about the commercial and you could hear it disappear when I went on to praise them for having such a great commercial and that I appreciated their being all-inclusive of everyone. I even told her I don’t normally shop at Gap but I got my daughter and grandson matching t-shirts and will now go to Gap to get them jeans. I even told her to pass my comments along and be sure to tell them to stick by their guns and not give into AFA pressure. She was very pleasant and thanked me for the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call and give support for this ad and if you’re going to make a purchase because of it, let them know. Best way we can counter this war on Christmas nonsense.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It’s time to change his show’s name to &amp;quot;Antireality Time&amp;quot;. Because &lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;when he talks vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, he wanders into major woowoo territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to debunk his antivax nonsense, since actual doctors who have facts at their fingertips do it so well, like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/bill_maher_flames_out_over_vaccines.php"&gt;in this tirade from Orac&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1238"&gt;Steve Novella’s more measured (but just as devastating) response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But there is one thing I want to mention. My favorite part is when Maher says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I agree with my critics who say there are far more qualified people than me — its [sic] just that mainstream media rarely interviews doctors and scientists who present an alternative point of view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, that’s total baloney. Go watch the news and other talking head shows; they often have people talking up the &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; (that is to say, wrong) point of view when it comes to vaccines. And if these people aren’t certified physicians, what does that tell you? Maybe you’ll come to the correct conclusion that the overwhelming majority of physicians think antivaxxers are full of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And second, about talk shows not having &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; viewpoints — and this is critical — &lt;em&gt;why should they?&lt;/em&gt; When the weatherman talks about lightning in your area, should he give equal time to the Zeus theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feh. Maher digs himself deeper every time he talks about this. Some people hold him up as an icon of skepticism, but it’s simply not true. A lot of non-believers love his ideas and attitude when it comes to religion, which is fine, but it doesn’t translate to his other beliefs, especially when it comes to real medicine. What he does isn’t skepticism, it’s dogma, and just as dogmatic as the religions he mocks.&lt;/p&gt;

On one hand, they've stepped up their efforts to link to vaccination any illness anywhere that occurs within the remote temporal vicinity of a person getting a shot, and they've focused specifically on the H1N1 vaccine and (perhaps to a lesser extent) on the seasonal flu vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the media coverage of the pandemic has left less room for fawning editorials or interviews with prominent antivaxxers. Most coverage, at least as far as I can tell, seems to be focused on all the people getting the H1N1 vaccine and all the people who want it but can't get it yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of how media coverage has changed (or not), the uber-nutters are still out there, as evidenced by &lt;a href="http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=11495215"&gt;this recent story&lt;/a&gt; from WTHR Indianapolis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, an anonymous pediatrician in Indianapolis received death threats from a guy in Seattle, Washington named Stan Lippman. From the police report:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Lippmann said that something bad might happen to the doctor and her nurse and the nurse's unborn baby. He further said 'the H1N1 virus is a hoax made up by the government in order to inoculate thousands of children to get them sick.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where's the evidence of this? Where are the thousands of sick children? Lippman doesn't seem to notice this conspicuous absence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is precious little information on Mr. Lippman, but he is likely a conspiracy theorist:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He keeps a vaccine update on the site focusing on the number of Israelis who die after getting shots.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This odd kind of specificity (what about gentiles who die after getting shots?) tells me that he's not looking for facts: he seems to be propogating some sort of weird conspiracy to kill Jews by vaccination. I call it weird because, as conspiracy theories go, Jews are usually on the &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; conspiring against everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not only is he conspiracy-mongering, he's also entirely full of shit:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Lippman claims that "the flu shot that is now given to children contains 1,600 times as much mercury as a can of tuna."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Words cannot express the profound divorce from reality that it takes to make such an intensely ridiculous statement. Only the multi-dose version of the H1N1 contains any thimerosal at all. The single-dose shots and the nasal spray contain no thimerosal. Of course, it's irrelevant anyway, because thimerosal is not mercury and has never been shown to be harmful, anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, when you're Stan Lippman, pure metallic mercury itself is probably mixed in with the other ingredients of the vaccine. But when you do the math, assuming 52.7 micrograms in 6 ounces of tuna fish (&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/science/mercuryinfish.html"&gt;figured from the average figured by the FDA in a 1993 report&lt;/a&gt;), you find that Lippman is arguing that the flu vaccine contains 84320 micrograms of methylmercury. That's 84.32 milligrams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That much mercury in a tiny little vaccine vial probably wouldn't go unnoticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Lippman's wrongness pales in comparison to the actions to which his wrongness has led him. The antivaxxers are quite clearly a danger to public health; resurgence of measles in the UK, a recent mumps outbreak in the Bronx, and resurgences of vaccine-preventable diseases in areas with low vaccination rates attest to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People like Stan Lippman, however, demonstrate that the antivaccination movement is also dangerous on an individual level. Dr. Paul Offit received death threats for fighting against the antivaxxers, and now it's clear he's not the only one. And they aren't stopping there:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The doctor's offices in Ohio have also been targeted. Metro Police say they are working with the FBI and Homeland Security's fusion center as part of this interstate investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;They won't stop at endangering children and those who cannot, for medical reasons, be vaccinated. Some of them even want to kill vaccine advocates directly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Antivaxxers are seriously wrong, seriously harmful, and some of them are clearly seriously unhinged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lippman apparently has a website, but a cursory googling did not turn it up. If I can find it, I will most definitely tear it apart here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SwPTvDjr-_I/AAAAAAAAA3g/gdT6BKokuoo/s1600/11495215_BG2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:180px;height:101px" title="Fuck you, Stan." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SwPTvDjr-_I/AAAAAAAAA3g/gdT6BKokuoo/s400/11495215_BG2.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is Stan Lippman.

When you poke the bulge in NGC 4710, however, you get the history of how galaxies form. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0914.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/hst_ngc4710.jpg" alt="hst_ngc4710" title="hst_ngc4710" width="610" height="314"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome. And you really need to &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0914b.html"&gt;embiggen this one&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of the incredible beauty and resolution of the picture. Try &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/large/heic0914b.jpg"&gt;the 4000 x 2000 pixel one&lt;/a&gt; on for size!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 4710 is an edge-on spiral galaxy located about 60 million light years away in the Virgo Cluster. That puts it in the next town over, cosmically speaking, so it’s a rich target for something like Hubble Space Telescope. This image, newly released (but taken in 2006 before the last servicing mission), reveals spectacular details in the sideways galaxy. Views like this really accentuate the huge sprawling dust complexes littering spiral galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t the dust astronomers are interested in here. Spirals have three main parts: a more-or-less spherical bulge in the center, the disk (which has the spiral arms), and a giant halo of stars surrounding them both. We understand a lot about spirals, but lots of big questions remain, including how and when the bulge forms. A galaxy is born out of a vast, collapsing cloud of gas. It’s possible that the bulge forms straight away, with the infalling gas of the protogalaxy making stars which build up in the galactic center. It’s also possible that the bulge forms &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;, well after the galaxy itself takes shape, as stars in the inner part of the galactic disk interact gravitationally and fall to the center, building up the bulge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there might be a way to distinguish these formation mechanisms, even billions of years after the fact. Globular clusters are small (well, a couple of dozen light years across or so) balls of hundreds of thousands of stars. They orbit bigger galaxies; the Milky Way has well over 100 orbiting it. We know that many globulars formed at the same time as their parent galaxies; the stars in the clusters can be incredibly old. This means that perhaps the formation of the galaxy and its attendant clusters are connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s thought that the same process that creates the bulge in the &amp;quot;forms at the same time as the galaxy itself&amp;quot; scenario also creates globular clusters, but the other process (stars from the disk falling inward) does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; create globulars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where NGC 4710 comes in. Being edge-on, we can see the bulge clearly, so it can be studied. But it also presents a good view of its globulars, so scientists can look at pictures like this one and simply count up the number of globular clusters near the galaxy and then figure out if the number is consistent with one of the two formation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, NGC 4710 sports very few globulars, indicating the bulge formed &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the galaxy itself. But NGC 4710 is only one of many galaxies being studied this way. Will they all show the same sluggish beginnings to their central bulges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell. But I hope that as more of these galaxies are studied more images as lovely as this one become available.&lt;/p&gt;

The American Cancer Society currently recommends women start screening at 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.feministing.com/archives/018947.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Feministing+(Feministing)&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"&gt;Feministing&lt;/a&gt; reported this as “New patronizing guidelines for mammograms have been implemented by a government task force, recommending that women over 40 shouldn’t get routine mammograms because of certain risks like women’s “anxiety,”&amp;quot; which made me sigh sadly, because it is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They link to &lt;a href="http://feministlawprofessors.com/?p=13758"&gt;Feminist Law Professors&lt;/a&gt;, who writes this about the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A government task force claims that women don’t need to have routine screening for breast cancer until age 50.  (See the AP story here.)  But the American Cancer Society recommends routine mammograms for women 40 and over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government task force’s reasoning?  Because the “anxieties” caused by mammography, false positives and biopsies do not decrease mortality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the federal government is so concerned about women’s anxieties, how about more jobs, affordable child care, lower tax rates, clean air to breathe, and an end to discrimination? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can control my own anxiety about having my breast squished by a mammography machine, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commenters at Feministing quickly jumped in to correct the original poster, but at FLP things only got sillier. Because these are usually good sources of intelligent information, I wanted to post this to reassure women who might be thinking along similar lines: these guidelines are &lt;strong&gt;not patronizing&lt;/strong&gt; and they are based upon &lt;strong&gt;real data&lt;/strong&gt; that suggest &lt;strong&gt;women will be better off&lt;/strong&gt; this way. Here are a few points to bear in mind:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A government task force claims that women don’t need to have routine screening for breast cancer until age 50.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. The task force recommends that most women don’t need it until the age of 50, but stipulates that “The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient’s values regarding specific benefits and harms.” In other words, if you have risk factors, then your doctor may recommend you begin earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the American Cancer Society recommends routine mammograms for women 40 and over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The ACS’s guidelines are twenty years old. The task force’s recommendation was just released, based on updated data and learning from the past 20 years. As a side note, the ACS does not recommend self-examination, and the World Health Organization recommends beginning screenings at age 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The government task force’s reasoning?  Because the “anxieties” caused by mammography, false positives and biopsies do not decrease mortality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interesting that those are listed in the reverse order of their relative importance. The basic fact of the matter is that current evidence shows that &lt;em&gt;we do not save more lives&lt;/em&gt; by screening all women before the age of 50. These screenings only contribute to more false positives, which in turn causes an incredible amount of anxiety. Have you ever been told you have cancer? Kind of upsetting, I’d imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the federal government is so concerned about women’s anxieties, how about more jobs, affordable child care, lower tax rates, clean air to breathe, and an end to discrimination? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Okay, sure. This panel of doctors will immediately stop trying to improve lives and safeguard women’s health and immediately get going on lowering your taxes. That’s a red herring, in which completely unrelated issues are introduced in order to distract from the issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can control my own anxiety about having my breast squished by a mammography machine, thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It should be quite clear by now that the anxiety doesn’t come from the inconvenience and pain of the mammography machine, but in being told you have cancer when you do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first commenter at FLP says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just who is this government task force? Probably a bunch of men… Why havent they given the people an updated stating that men should only be screened for testicular cancer when they turn 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD Dorsey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, CD didn’t bother to actually read the linked article or do the slightest bit of research, which is exactly why I’m writing this post. So many people read something online and immediately believe whatever it is, not even pausing long enough to click a link. To those of you who are reading this right now, please do not believe me. Click the links. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer CD, the vice chair of the task force is quoted in the AP article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The benefits are less and the harms are greater when screening starts in the 40s,” said Dr. Diana Petitti, vice chair of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to guess Diana is a woman. Of course you could always visit the web site of the &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfab.htm"&gt;US Preventative Services Task Forc&lt;/a&gt;e to see that at least 8 out of 16 members are women (I’m not including one “Sandy” who could be a man or a woman), but that took all of 30 seconds so I can see how one would shy from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, kudos to the Feministing crowd for sticking up for evidence-based medicine in the comments section. Hopefully, that kind of rational thinking will influence future posts on women’s health.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258539253860"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/clock_quotes_479.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e279b2830bc9de83</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-11-18T08:56:22Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T08:56:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/c3viR431gvY/clock_quotes_479.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/clock_quotes_479.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is easy to fly into a passion - anybody can do that - but to be angry with the right person to the right extent and at the right time and with the right object and in the right way - that is not easy, and it is not everyone who can do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister knows Ms. Singer personally and I briefly got to meet her myself at an autism conference about two weeks ago. But for all Handley’s talk about being sensitive to autism moms and all the “stop attacking the autism moms” rhetoric, Handley proves once again to be a total hypocrite. It’s unacceptable to criticize his organization because they hide behind innocent, well-intentioned parents who have the difficult task of raising autistic children…except when they disagree with him. Then it’s perfectly okay to attack them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, Handley doesn’t exactly attempt to discuss the actual science of his position. Of course not. He doesn’t understand the science. So he gets his kicks out of just attacking his critics personally like a dirty $cientologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my favorite bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Singer is simply saying things that Paul Offit, Tom Insel, Amy Wallace, Geraldine Dawson, David Gorski, Steven Novella and many other supposedly smart people have also been saying: that “the science has spoken, vaccines do not cause autism.” This makes every single one of them a blazing liar, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, isn’t it remarkable that all the actual medical experts somehow agree. What are the odds? It’s almost like they’re examining the same data and arriving at the same undeniable conclusions of that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have written extensively on this hungry lie. ( See &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/cdc-aap-paul-offit-feeding-a-hungry-lie.html"&gt;Tayloe, Offit, Minshew, Katz, Snyderman, et. al.: Feeding a Hungry Lie &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/alison-singer-feeds-the-hungry-lie-twice.html"&gt;Alison Singer Feeds the Hungry Lie Twice.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he has written extensively about this. Only he never manages to properly explain how it’s a lie without making at least a dozen lies himself. Nor does he even entertain the possibility that if the information were hypothetically incorrect as he claims, that maybe the other side is merely in error. Nope. He leaps write into libelous accusations of deliberate falsehood. Classy guy, that J.B. Handley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heck, I even created a website, &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org/"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; to refute the hungry lie with details and show the world how weak the science really is that people like Ms. Singer continually refer to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and multiple scientists have illustrated how dishonest that propaganda of yours is:  &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451#more-451"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459#more-459"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=466#more-466"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
They also explained the dishonesty of Handely’s response to those refutations &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523#more-523"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the cover of the Wired article says “vaccines don’t cause autism”, which Ms. Wallace repeats throughout her article. And, yet, when pressed to site the specifics of what research has been done, Ms. Wallace herself spells out that only a single vaccine – MMR – has ever been studied for its relationship to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she actually said that or not doesn’t change the fact that every vaccine currently on the market has passed years of clinical testing and the flu vaccine has also been specifically tested as well. Scientists don’t need to waste their lives trying to convince the unconvincible anymore than it’s their job to disprove Santa Claus. It’s the claimant’s job to back up their claim and thus far, you’ve failed to show any real evidence for a link and whenever a claim has been debunked, you’ve simply moved the goalpost. First it was MMR vaccines. Then it was thimerosal. Then it was aluminum. Then it was squalene. Then it was just everything in the vaccines, a perfectly unfalsifiable claim. How did you arrive at the conclusion that the vaccines aren’t safe, J.B.? Do you have special knowledge the rest of the world doesn’t? Does the voice of the god speak to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a exhaustive compilation of literature debunking virtually every claim Handley has ever made &lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Vaccines"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at J.B.’s lies/”mistakes”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lie #1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly one vaccine, MMR, has been studied for its relationship to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1111"&gt;“Another Study Showing Lack of Correlation Between Mercury and Autism”&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Novella&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lie #2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm…Hmm…new science? Like these perhaps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Blaxill recently reported (&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/blockbuster-primate-study-shows-significant-harm-from-one-birth-dose-of-a-mercurycontaining-vaccine.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A research team led by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and Thoughtful House reported today that exposure to a birth dose of a hepatitis B vaccine that included an ethyl mercury preservative caused significant delays in the development of several survival reflexes in male rhesus macaque monkeys. The findings were published on line today in the journal Neurotoxicology.[You can purchase the article from Science Direct (HERE).”&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, a recent study published in the journal the Annals of Epidemiology titled “Hepatitis B Vaccination of Male Neonates and Autism” (HERE) found that “Boys who received the hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life had 2.94 greater odds for ASD [autism] compared to later- or unvaccinated boys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare the studies Handley finds so unacceptable to the “studies” Handley finds so compelling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3140"&gt;Another weak study “proves” vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;“Monkey business in autism research, part II”&lt;/a&gt; by David Gorski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lie #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really just a continuation of the first lie Ms. Singer tells, but she builds on the first lie to feign the exasperation many on the other side try to do that vaccines have already been looked at so let’s move on. It is a dishonest whitewash, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I invite people to turn to the many, many vaccine studies cited above among many, many others that are easily available. And as Christopher Hitchens says, “What can be asserted without evidence can be just as easily dismissed without evidence.” Handley just says it’s dishonest whitewashing but never explains why that is. He can’t. He knows he can’t. That’s why all he does is climb trees and fling feces at his critics. If he had any real science backing him up, he’d have a Nobel Prize by now and be published in a reputable medical journal by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we parents ever trust people who will lie so freely and easily about something this important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We parents? You mean like Alison Singer? Or do you just mean the parents who naively allow you to exploit their plight to bulster your career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091116163212.htm"&gt;Researchers find the gene for empathy?&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a genetic variation that may contribute to how empathetic a human is, and how that person reacts to stress. In the first study of its kind, a variation in the hormone/neurotransmitter oxytocin’s receptor was linked to a person’s ability to infer the mental state of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this same genetic variation also related to stress reactivity. These findings could have a significant impact in adding to the body of knowledge about the importance of oxytocin, and its link to conditions such as autism and unhealthy levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bloggers are also subject to criminal law, for example in respect of contempt of court and, where applicable, unfair commercial practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Bloggers are also subject to contractual obligations to the Blogging service providers (such as www.blogger.com in my case) or to their server. (Some Bloggers escape these further obligations by controlling their own servers.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So those who say that Blogging should not be regulated are perhaps missing the point that it already is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is against this background that one should consider a possible move by the PCC to regulate Blogs. The source for this possibility is (of all things) a &lt;a href="http://ianburrell.independentminds.livejournal.com/8357.html"&gt;Blogpost by Ian Burrell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is clear that such thinking is at a very preliminary stage; in fact, even saying that is perhaps putting it too highly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, it is important for Bloggers and their readers to think about this possibility now and, in my view, signal their informed opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regulation means restriction. To be regulated means that there are things one cannot do which one otherwise would do. Accordingly, if one can do such things anyway, one is not really being regulated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regulation also means being subject to another person's enforcement of that regulation, the &lt;em&gt;regulator&lt;/em&gt;. This enforcement can be at the regulator's own motion, or at the application of a third party, the &lt;em&gt;complainant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even schemes of so-called &lt;em&gt;self-regulation&lt;/em&gt; seek to separate out the roles of the &lt;em&gt;regulated&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;regulator&lt;/em&gt;: the PCC is supposedly independent of the newspaper industry; even the Reader's Editor at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; is distinct from the editorial team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in the case of Blogging, to accept PCC regulation would mean to accept further restrictions than are there already under the general law and (for many) the contractual relations with Blog service providers and servers. It would also introduce a new dynamic, with possible complainants and a regulator to whom a Blogger will be accountable for their Blogging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this in turn will open up a new avenue for strategic complainants. A strategic complaint is one where there is an ulterior objective of generally silencing a person on a particular issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may well be that the PCC is ineffective and unimpressive, but it still will mean that a second party (the regulator) and a third party (the complainant), over which of course the Blogger has no control, can place the Blogger seemingly in breach of a regulatory obligation. Moreover, the strategic complainant can cause the Blogger to have to spend time and effort in dealing with a complaint or series of complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In the context of Bad Science Blogging, one should recall that PCC complaints were the weapons of choice of chiropractors before they discovered the libel shotgun.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notwithstanding these general objections to additional regulation, and to the opening up of the possibility of strategic complaints, there are obvious concerns as to the basic competence of the PCC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here &lt;a href="http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2009/11/17/blogging-and-pcc-regulation-a-collective-response/"&gt; Unity at Liberal Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; has done a fine job in setting out the repeated failures by the PCC to even regulate the newspaper industry properly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no reason whatsoever to believe that PCC regulation would improve the general standard of Blogging, no greater public benefit to offset the additional regulatory burdens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this brings me to a further reason to object to the possibility of PCC regulation: I do not wish to provide the PCC with any credibility or legitimacy. Yesterday Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/17/guardian-editor-resigns-pcc"&gt; resigned from the PCC Code committee&lt;/a&gt; following the PCC's whitewash report into the phonetapping scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PCC is, in my view, a figleaf over the nastiness and bad practices of the tabloid press. No credible Blogger should really want to buy into that regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some Bloggers - clearly Quangocrats in the making - who see PCC regulation as an opportunity for Bloggers to sit on committees seeking to hold the mainstream media to account and guarding against the tabloid excesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see this earnest and well-meaning stance as hopelessly naive; if anything, the participation of such worthy Bloggers in the ineffective PCC would probably be seen as further legitimising the current bad practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The possible regulation of Blogs by the PCC will probably come to nothing. I hope so. However, thinking about why such regulation would be misconceived (or indeed whether it is misconceived) is not time wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, the high standard of Blogging - such as in the comprehensive destruction of the "plethora" described by Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jul/29/simon-singh-science-chiropractic-litigation"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; - is because of the freedom of people to be Bloggers, subject only to the general law and any obligations to service providers and servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once there are additional restrictions - voluntary or not - and new ways for other people to influence what is Blogged, then Blogging will become less free and more formalised. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is exactly what the mainstream media (MSM) want. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have seen MSM hatchet jobs on Bloggers as diverse as Guido, Belle de Jour, and Night Jack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the greatest risk to Blogging is to extinguish the sheer freedom to Blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be subject to a code (over which one has no control) and to deal with a regulator and complainants (over which one also has no control) will tend to undermine this freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And once such regulation is in place, there will of course be regulation creep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I support the freedom to Blog under the general law.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you agree, please go over to Liberal Conspiracy and &lt;a href="http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2009/11/17/blogging-and-pcc-regulation-a-collective-response/"&gt; read their draft letter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I began watching this years back when it featured on ABC TV, when I didn’t even know that there was such a thing as ’skepticism’. What I immediately liked about this show was how much it reminded me of Penn and Teller’s iconoclastic attitude towards magic and illusion. In fact, after hearing that P&amp;amp;T are planning on doing a murder-solving show, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were inspired by Jonathan Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes, bringing you back to the real world for a second. We’ve got a major crisis on our hands with the snake trick. To no-one’s surprise, Health and Safety aren’t too keen on the idea of us using a live python in the act as, in their view, “&lt;/em&gt;these creatures can be rather dangerous&lt;em&gt;“. Well, yes! That’s sort of the &lt;strong&gt;point&lt;/strong&gt;. What would they suggest? You perform a death-defying escape from the coils of a very large earthworm??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a short clip from Episode one, Season one (you can find pretty much every episode online, but the box sets are still out there and I highly recommend any of the series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyPITZ7C9E"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyPITZ7C9E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this show? Essentially, the hard-done-by Jonathan works as a magician’s assistant for an arrogant American magician (Adam Klaus, played originally by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372117/"&gt;Anthony Head&lt;/a&gt; and from second-episode onwards by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0589645/"&gt;Stuart Milligan&lt;/a&gt;) in London’s theatre district. But Jonathan is more than an assistant – he’s usually the creative force behind the tricks and you’re often given the secrets behind many classic stage performances… funny how no one seems to complain about how these are blatantly revealed! After being contacted by the feisty true-crime writer Maddie Magellan, played by &lt;a title="Caroline Quentin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Quentin"&gt;Caroline Quentin&lt;/a&gt; (the two proceed to have the most absurdly difficult relationship which leads you to sympathise with Jonathan even more), she manages to entice Jonathan into helping solve crimes. Many of these, as you might guess, are approached as logic puzzles or very much like solving how a magic trick is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesca:&lt;/strong&gt; So you er… create all these fantastic illusions for Adam Klaus. So you must know all the secrets.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut. Ever since I told one of his girlfriends he had a hairpiece. She thought I said ‘herpes’. Tried to circumcise him with a tin opener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the show features a skeptical-approach with ‘how we can all be fooled’. It’s primarily a crime drama – an additional bonus is that you’ll spot comedians like &lt;a title="Jack Dee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dee"&gt;Jack Dee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Nigel Planer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Planer"&gt;Nigel Planer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Griff Rhys Jones" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griff_Rhys_Jones"&gt;Griff Rhys Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Hattie Hayridge" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_Hayridge"&gt;Hattie Hayridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Rik Mayall" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rik_Mayall"&gt;Rik Mayall&lt;/a&gt; playing serious characters too. Throughout the episodes, you’ll see variations of magic classics like ‘a locked room mystery’, escapology, ‘the Assistant’s Revenge’, mentalism, substitution and so forth – these are either shown as actual tricks on stage or used as part of the crimes committed (if this sounds familiar to those who watch &lt;em&gt;The Mentalist&lt;/em&gt;, it also features a similar integration of the main character’s former career being used in criminal investigations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I wasn’t as keen on the series after Seasons 1-3, which co-starred &lt;a title="Julia Sawalha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Sawalha"&gt;Julia Sawalha&lt;/a&gt; (as Carla Borrego), it’s the consistant charm of Jonathan and the ingenuity of the stories that make every series well worth catching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year a special was aired – The Grinning Man – and it is just as good as the earlier series. &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancreek.net"&gt;The fan site for Jonathan Creek&lt;/a&gt; reports that there is ‘&lt;em&gt;New Creek for Easter 2010&lt;/em&gt;‘ – an episode called &lt;strong&gt;The Judas Tree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 90 minute special, entitled &lt;strong&gt;The Judas Tree&lt;/strong&gt; will again star Sheridan Smith as Joey Ross along side regular Alan Davies. David Renwick will also direct again, having caught the bug with the previous special, &lt;strong&gt;The Grinning Man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The two are distinguished by the elemental composition of their spectra: Type II stars still have a hydrogen envelope and thus, hydrogen lines are prominent. Type I supernova, being the burned out cores of stars, don&amp;#39;t have that envelope, so heavier elements, like silicon are present.However, the Supernova 2002bj defies classification. Initially, it was classified as a Type II, but observation of its spectra has shown it to be more similar to a Type I (ie, it had the Silicon lines present), but it also had helium lines present which is uncharacteristic of that class. SN 2002bj also faded far more rapidly than should be expected for stars of the Type I classification.So what are they?The authors suggest this may be a new class of supernovae, called .1a supernovae, which was predicted theoretically, but had not yet been observed (or if it had, it wasn&amp;#39;t realized).The idea is that the system, instead of being composed of a white dwarf accreting mass from a red giant companion, the companion star was instead a fellow white dwarf. Models of this show that two white dwarfs in a sufficiently close binary orbit can transfer mass. Such systems are known as AM CVn stars.If this sort of system were to have one star pass its Chandrasekhar limit, several predictions about the resulting supernova could be made:- The supernova should be (relatively) faint and evolve quickly.- The short timescale would allow for easier detection of short lived isotopes like 52Fe or 48Cr in addition to the normal isotopes we see in the afterglows of supernovae (I mentioned this decay process briefly in this post.- These events should make up a few percent of all Type I supernovae observed.Of these three criteria, 2002bj fits the first to a tee. The authors don&amp;#39;t say whether or not these additional isotopes were observed. However they did hint that the higher than expected luminosity than that of this theoretical kind may be due to such short lived elements, but at the very least, this paper reinforces the idea that these should be something we keep an eye out for in the future. In regards to the last criteria, in the local region (to a distance of 60 Mpc) only 31 are Type I known, so this is still on track to meet the &amp;quot;few percent&amp;quot; criteria, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t place bets with such a small sampling.It will be interesting to see how this new class pans out in the future and just what new things we find to put in it.Poznanski, D., Chornock, R., Nugent, P., Bloom, J., Filippenko, A., Ganeshalingam, M., Leonard, D., Li, W., &amp;amp; Thomas, R.

(See also this Sept. 1 article from &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/09/01/evolution" rel="external "&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/a&gt;.)  The latest event is that the board of trustess of La Sierra University in Riverside, California, &lt;a href="http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_lasierra18.2f5fedb.html" rel="external "&gt;voted to endorse young-earth creationism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Sierra’s board of trustees last week unanimously voted to endorse Adventist beliefs that the world was created in six 24-hour days and said the teaching of evolution must be “within the context of the Adventist belief regarding creation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board also proposed that all 15 North American Adventist universities develop a curriculum that includes a “scientifically rigorous affirmation” of Adventist creation beliefs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it is confusing that this is news.  Those of us who are familiar with the history of creationism and have read Ronald Numbers’ classic &lt;em&gt;The Creationists&lt;/em&gt;, and learned that the Seventh-Day Adventists were virtually the only fundamentalists who produced major advocates supporting belief in a young earth and global flood in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century – based on the literalist visions of Adventist founder and prophetess Ellen White.  It was only in the 1960s that the young-earth/global view became dominant within American fundamentalism/conservative evangelicalism in general, primarily through the efforts of Henry Morris and John Whitcomb in &lt;em&gt;The Genesis Flood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the above, it would be natural to assume that if anyone dependably takes a stauch YEC position, it would be the Seventh Day Adventists.  The Adventists and their &lt;a href="http://www.grisda.org/" rel="external "&gt;Geoscience Research Center&lt;/a&gt; supplied most of the creationist expert witnesses in the 1981 &lt;em&gt;McLean vs. Arkansas&lt;/em&gt; trial, and the official position of the church seems to be unambiguous.  &lt;a href="http://www.educatetruth.com/articles/blogs/david-asscherick-talks-about-his-letter-to-the-gc/" rel="external "&gt;As one Adventist writes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not whether or not Darwinian evolution is true (I don’t believe it is, but that is another issue altogether). The point is an ecclesiastical one, not a scientific one: Like it or not (and I take it that Ron doesn’t like it), the official, endorsed, published, voted, endorsed, sanctioned, (add your own synonyms here _____________) position of the world-wide Seventh-day Adventist Church is that the Genesis creation account is to be literally understood as communicating an actual, literal, solar Six Day Creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-and-shut case, yes?  Well, apparently some of the professors at La Sierra haven’t been reading the history or doctrinal statements, and have been treating evolution in a less-than-completely-hostile fashion.  An example &lt;a href="http://www.educatetruth.com/la-sierra-evidence/class-syllabus-from-la-sierra-biology-department-chair/" rel="external "&gt;posted online is the syllabus of Bio112&lt;/a&gt;, which is 1/3 devoted to evolution and contains a fairly strong statement that students need to learn about the evidence for evolution, whether or not they decide to believe it.  This article gives the “dirt” on &lt;a href="http://www.educatetruth.com/articles/la-sierra-promotes-evolution/" rel="external "&gt;four La Sierra biology profs&lt;/a&gt; that apparently defiantly teach evolution. This has got some La Sierra graduate and Adventist named Shane Hilde so annoyed that he has launched a petition drive and website (it’s a big and detailed website, &lt;a href="http://www.educatetruth.com" rel="external "&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.educatetruth.com/" rel="external "&gt;http://www.educatetruth.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) with the goal of cracking down on evolution at SDA universities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilde’s campaign seems to be working.  The board of trustees decision at La Sierra is any indication, it seems to be working.  Another indication comes from an October article by Hilde:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder why LSU refuses to be transparent. As the veil is being pulled back, some parents are realizing LSU is not the place for their children. One such parent, Karen McPherson, said: “My daughter went to La Sierra. When I discovered they were teaching naturalistic evolution – I transferred her to Pacific Union College. The transfer was for this reason alone!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage is…interesting.  Apparently McPherson thinks that PUC (an Adventist school in the hills of the wine country just 1 hour north of San Francisco) is a resolutely YEC school.  I thought so also, until I visited it in 2006.  Here’s the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Wes Elsberry and I were invited to come to PUC and debate evolution for part of a student-organized speaker series.  We were initially hesitant, since we are generally skeptical of debating creationists.  However, after some discussion with the organizers, we grudgingly signed up, since it seemed like there was some chance for a reasonable discussion rather than just a Gish-gallop debate.  Wes and I drove up to PUC – but, aware of the YECiness of Adventists, we went in as armed to the teeth as academics can be, with huge powerpoint files solely devoted to putting evidence for the age of the earth and common ancestry as bluntly and non-deniably as possible.  When I spoke, I popped the slides up one-by-one and used the basic refrain, “Here are the hard facts.  If this evidence has been hidden from you before now by your teachers and professors, you should ask yourself why.”  It was pretty much a go-in-with-blazing-guns strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the discussion ensued, the students, and some of the professors, had some news for me.  “You’ve got us all wrong,” they said.  “We’re not all old-fashioned young-earth creationists and anti-evolutionists here, that’s an old stereotype about Adventists.” (Note: this is not a direct quote, rather it is just the gist of what I remember hearing.)  Subsequent discussion indicated that many of the students &amp;amp; profs were reasonably well-informed about evolution and not really skeptical of it.  After some interesting chats, Wes and I drove home, shaking our heads and commenting that if Seventh Day Adventists were becoming OK with evolution, we should keep our eyes open for flying pigs and freezing hells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, the point is: watch out Hilde &amp;amp; McPherson!  It looks like Pacific Union College isn’t safe, either!  Light the torches and sharpen the pitchforks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The other point is: even if the claims in the movie &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt; were true, which they aren’t, they still don’t add up to anything like the campaigns that have been waged against supporters of mainstream science at fundamentalist colleges.  Such things have been going on since the 1800s at evagelical schools; it has just taken until the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century for the Adventist schools to catch up.)&lt;/p&gt;

I really thought that now that &lt;em&gt;Real Time with Bill Maher&lt;/em&gt; has wrapped up its season, I wouldn’t have to talk about Bill Maher’s insane pseudo-scientific ramblings for awhile. I mean I felt like I’d said pretty much everything I had to say already in the span of three articles (&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2009m10d2-Atheist-Alliance-International--the-Bill-Maher-Controversy"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2009m10d4-Final-thoughts-on-the-Bill-Maher-controversy"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2009m10d19-Bill-Maher-digs-himself-even-deeper--the-Im-just-a-humble-investigator-asking-questions-gambit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Obviously I thought I was through after the second of those articles as I prematurely titled it “Final thoughts on the Bill Maher controversy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But alas, after much criticism from the scientific and skeptical communities, as well as &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/10/20/open-letter-to-bill-maher-on-vaccinations/"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; politely explaining the science of vaccines written by Michael Shermer, Bill &lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html"&gt;continues his campaign of ignorance&lt;/a&gt; as many of us feared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I fortunately don’t have to spend much time on this one because just about everyone in the medical, general scientific, and skeptical blogging communities have responded to Maher’s latest bullshit, including of course&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/bill_maher_flames_out_over_vaccines.php"&gt; Orac over at Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1238"&gt;a point-by-point take-down by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1238"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Also commenting on the story and linking to Orac &amp;amp; Novella’s blogs are &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/17/with-a-rebel-yell-they-cried-maher-maher-maher/"&gt;President of the James Randi Educational Foundation Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/bill_maher_makes_a_not-pology.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;; and my fellow Gotham Skeptic,&lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/blog/?p=1481"&gt; Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/new-rule-bill-maher-questions-vaccinations.html"&gt;the anti-vaccine loons at Age of Autism love Bill Maher now&lt;/a&gt;. He’s their new hero. Congrats Bill. Hope you like your new friends, because you’ve burned all your bridges with the rational community as you’ve revealed yourself to be no more rational than Ben Stein, Jenny McCarthy, and Tom Cruise. Hope it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join me in &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/contact/"&gt;contacting Sam Harris’ Reason Project&lt;/a&gt; and insisting they remove Maher from their advisory board. As long as he represents them, The Reason Project will get no support from me.&lt;/p&gt;

The two are distinguished by the elemental composition of their spectra: Type II stars still have a hydrogen envelope and thus, hydrogen lines are prominent. Type I supernova, being the burned out cores of stars, don't have that envelope, so heavier elements, like silicon are present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the Supernova 2002bj defies classification. Initially, it was classified as a Type II, but observation of its spectra has shown it to be more similar to a Type I (ie, it had the Silicon lines present), but it also had helium lines present which is uncharacteristic of that class. SN 2002bj also faded far more rapidly than should be expected for stars of the Type I classification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what are they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors suggest this may be a new class of supernovae, called .1a supernovae, which was predicted theoretically, but had not yet been observed (or if it had, it wasn't realized).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea is that the system, instead of being composed of a white dwarf accreting mass from a red giant companion, the companion star was instead a fellow white dwarf. Models of this show that two white dwarfs in a sufficiently close binary orbit can transfer mass. Such systems are known as &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans/Research/AMCVn.html"&gt;AM CVn stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this sort of system were to have one star pass its Chandrasekhar limit, several predictions about the resulting supernova could be made:&lt;br&gt;- The supernova should be (relatively) faint and evolve quickly.&lt;br&gt;- The short timescale would allow for easier detection of short lived isotopes like &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Fe or &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Cr in addition to the normal isotopes we see in the afterglows of supernovae (I mentioned this decay process briefly in &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/02/making-nickel.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;- These events should make up a few percent of all Type I supernovae observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of these three criteria, 2002bj fits the first to a tee. The authors don't say whether or not these additional isotopes were observed. However they did hint that the higher than expected luminosity than that of this theoretical kind may be due to such short lived elements, but at the very least, this paper reinforces the idea that these should be something we keep an eye out for in the future. In regards to the last criteria, in the local region (to a distance of 60 Mpc) only 31 are Type I known, so this is still on track to meet the "few percent" criteria, but we shouldn't place bets with such a small sampling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will be interesting to see how this new class pans out in the future and just what new things we find to put in it.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Science&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1126%2Fscience.1181709&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=An+Unusually+Fast-Evolving+Supernova&amp;amp;rft.issn=0036-8075&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencemag.org%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1126%2Fscience.1181709&amp;amp;rft.au=Poznanski%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Chornock%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Nugent%2C+P.&amp;amp;rft.au=Bloom%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Filippenko%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Ganeshalingam%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Leonard%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Li%2C+W.&amp;amp;rft.au=Thomas%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Astronomy%2CAstrophysics%2C+Stellar+Astronomy"&gt;Poznanski, D., Chornock, R., Nugent, P., Bloom, J., Filippenko, A., Ganeshalingam, M., Leonard, D., Li, W., &amp;amp; Thomas, R.

I mention the efforts to distill the essence of the Democrats' health care bills from the frequency of selected words, which I took up in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1643"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago (it drew a number of useful comments thatI borrowed liberally from in the "Fresh Air" piece).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These enumerations have become more fevered on all sides as the bills make their interminable way  through Congress: Only seven instances of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogher.com/health-care-debate-doing-it-yourself"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;! More than 3300 occurrences of &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt;, each a mandate that &lt;a href="http://www.blogher.com/health-care-debate-doing-it-yourself"&gt;chips away at our freedom&lt;/a&gt;! On that last point, I note that, page-for-page, &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt; is more frequent in the Constitution than in the House healthcare bill, and conclude: "Critics of the bill are still free to insist that it opens a new fast lane on the road to serfdom. But that isn't something you can prove just by counting helping verbs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the ubiquitous tallies of first-person pronouns aimed at demonstrating the egotism or arrogance of public figures. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The targets have included &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/opinion/08rich.html"&gt;John McCain, Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124716984620819351.html"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly Barack Obama,  which Mark has painstakingly dispatched in a series of posts (links &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1651"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that show that Obama and the other politicians charged with egotism don't actually use first-person pronouns more than other politicians have. (The posts have gotten a gratifying &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS314&amp;amp;q=liberman+obama+pronouns&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;amount of attention&lt;/a&gt; from bloggers and journalists: you could have the hopeful sense that LanguageLog — well, or Mark, to be more precise — is becoming a kind of unofficial linguistic equivalent of the CBO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark lays these misperceptions of pronoun frequency to confirmation bias, which is certainly the obvious conclusion, though I speculate that another factor may play a part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You can't help thinking there's a measure of projection here, as well. Will and Fish are neck and neck for the most immodest style in all of American prose, and it's not surprising that they'd read Obama's impenetrable self-possession as the sign of a bristling ego. When you're a narcissist, every doorknob becomes a mirror. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there's likely to be any slackening of the craze for counting words. As I noted in the piece, the Internet turns everybody into a linguist, the same way it turns us all into medical diagnosticians and tracers of lost persons. On the other hand, the Internet is pretty good at mobilizing the critical spirit, too. Do you suppose the sheer volume of inappropriate or misguided arguments from word counts might motivate more people to wonder what it takes to do this well?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoff Nunberg</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258525226858"><id gr:original-id="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/11/exercise-prevents-regain-of-visceral.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/803f4d664f292ec4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Exercise Prevents Regain of Visceral Fat (But Not Body Weight)</title><published>2009-11-18T00:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-18T00:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/RYQ4ZYv3b7o/exercise-prevents-regain-of-visceral.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/11/exercise-prevents-regain-of-visceral.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Peter and I have often discussed the links between visceral fat and metabolic risk.  Visceral fat is the fat which surrounds the internal organs, and is thought to mediate much of the risk between obesity and disease.  For example, individuals with excess body weight tend to have more visceral fat, which is likely responsible for the relationship between body weight and numerous chronic diseases.  However, as Peter discussed on Monday, subcutaneous fat (the fat beneath the skin) does not seem to have these same negative associations with health.  This means that regardless of body weight, individuals with excess visceral fat tend to be at increased health risk, while those with low amounts of visceral fat tend to be at low risk.  This probably explains why up to 30% of obese individuals are metabolically healthy - these individuals are likely to have lots of subcutaneous fat, but not much visceral fat.

Given this link between visceral fat and chronic disease, it is interesting that exercise preferentially reduces visceral fat.  In other words, even when exercise does not result in reductions in body weight, it still results in reductions in visceral fat (which is likely one reason that exercise results in dramatic health benefits even without a change in body weight).  Perhaps just as importantly, a new study in the journal Obesity suggests that even small amounts of exercise can prevent the accumulation of visceral fat, even when total body weight is increasing....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This week (and by this week I mean the one I got this week, actually dated 6th of November) the topic is the evolutionary origins of religion.

This is quite an interesting topic to which I was first introduced with Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the spell: religion as a natural phenomenom. The central premise is that there could be evolutionary advantages to communities in which individuals follow ways of thinking that can lead to religion. Specifically, it is thought that the thought processes that could lead to religion could also lead towards more cooperation. Recent research has shown that, under very special circumstances, group selection could explain the emergence of features that are somewhat detrimental to an individual that would display them in isolation but that would benefit the community at large [ link ].

Compounded with this is our tendency, as a species, to see agents in every action. When something happens (a noise in the middle of the night) we tend to attribute it to the actions of another being. Evolution could have selected for a way of thinking that, although presents many false positives, tends to be safer. If you hear a strange sound, it is better to think that somebody is around and that you should be careful than to think that the noise you heard was just the wind blowing. This teleological view means that we are predisposed to look for thinking beings in living and nonliving things. Studies with kids or adults in stressful situations seem to confirm this view.

A recent NYT article mentions that the presence of divine beings could be a way to enforce cooperation in small and egalitarian societies of hunter-gatherers. When societies became more complex, with the introduction of agriculture, and religious beliefs were well entrenched in the human neural circuitry, religious beliefs could be co-opted as a source of authority by the ruling classes.

The article also points out that, if religion is an evolved behaviour, it would not be good news to either religious people nor to atheists. Religious people should find that religious beliefs emerging from evolution make God less likely. Atheists might not be so willing to criticise religion if it has evolved as a framework in which cooperation is encouraged. I am not personally convinced that either group will be too discouraged by this. Religious people will probably argue that our religious compass was part of God’s design and that it is precisely that what sets us aside from the rest of the creation. Atheist can argue that the religious instinct, even if the side-effect of other mental processes that could lead to cooperation, is surely not necessary to maintain a complex modern society as it is clear that some of the most cooperative societies in the world today are remarkable secular. Furthermore, this would not address the central premise of atheism which is about the unsuitability of religion to explain truth and nature.

Recall that approximately 30% of individuals who are classified as obese by their body weight turn out to be metabolically healthy, and in fact seem not to get much metabolic benefit (or may even get worse) when they lose weight. Also consider that individuals who have NO fat tissue (e.g. lipodystrophy) have extremely elevated metabolic risk factors, meanwhile others who can apparently indefinitely grow more fat mass (multiple symmetric lipomatosis – think Michelin man) have metabolic profiles we’d all like to have.

The emerging theory of why obesity is associated with disease risk suggests that it is not the excess amount of fat that results in problems – but rather, it is the inability of the fat tissue (specifically subcutaneous, or under the skin fat) to expand enough to store all the excess calories being ingested. In other words, if obese and metabolically unhealthy individuals could somehow develop more subcutaneous fat tissue, they could theoretically become healthier....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The South Australian parliamentarian said he had been contacted by a number of former Scientologists, after he questioned the organisation’s tax exempt status in a recent television interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1134702/Rudd-%27concerned%27-over-Scientology-"&gt;World News Australia SBS reports how the Australian Prime Minister Rudd is ‘concerned’:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asked about the senator’s claims, Mr Rudd described them as “grave allegations”. “Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology,” Mr Rudd told reporters at Bungendore in NSW on Wednesday. “I share some of those concerns. Let us proceed carefully and look carefully at the material he has provided before we make a decision on further parliamentary action.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpKxzWNdONM"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpKxzWNdONM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do we really want to be funding an organisation that turns supporters into victims in its pursuit of power and wealth? That is why I am calling for a Senate inquiry into this organisation and its tax-exempt status. In the past Scientology has claimed that those who question their organisation are attacking the group’s religious freedom. It is twisted logic, to say the least. Religious freedom did not mean the Catholic or Anglican Churches were not held accountable for crimes and abuses committed by their priests, nuns and officials — albeit belatedly. Ultimately, this is not about religious freedom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I agree.  Let's start with the story itself.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first thing to notice in the story is that there is a great deal of repetition.  We are told that Noah is commanded by God to make an ark, load it with food and animals, and then board it. Afterward it says Noah “did everything just as God had commanded him.” (6:14-22).  But after doing all of this once, God repeats similar instructions to Noah, and once again it says Noah “did all that the Lord had commanded him.” (7:1-5). Did Noah make two arks and board them twice?  But we’re not done yet. It goes on to say Noah and his family boarded the ark again (7:7-9), and again (7:13-16). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are also discrepancies in these chapters. In 6:14-22 God is referred to as “Elohim”, and only one pair of each species of animal was put in the ark, whereas in 7:1-5 the word for God is “Yahweh” and Noah is told to put in the ark seven pairs of clean animals and one pair of unclean animals. There are also discrepancies with how long the flood lasted: 40 days (7:17), 150 days (7:24), or one year (compare 7:11 with 8:13)?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biblical scholars now see the way the flood is presented here as reflecting two ancient sources that were combined into one account.  This was done by “following a very conservative principle of keeping virtually everything from both sources, even though that produced considerable repetition” and, I might add, discrepancies.  Donald Gowan, &lt;em&gt;From Eden to Babel: Genesis 1-11 &lt;/em&gt;(Eerdmans, 1988, p. 89). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The closest stories we find to the flood story in the Bible are from Mesopotamia: the Epic of Gilgamesh, and Atrahasis. According to Gordon J. Wenham the Epic of Gilgamesh was written about 1600 B.C. and it “may be based on the flood story told in Atrahasis.” These stories have several striking similarities, including a flood hero, an ark, a universal worldwide flood because of man’s disobedience, and even a dove! [See “Ancient Parallels to the Flood Story,” in Gordon Wenham’s book, &lt;em&gt;Genesis 1-15&lt;/em&gt; (Word, 1987, pp. 159-166).  “These texts are evidence for the transmission of a very popular story from century to century and from people to people; among the recipients of this tradition were the Greeks and the Hebrews.” (Gowan, p. 91). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is the case, then the flood story in the Bible is taken and reshaped to fit the purposes of the final editor of Genesis 1-11.  And if we consider prior sources to be the more authentic sources (and historical scholars consider this to be the case in every other historical investigation), then the true account of the flood (if there is one, and it reflects something that historically happened) is to be found in Atrahasis along with the Epic of Gilgamesh!  Genesis 6-9 is very late and therefore unreliable, historical analysis would reveal.  Atrahasis and the Epic of Gilgamesh would be our primary sources for information about a great universal flood that covered the whole world.  And in them neither a person named Noah, nor a God named “Yaweh,” are to be found!    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How much of the flood story that we find in the Bible can be regarded as historical, if it is based upon ancient superstitious polytheistic folk-tales which were handed down throughout the centuries?—tales which have been told by almost every ancient culture except most of Africa, and in central and eastern Asia? [To read 97 pages of summaries of these tales see Sir James G. Frazer’s book, &lt;em&gt;Folklore in the Old Testament&lt;/em&gt;]. Textual analysis cannot really lead us to think all of these tales speak of the same event. Rather, these tales are told based upon local devastating floods (notice the absence of Egypt!) which most ancient cultures believed were sent by the gods to punish people for their disobedience.  We now know why floods take place, and it isn’t because of our sins, but because of atmospheric, and oceanic conditions.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems Connected to the Flood Story&lt;/strong&gt;.  Bernard Ramm’s critical analysis of a universal flood (while dated a half century ago) is still one of the best summations of the evidence. [See Bernard Ramm’s book, &lt;em&gt;The Christian View of Science and Scripture&lt;/em&gt; (Eerdmans, 1954, pp. 163-169). 1) &lt;strong&gt;“There is no known geological data to support those who defend a universal flood.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gowan sums up the available evidence with these words: “Not only have all archeological excavations failed to uncover any such evidence (for a universal flood), the record of the earth’s history discovered by geology virtually rules out the possibility that anything of that sort has ever happened.” (p. 89).  [There is a recent discovery by Robert Ballard that the Black Sea shoreline increased by 60,000 square miles around 7,500 years ago. But he admits this could have been the result of an earthquake, a massive storm, or perhaps the sheer weight of the ocean waters, none of which demands a worldwide flood (See &lt;em&gt;U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report &lt;/em&gt;“Mysteries of the Bible," November 2004)].  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;“The problems in connection with a universal flood are enormous.”&lt;/strong&gt;  a) “It would have required eight times more water than we now have.”  b) The mixing of salt water and fresh water along with the pressure of the waters would have been devastating to marine life.  Fresh-water fish would die in salt water and salt-water fish would die in fresh water.  The pressure of the water six miles high (to cover the Himalayas) would crush to death the vast bulk of marine life that lives within the first fifty fathoms in the water. c) Getting rid of such a vast amount of water would be impossible—think of it! d) “The astronomical disturbances caused by the increase of the mass of the earth would have been significant.” e) There are improbabilities with regard to the animals involved.  How did Noah get them all into the ark?  Bringing them from all four corners of the globe would take considerable time. How did they get along in the ark?  Some are carnivorous and would be prone to eating the other animals, while others would have vegetarian diets. Where did the food come from to feed all of these animals from around the world?  How could a few people care for them all in the ark?  Some animals need a moist climate, and others a dry one; some need it very cold, while others need it warm. f) After the flood how did these animals all migrate back to their original lands, like the kangaroo, from Australia? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was no universal flood to discount the geological evidence that leads scientists to believe the earth is billions of years old.  According to the &lt;em&gt;Anchor Bible Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, “Scholars are agreed that archaeological evidence for a universal flood in the historical past is wanting.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First posted 2/8/06&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-113943929877607493?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see that I am highly relevant to their demanding criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male &amp;amp; Female&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Investigators who are scientists, explorers, or adventurers with advanced degrees (Ph.D desired).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot damn! I’m a female And I have a PhD! (for reals…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Investigators would already be a team (husband and wife, co- workers) who fall somewhere between the FBI Agents on “The X Files” and “Indiana Jones”. One is a believer, the other a skeptic. One is driven by reason, science and empirical evidence, the other by feelings, intuitions and faith. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the same as being driven by “feelings” that I want to fuck Harrison Ford and driven by “empirical evidence” that I &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2835847820080829"&gt;could fuck David Duchovny&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=5686632"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideally, the woman would be the skeptic and the man the believer. We are not limiting ourselves to an existing team nor will we rule out a woman who is the believer and a man who is the skeptic. We are open to any combination as long as they are articulate, passionate, and knowledgeable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is too uncanny! I too am open to “any combination”! And I’m a female skeptic what is real articulate, kinda passionate and knowledgeable, I guess…&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigators must also be genuinely curious as to why there are predictions in nearly every culture that the world will end in 2012.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe firmly that there are predictions in every Mayan culture that the world will end in 2012. (As long as you don’t ask the Mayans themselves, ’cause they didn’t make up this shit…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS THE DEAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In each episode our Investigators will scour the globe investigating these “End of Days” prophesies and other unexplained mysteries. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These hosts will share their questions, investigative techniques, knowledge and gut instincts with the audience, as they seek answers to some of the world’s oldest and most ominous predictions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If so, WE WANT YOU!!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission video: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a webcam, but I have this little video that my ex-boyfriend and I made together…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1.&lt;br&gt;
Do you think there is any basis in fact for the End of Days Prediction in the Mayan and other cultures. If so, what is the basis of your belief? If not, why not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? Because there is no basis for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2.&lt;br&gt;
How much have you studied 2012 phenomena?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What methodology have you used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the scholarly books on the subject (i.e., none).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3.&lt;br&gt;
Are  you interested in other mysterious and unexplained phenomena?  If so, what  is your methodology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have some 13 years of investigating “mysterious and unexplained phenomena”. If I may be so bold, I am one of the world’s foremost authorities on things that don’t exist…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods I have used include the rhythm method, abstinence, various contraception, and often I just ask him to pull out of me right before he…oh, the scientific method…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 4.&lt;br&gt;
What would you choose to explore regarding either 2012 or other unexplained phenomena?  Oddities, myths, truths?  What methodology would you use? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would choose to explore 2012 and other unexplained phenomena as beliefs, not facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d use an innovative methodology new to the paranormal community (i.e., the scientific method).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5.&lt;br&gt;
What  makes you more unique than other 2012 scholars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…and “2012 scholars” is an oxymoron that amuses me greatly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 6.&lt;br&gt;
Tell  us something else that makes you interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really fucking good in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 7.&lt;br&gt;
Have  you had other television experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had 13 years as a media representative for skeptical organizations, debunking the very sort of shit you promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 8.&lt;br&gt;
What  are your concerns in participating in the project? What are your hopes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My minor concern is that there is no scientific basis for taking your project seriously in any way at all, and that participating in your project could absolutely destroy my entire academic career, even more than me revealing that I’m really fucking good in bed (see Q.5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My “hopes” are that this show never airs, and you are demoted from producer to best boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 9.&lt;br&gt;
How  much time do you have to devote to this series? How flexible is your  schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have all the time it takes to debunk your theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m extremely flexible (see Q.6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 10.&lt;br&gt;
Is  there anything we haven’t asked that you would like to tell us?  If so,  now is your chance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the 2012 theory is a fascinating example of poor research and credulity, and I’d truly love to see a documentary that explores this phenomenon from an historical and skeptical perspective, and applies critical thinking…but this show ain’t it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If so, now is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; chance” to do the right thing…but you won’t…&lt;/p&gt;

I am convinced, however, that as great a meeting as it is, it could always use a little improving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, to improve the quality of the meeting, I suggest a flashmob:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ao4DkbGbxl0%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, what is more amazing than a flashmob?  That's an event that could make someone infamous....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a suggestion for the official conference hotel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/M3T3vzO1_yQ%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the middle of a story, reported by Nancy Marshall Genzer, about &lt;a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/11/17/pm-healthcare/"&gt;opponents of health care reform&lt;/a&gt;, there was an interesting comment that bears on the nature of economics as a scientific discipline.  From the transcript of the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chamber of Commerce is taking a bulldozer to the [health care reform] bill. Yesterday, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported the Chamber is hiring an economist to study the legislation. The goal: more ammunition to sink the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ewe Reinhardt teaches economics at Princeton. He says, if the Chamber does its study, it will probably get the result it wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EWE REINHARDT:&lt;/strong&gt; You can always get an economist with a PhD from a reputable university to give a scientific report that makes your case. So, yes, there will be such a study.&lt;br&gt;

Right now, a signficant fraction of the astronomical community is involved in crafting “multicycle” proposals for the telescope.  The idea is that there are probably useful projects that are &lt;em&gt;sooooo&lt;/em&gt; time consuming that you couldn’t possibly do them through normal proposal channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the race is on!  Here’s the data on what I know of so far.  We’re up to 8 proposals at 24 hours before the deadline.  With the enormous sample of two, count ‘em, two data points, we’re on the same curve as we were for Cycle 17 (plotted in black), but scaled down by a factor of 27.  The blue line is extrapolating an exponential to the current rate of proposal submission.  Both tracks argue for about 30 proposals going in.  The scaling factor of 27 suggests that there will be an average of 27 people on each proposal, if &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2008/03/underover.php"&gt;Steinn’s argument&lt;/a&gt; that the number of proposals is set solely by the size of the community holds.  The late-time development of this curve could be way off, however, because there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way to put one of these together at the last minute.  (On the other hand, the proposed experiments are so immensely complicated, that maybe the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way you get them done is waiting until the last minute).&lt;/p&gt;

It’s time to change his show’s name to &amp;quot;Antireality Time&amp;quot;. Because &lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;when he talks vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, he wanders into major woowoo territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to debunk his antivax nonsense, since actual doctors who have facts at their fingertips do it so well, like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/bill_maher_flames_out_over_vaccines.php"&gt;in this tirade from Orac&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1238"&gt;Steve Novella’s more measured (but just as devastating) response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one thing I want to mention. My favorite part is when Maher says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I agree with my critics who say there are far more qualified people than me — its [sic] just that mainstream media rarely interviews doctors and scientists who present an alternative point of view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, that’s total baloney. Go watch the news and other talking head shows; they often have people talking up the &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; (that is to say, wrong) point of view when it comes to vaccines. And if these people aren’t certified physicians, what does that tell you? Maybe you’ll come to the correct conclusion that the overwhelming majority of physicians think antivaxxers are full of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And second, about talk shows not having &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; viewpoints — and this is critical — &lt;em&gt;why should they?&lt;/em&gt; When the weatherman talks about lightning in your area, should he give equal time to the Zeus theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feh. Maher digs himself deeper every time he talks about this. Some people hold him up as an icon of skepticism, but it’s simply not true. A lot of non-believers love his ideas and attitude when it comes to religion, which is fine, but it doesn’t translate to his other beliefs, especially when it comes to real medicine. What he does isn’t skepticism, it’s dogma, and just as dogmatic as the religions he mocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258503294040"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/x9MceGCCIug/men_arent_always_less_sociable.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71d0bb87eb5d2cf8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Men often treat their friends better than women do</title><published>2009-11-17T17:28:28Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T17:28:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/-9vvCchnad4/men_arent_always_less_sociable.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/x9MceGCCIug/men_arent_always_less_sociable.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Who's more "sociable," men or women? Common sense says it's women, right? And many research studies back this impression up: Women are more interpersonal, more connected, more interdependent than men. Women are more likely to share intimate information with each other than men. But is that really the whole story?

There is also research suggesting that men have larger social networks than women do, and that male-male friendships last longer than female-female ones.

A team led by Joyce Benenson conducted a set of three studies that may shed some light on the question. In their first study, they identified 30 male and 30 female undergraduates at a small, Northeastern U.S. college. Half of each group was specifically recruited because they said they had some kind of conflict with their roommate. The other half said they were planning on living with their roommate for the rest of the school year. Each student was asked to rate their satisfaction with their roommate on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 4 or 5 was defined by the researchers as "satisfied." So were there gender differences? Here are the results:

The male students were significantly more likely to be satisfied with their roommates than female students, whether or not they had a conflict with their roommate. The students also rated their roommates on social interaction, interests, values, and hygiene, and male students gave significantly higher ratings for their roommates than females for every category except hygiene.

In a second study, the researchers surveyed three separate institutions to see how frequently male and female students requested to change roommates. Here are those results:

As you can imagine, it's gone down about as well as a Jan Moir lecture on ethics at a Boyzone funeral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity, and other bloggers at my occasional holiday retreat "Liberal Conspiracy", have written &lt;a href="http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2009/11/17/blogging-and-pcc-regulation-a-collective-response/"&gt;an open letter to Baroness Buscombe at the PCC &lt;/a&gt;which reads as follows (well, I may be paraphrasing slightly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Ms. Buscombe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCC are a useless fat waste of shit. Yes, that's right, shit is too valuable to use up creating the gigantic mountain of excrement that is your shabby organization, which by the way is about as effective a regulator as a drunk barman at an all-you-can drink happy hour. Your ideas stink and your Mom sucks. We're not playing with you! Sod off! Rargh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours&lt;br&gt;
The Blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be fair, they have a pretty good point. I can't deny that the PCC is indeed about as effective a regulator as a drunk barman at an all-you-can drink happy hour. A drunk barman with a history of drinking problems. Who just broke up from his wife. And got diagnosed with leprosy. At his Mum's funeral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's what makes this proposal so &lt;i&gt;attractive&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I explain that statement though, there is another elephant in the room that needs dealing with. The PCC already regulates newspapers and magazines, including their &lt;em&gt;online versions&lt;/em&gt;. This raises an important question - what is the difference between a blog and a magazine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, why shouldn't Liberal Conspiracy play by the same rules as an online magazine or newspaper? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between blog and magazine is tricky, and it strikes close to home. The Lay Scientist was an individual blog until two months ago, with a couple of guest-bloggers. Now we have over 25 writers, three or four articles a day, and a more magazine-like format. Is this website a blog or a magazine? If it isn't an online magazine, at what stage does it become one? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might argue that this is pedantry and doesn't matter, but the problem is that writers here and at LibCon have called for the PCC to act against online articles on newspaper websites. If we refuse to submit ourselves to even the basic standard of self-regulation that newspapers do, are we in danger of being hypocrites? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's a diversion. The main thrust of Unity's argument is that the PCC is crap anyway, that in many ways it's an insult to ask blogs to get involved in such a piss-poor and ineffective regulatory effort. I agree, but this argument overlooks some very important points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCC have been useless for years. They were useless when they were the Press Council, and they were useless when they reformed as the PCC. They have a history of uselessness. Why? Because like many efforts at industry self-regulation, they tend to do &lt;em&gt;just enough&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, Alan Rusbridger has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/17/guardian-editor-resigns-pcc"&gt;today resigned &lt;/a&gt;claiming that they don't even do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are manned by a stale group of insiders, with little interest in rocking the boat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the PCC needs is change. What the PCC needs is fresh blood to move in and shake things up. What better solution then to fill a syringe with new media magic and jab it straight into their cold, dying heart? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as British bloggers are not compelled by law to submit to regulations - and to my knowledge there is absolutely no serious suggestion that they ever would be - then the voluntary participation of leading bloggers in the PCC could in principle be an excellent idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would allow bloggers to subvert the existing status quo from within, a prospect that becomes increasingly likely as bloggers gain more prominence in the public arena; and if suitably reformed it could provide a useful badge of distinction to mark out those bloggers willing to abide by a sensible set of of principles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course caveats - there always are. An attempt to force the regulation of blogging via the back door would be unacceptable, and if we ended up reforming the PCC by adding Iain Dale to the board I think I'd probably just slit my wrists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the PCC is already a broken system. Buscombe's plan, as crazy as it may seem at first glance, could provide an opportunity for bloggers to play a part in reforming it. As long as we retain our independence, and the right to withdraw from any such scheme, it's an idea that we shouldn't just instinctively reject. In doing so we may miss a great opportunity for reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, just possibly, I'm being hopelessly naive. In which case, I'm sure you'll tell me in 3... 2... 1...  &lt;/p&gt;

As you can imagine, it's gone down about as well as a Jan Moir lecture on ethics at a Boyzone funeral. &lt;/p&gt;

There are three Nobel Laureates who might be associated with the creature but two of them have already been covered. The last name of the this week's Nobel Laureate does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; begin with the letters "E" or "D".

Consequently, I have two extra free lunches for deserving undergraduates. I'm going to award an &lt;u&gt;additional&lt;/u&gt; prize to the first &lt;u&gt;undergraduate student&lt;/u&gt; who can accept it. Please indicate in your email message whether you are an undergraduate and whether you can make it for lunch.

&lt;p&gt;Unless…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to use this stamp against them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would find it almost poetic if you could use a BSA stamp to send their headquarters your resignation form… if such a thing existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can come up with better ideas?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days, Lee was asserting that people have only so many “gigabytes” in their brains to devote to languages.  Though admitting that speaking “dialects” in some situations can provide “extra warmth,” he warned that, by using such languages, “You are losing important neurons with data which should not be there. And like the computer, when you delete it, it doesn’t really go away. It’s there at the back, and you’ve got to go to the rubbish channel and say ‘destroy.’ And it’s still disturbing your hard disk.”  (&lt;a href="http://pinyin.info/news/2009/dialects-wasting-important-neurons-needed-for-mandarin-english-lee-kuan-yew/"&gt;See this useful summary&lt;/a&gt; and detailed list of references by Mark Swofford.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, those &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;rubbish languages must be destroyed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “dialects” must be let go, he intimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, however, the Minister Mentor (MM) is singing a completely different tune.  Here's &lt;a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1018826/1/.html"&gt;one recent article&lt;/a&gt; with some delicious, pertinent quotes.  Now Lee admits that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;his insistence on bilingualism in the early years of education policy was "wrong". Instead it has caused generations of students to be put off by the Chinese language &lt;span&gt;[VHM:  by which MM means, of course, Mandarin, not Hakka or Hokkien or Cantonese, etc.]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking first in Mandarin and then in English at the official opening of the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language on Tuesday, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew gave a blunt assessment of Singapore's bilingual policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said: &amp;quot;We started the wrong way. We insisted on ting xie (listening), mo xie (dictation) — madness! We had teachers who were teaching in completely-Chinese schools. And they did not want to use any English toteach English-speaking children Chinese and that turned them off completely.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these overly forceful policies, students balked at learning Mandarin and flocked to English more enthusiastically than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM Lee (who is of Hakka and Hokkien ancestry, though his best language appears to be English, and he has long struggled to acquire full fluency in Mandarin) goes on to advance some rather dubious ideas about sexual differences in language learning ability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr Lee added: "At first I thought, you can master two languages. Maybe different intelligence, you master it at different levels."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But his conclusions now, after over 40 years of learning Mandarin, cannot be more different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;MM Lee said: "Nobody can master two languages at the same level. If (you think) you can, you're deceiving yourself. My daughter is a neurologist, and late in my life she told me language ability and intelligence are two different things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Girls are better at languages because their left side of the brain to learn languages [sic], as a general rule, is better than the boys. Boys have great difficulty, and I had great difficulty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifts in Singaporean language policy are as changeable as the winds that blow across the harbor there.  Regardless of what MM may be thinking at any given moment, we can be sure that the current status of English (far and away the main language), Malay, Mandarin, Hakka, Hokkien, Cantonese, Tamil, Singlish, and the other languages spoken there will not remain static.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258498570966"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=2031">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e689a37edf82546</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Talks"/><category term="The Parasite Files"/><category term="The Tangled Bank"/><title type="html">Vancouver BC: Infection Commences Tomorrow</title><published>2009-11-17T21:39:27Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T21:39:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/11/17/vancouver-bc-infection-commences-tomorrow/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/events/lectures/images/zimmer.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="410"&gt;I’m waiting to board my Air Canada flight to the rain-drenched city of Vancouver.

As I read that sentence, I realize that it is entirely uninteresting.  I pick the kid up from preschool all the time. What a poorly crafted sentence..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Little Isis's preschool, outside of his classroom, there is a whiteboard where his teachers write about what the children did that day.  Yesterday the message read, "We are teaching the children about germs and how to stay healthy.  Please ask ask them what the Number One Rule is when you get home."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you've been reading the blog for any length of time, you know how I feel about rules.  I couldn't help myself.  The promise of a &lt;em&gt;Number One &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Rule was simply to delicious. As soon as we walked out of the classroom I had to ask, "Little Isis, what is the Number One Rule?"  To which he replied proudly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't pick your nose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, as far as rules go, that's a pretty good one.  I think I'm alright with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll get some doomcriers in the comments. If you really think the Mayan calendar says the world will end in 2012, then I strongly urge you to read Aveni’s book. He’s an actual Mayan scholar, he knows his stuff, and he’s not out to either scare you or reassure you: he’s out to tell the truth. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258494919368"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/mastering_iptables_the_movie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a9662bc549bbb92c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Mastering IPTables: The Movie</title><published>2009-11-17T21:25:57Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T21:25:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/_9p4FcFc1AA/mastering_iptables_the_movie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/mastering_iptables_the_movie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;First, blotto one light bulb to appease the gods:&lt;/p&gt;

One of the unique aspects of high-volume online businesses is that you have access to a wealth of data and ways to use it that a lot of traditional offline establishments don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best examples is the ability to track your advertising spend. John Wanamaker famously once said “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” He obviously wasn’t making websites. Giving customers who view ads a special URL, then using that to set a flag in the database and make special reports detailing exactly how much Revenue Per User (RPU) one gets is de rigueur online. You’d be hard pressed to find any web-based business spending more than $10 a day in ads that doesn’t know how much revenue they’re generating with that money to the cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about offline businesses who advertise online while doing all of their sales from a brick and mortar establishment? I was recently talking to the ad director of a local chain of tire shops who mentioned that they need to find ways of tracking the customers who click through their ads and end up buying tires from the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers who come in via email or the contact form on the web aren’t too hard. You’d simply track them up through the point of contact the same way any online business would, then make sure whoever handles them in store puts the appropriate flag in the user system. But what about the surprisingly large number of people who still make their first contact the old fashioned way, via telephone? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where Google Voice comes in. Google Voice (formerly Grand Central, which I was an early user of) allows anyone to get a second phone number which forwards to their original one. It has great built in message handling and call tracking, which would help an offline business track customers through that portion of the sales funnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it would work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob’s Tire Shack gets one Google Voice number for each of their stores. Bob purchases Facebook ads pointing to a special URL which then stores a session variable indicating that the user came from a Facebook ad. When a user clicks through to the contact page, it gives them the Google Voice number, given only to customers who came to the website through the special URL, rather than the store’s normal number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone calls to set up an appointment Bob can then tell which number they called, and therefore whether or not they came from a Facebook ad. It will be much more accurate than simply asking people “how did you hear about us?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could work across a variety of channels simply by getting different numbers, which Google sells fairly cheaply. &lt;/p&gt;

If you sit around during a typical shower, you might see anywhere from 50 to 100 meteors an hour, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the Moon isn't out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/look_up_tonight_leonid_meteor/leonid-meteor.jpg" width="500" title="Good one!" alt="leonid-meteor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a time-lapse photograph and look for meteors, you will, sometimes, get a great view of what's going on.  Although it isn't immediately clear what's a meteor and what's a passing satellite or airplane, you can tell them apart in this video by looking for the "instant" streaks, which are meteors, versus the ones that streak for many frames, which are satellites or aircrafts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/903546/time_lapse_of_the_perseid_meteor_shower_geminid.swf&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=345" width="400" height="345"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the Leonids peak tonight, and &lt;a href="http://www.teri-hatcher.com/SEINFELD93/seinfeld9314.jpg"&gt;they are spectacular&lt;/a&gt;.  Instead of getting one or two meteors a minute, we should get -- on average -- a meteor &lt;i&gt;every five to ten seconds&lt;/i&gt;!  What's more?  The peak, tonight, is at around 3 AM Eastern Standard Time (Midnight Pacific Standard Time).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better?  The Moon is practically new tonight.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/look_up_tonight_leonid_meteor/1557OldMoon-NewMoon.jpg" width="500" title="Actually, the new Moon was *last* night, but it won&amp;#39;t obscure your view tonight!" alt="1557OldMoon-NewMoon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that only a tiny crescent will be in the sky, and it'll be gone by an hour or two after sunset.  Which means, if you get clear skies, you'll have &lt;b&gt;ideal meteor shower conditions!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where should you look on the sky?  Near the constellation Leo; the meteors will emanate from there.  (Ignore Saturn in the image below; it was there in 2006, but isn't in 2009.  The stars are still in the same place, though.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/look_up_tonight_leonid_meteor/leonids.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/look_up_tonight_leonid_meteor/leonids.jpg" width="500" title="Click me to enlarge me!" alt="leonids.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at its peak, we should get about &lt;b&gt;500 meteors per hour&lt;/b&gt;, which is huge.  If you get to see it remember to thank &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55P/Tempel-Tuttle"&gt;Comet Tempel Tuttle&lt;/a&gt; for coming through in 1998 and leaving this beautiful debris trail for us.

&lt;p&gt;All of it makes for a beautiful sight this night!  So go out and enjoy it, and know that I'll be jealous here in cloudy Portland!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/look_up_tonight_leonid_meteor.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258492284703"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/i_get_email_47.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d37c7408a6158a40</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2009-11-17T20:11:27Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T20:11:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XPhChalJWsE/i_get_email_47.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/i_get_email_47.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wondered what the creationists were doing after &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/that_bergman-myers_debate.php"&gt;last night's debate&lt;/a&gt;, when all the godless rationalists were partying down. They were composing a condescending letter to rationalize away their defeat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what Ross Olson of the Twin Cities Creation Science Association sent me and Mark Borrello and Jerry Bergman this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank you all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to you all for keeping the debate on a courteous intellectual level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously not all the questions were addressed but the event illustrated that it can be extremely valuable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Myers, you have a unique position, with your immensely popular blog, to change the whole complexion of the discussion.    Remember how you treated Dr. Bergman on your blog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Monday, 16 November, I'm going to be doing a debate. I hate debates, but I've been dragged into this one. It's being promoted by the local creationist loons and CASH, and I'd like to see a good turnout from the sensible, scientific, godless community. I'll be arguing with a loud clown, Jerry Bergman, on "Should Intelligent Design Be Taught in the Schools?" I think you can guess which side I'm going to be on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can, by the power of example and occasional criticism of overzealous followers, turn the blog into an actual forum of ideas.  It would be a great contribution to the intellectual world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be addressed is your claim that evolution adds information.  That needs to be supported.  Your closing remarks about evolutionary research into the beak changes of Darwin's Finches need to be answered with the point that they are still finches and the changes cycle with changing environmental conditions.  The only point at which the crowd got rowdy was with the mention of evolution's influence on Hitler.  Actually, that issue is not solved by shouting because there is a strong case that the desire to improve the race leads to eugenic and ethnic cleansing policies.  Indeed, your claim that morality comes from our culture needs to answer the question, "What if my culture is the Mafia?"  Other evolutionary apologists have candidly pointed out that the only morality that can come out of evolution is that I leave my genes, as many of them as possible, to the next generation.  Also, a truly interactive academic blog would allow posting of the studies on the academic success of students exposed to both evolution and intelligent design.  You have consistently claimed that those students who do not get pure evolution will fail, but without offering any experimental or observational data.  And to claim that evidence against evolution does not represent evidence for intelligent design needs closer analysis.  There is a logical dichotomy involved.  Life either has a natural origin or not.  If not, then the origin must come from outside natural mechanisms.  You can claim that we just don't know, but while waiting, need to entertain the possibility that there is a cause outside of nature.  To say there can be no such thing is not a scientific statement or even a logical one but an a priori elimination of one whole field of inquiry.  Your redefinition of vestigial organs as reduced function may get some traction but is not the way they were presented 100 years ago, but there is no doubt that "Junk DNA' was clearly touted as evolutionary leftovers and delayed the search for function, which was predicted by Intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you have not only personally attacked Dr. Bergman, you have allowed your followers to misrepresent his qualifications by focusing on the institution granting one of his PhDs.    Here is a CV:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M.P.H., Northwest Ohio Consortium for Public Health (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio; University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio; Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio), 2001.&lt;br&gt;
M.S. in biomedical science, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio, 1999.&lt;br&gt;
Ph.D. in human biology, Columbia Pacific University, San Rafael, California, 1992.&lt;br&gt;
M.A. in social psychology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1986.&lt;br&gt;
Ph.D. in measurement and evaluation, minor in psychology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, 1976.&lt;br&gt;
M.Ed. in counseling and psychology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, 1971.&lt;br&gt;
B.S., Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, 1970. Major area of study was sociology, biology, and psychology.&lt;br&gt;
A.A. in Biology and Behavioral Science, Oakland Community College, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, 1967.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your case is strong, students will be enriched by being allowed to see it interact with the opposition.  And your call for punishment of those who reject the ruling paradigm conflicts with the view of science as growing and self correcting.  How can purveyors of new ideas work hard to establish them if they are not allowed to do so?  Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions pointed out that it is very difficult for those entrenched in the establishment to change and paradigm shifts come with generational revolutions by those whose life work and reputations are not tied to the current model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Borrello, because you have participated in a debate with me, I know you are in favor of interactions and Dr. Bergman, I know you not only are in favor of dialogue but would be delighted to bring this to the next level.  Because you have been willing to change in the past, you have demonstrated that data makes a difference to you and I dare say that you might even refine some of the arguments you made at the debate given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Dr. Myers, are you willing to take your debate persona and transplant it to the Blogosphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross Olson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does he really think I treated Bergman&amp;#39;s ideas with less contempt in the debate than I do on the blog? Trust me, the reputation I have on the internet that I seem to rip off my enemies&amp;#39; heads with my claws and slake my thirst at the spurting stump of their neck does not accord well with reality — I do the same thing here on the blog that I did last night, it&amp;#39;s just a little more obvious in person that there is a human being behind these words. Mr Olson really needs to face up to the fact that all that happened was that the paladin-for-hire he brought into my backyard to knock me off my high horse showed up in rusty armor, wielding a bladder-onna-stick, and got his ass kicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His long paragraph of creationist fallacies up there doesn't save face for him, it merely makes him look ridiculous. I think I'll take it apart later, but right now I'm trying to get caught up on other matters, and giving three talks over the course of this long weekend has left me a little fatigued. Have no fear, I'll treat it appropriately, and my thirst will be slaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Bergman's CV, it's &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt;. It's a potted history of a dilettante striving for legitimacy with a random array of diplomas on his wall. I'm really unimpressed; I'm much more impressed with the single degree of a freshly-minted graduate student who has demonstrated some depth and fervor for an idea than that fuzzy flibbertigibbet's list of hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please don't invoke Kuhn. Creationists are not the heralds of a coming paradigm shift; they are the rotting detritus of the old regime of unreason that has haunted the human race for far too long. There's a difference between maintaining an open environment that encourages fresh new ideas to emerge and tolerating the sloppy housecleaning that allows moldy scum to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

You'd think that
after all of the bad math I've written about, I must have reached the point where 
I wouldn't be surprised at the sheer innumeracy of most people - even most supposedly
educated people. But alas for me, I'm a hopeless idealist. I just never quite
manage to absorb how clueless the average person is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today in the New York Times, there's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/opinion/17tue2.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=opinion"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; which talks about
the difficulties faced by the children of immigrants. In the course of
their argument, they describe  what they claim is the difference between 
the academic performance of native-born versus immigrant children:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whereas native-born children's language skills follow a bell
curve, immigrants' children were crowded in the lower ranks: More than
three-quarters of the sample scored below the 85th percentile in English
proficiency.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Scoring in the 85th percentile on a test means that you did better on that
test than 85 percent of the people who took it. So for the population &lt;em&gt;as a
whole&lt;/em&gt;, 85% of the people who took it scored below the 85th percentile -
&lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt;. So, if the immigrant population were perfectly matched
with the population as a whole, then you'd expect &lt;em&gt;more than&lt;/em&gt; 3/4s the
score below the 85th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As they reported it, the most reasonable conclusion would be that on the
whole, immigrant children do &lt;em&gt;better than&lt;/em&gt; native-born children! The
population of test takers consists of native-born children and immigrant
children. (There's no third option - if you're going to school here, either
you were born here, or you weren't.) If 3/4s of immigrant children are scoring
85th percentile or below, then that means that &lt;em&gt;more than&lt;/em&gt; 85% of 
the non-immigrant children are scoring below 85th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I have no idea where they're getting their data. Nor do I have any idea of
what they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; they were saying. But what they actually said is a
mind-boggling stupid thing, and I can't imagine how anyone who had the most
cursory understanding of what it actually meant would miss the fact that
the statistic doesn't in any way, shape, or form support the statement it's
attached to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The people who write the editorials for the New York Times don't even
know what percentiles mean. It's appalling. It's worse that appalling - it's
an absolute disgrace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/11/shameful_innumeracy_in_the_new.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/r6KuGwBYdDs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258489889036"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=1856">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19cbfcfd011b54e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">A Treeline Story</title><published>2009-11-17T20:03:44Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T20:03:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/a-treeline-story/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of the highest growing trees in the world are also the oldest—bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva) from the Great Basin in the western United States (eastern California, Nevada and Utah).  The oldest example is more than 4800 years old.  Because of their longevity and growth at high elevations (where the growth of trees is generally known to be limited by temperature) bristlecone pines have been of particular interest to dendroclimatologists (paleoclimatologists who study tree rings to reconstruct past climate).  Numerous ecological studies carried out at treeline sites all over the world show that temperature imposes a critical limitation on the ability of trees to produce new tissue; mean daily temperatures of 8-9°C are required, so recent warming will have particular benefits for those trees that have managed to eke out an existence for so long, living “on the edge”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting characteristic of the western bristlecone pines is that their recent growth has markedly increased—ring widths have been higher than in previous decades.  Previous studies have debated to what extent this “fact” is real, or just an artifact of the way tree-ring data are analyzed.  Because the growth of trees is radial, as trees get older and the diameter of a tree increases, annual ring widths decline in thickness.  This is the normal “growth function” that is commonly removed from measurements before further analysis is carried out.  The trick is to do this carefully so that as much climate information is retained while the growth function is discarded, and dendroclimatologists know how to do this quite well.  However, sometimes the “standardization” procedure can introduce spurious results.  This led some to regard the apparent growth increase in bristlecone pines to be a meaningless result of the data processing.  In a &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/13/0903029106.abstract?sid=1c81cc57-d8a5-47ac-9652-9664d86f01cf"&gt;new article in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (PNAS) Matthew Salzer (Laboratory of Tree Ring Research, University of Arizona) and colleagues examine this issue head on.  They studied hundreds of trees from treeline sites in the Great Basin, aligned all the samples according to date, and simply averaged the results (Figure 1).  Given that these trees are all long-lived, the complicating factor of growth function (which is strongest for the early growth of a tree) was not significant for assessing the most recent growth.  Their results show that mean ring width in the last 50 years has been greater than in any previous 50 year period over the last 3700 years.  You have to go all the way back to ~1900-1300 B.C. to find mean ring widths approaching recent values.   Furthermore, the recent increase in ring widths is seen in trees at the upper forest border at sites hundreds of km away (even when the treelines there were at lower elevations)—but not in trees below the upper forest border. Below the zone closest to treeline, wide rings are formed in cool, wet years, and narrow rings in warm, dry years, and trees from this lower zone do not show the 20th century growth surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   It is thus clear that the bristlecone pines from the highest regions, close to their growth limit, are showing a very strong response to recent warming, and indicating just how unusual it has been in the context of the last few millennia.  Previous explanations have focused on possible CO2 fertilization effects (increasing water use efficiency) but there is no obvious reason why such factors would have affected only trees within approximately 150m of local treeline in different locations.  Rather, the high elevation trees, close to the limit of growth, have responded positively to the recent increase in temperature just as ecological studies would have predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: bristlecone pines often have an unusual growth form known as “strip bark morphology” in which annual growth layers are restricted to only parts of a tree’s circumference.  Some studies have suggested that such trees be avoided for paleoclimatic purposes, a point repeated in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/06/national-academies-synthesis-report/"&gt;National Academy of Sciences report&lt;/a&gt; (Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years.  NRC, 2006).  However Salzer et al’s study shows that there is no significant difference in their results when the data are divided into two classes—strip bark and non-strip-bark cases –when the raw unstandardized data are compared.  So that particular issue has apparently had people barking up the wrong tree…&lt;br&gt;

Most blend in with their surroundings and we don’t even realize that we see them anymore, but some of them catch the eye. The ones catching the most flack in recent years are those supporting atheism. They go up and are pulled right back down in most cases. There was one in my city [Philadelphia] a year or so ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="atheist-billboard" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/atheist-billboard.jpg" alt="atheist-billboard" width="467" height="316"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know exactly how long it remained on the side of I-95N, but I don’t think I saw it more than 3 times. There are more examples of billboards across the country, attempting to make those who don’t believe feel more comfortable about coming out of the closet so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that the ones that have gotten put up and left in place for longer than a weekend have made a difference. The problem is in the double standard. There are a whole lot more billboards promoting churches and religion in general, but there is no epic battle to have them removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last one is my favorite. Because we all know how opposed to science atheists tend to be.&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; So I ask you, lovely readers, what you would do if granted public advertisement rights via billboard. (It doesn’t have to relate to atheism, BTW.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’ve been given billboard space in a well-travelled area and carte blanche on its content. What does it say?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big “thank you” to Steve DeGroof for the topic idea. I asked for help in my grumbly morning grogginess and he kindly obliged. Thanks!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For such a serious subject, the evening produced a lot of laughs with the Professor, his fellow guest Dr. Evan Harris MP and visitor Dr. Ben Goldacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Nutt started by restating the basics of the area: there are different legal classes of drugs (medical etc) and whether their use was restricted. And that the original intent of restricting drug use was to reduce harm by having a system of relative based harm and appropriate penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke specifically about ecstasy and cannabis, reminding us that neither of them was harmless, but that we needed an empirical approach to measure precisely what harm they caused. Both substances seem to be good case studies of how political fervour can trump empirical evidence. Queen Victoria used cannabis for pain during childbirth, and “MDMA only got banned when people started having fun with it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government implementation of drugs policy has changed significantly over the years. In what many people regard as an ideologically driven era, even the Thatcher government of the 80s was in fact more evidence based in this area: it implemented needle programs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, prior to the issue of cannabis being reclassified, the advice of the ACMD had only been rejected once since 1971. But in modern times, we appear to have other motivators for policy. Two seemed particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the undoubted power of the tabloid press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the attitude of the police, which appears to have changed since the ‘90s when they seemed interested in downgrading MDMA (E) and cannabis because of a lack of public disorder consequences. This has changed and it’s not entirely clear why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are other (than health) serious consequences to using drugs, and getting a criminal record is prime among them. Professor Nutt cited an Australian program where cannabis was decriminalised: it apparently improved users’ relationships with the police, made them more able to seek help for substance dependency and (perhaps most of all) improved users’ employment prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evan Harris MP started his presentation deeply abashed:&lt;br&gt;
“I never smoked pot. It’s embarrassing … I was never offered it. It wasn’t big in my chess club”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So clearly inexperienced, but with nerd credentials intact (chess?!), Dr Harris continued by describing himself as a “yappy dog around the ankles of, usually, health secretaries”. His forays into evidence-based health policy had started with questioning the two-week referral time for a possible cancer (apparently, the money spent doesn’t produce the best outcomes). Since then he has tackled emotive, polarising and tabloid-friendly subjects, such as drug-induced early-stage abortion and prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With prostitution, for example, the ‘demand for prostitution’ offence in which police target potential clients has been cited as a concern in the NHS (I’m afraid I didn’t catch the specific citation). There is good reason to suspect that legal measures which alienate the women and their profession further will increase their vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harris freely admits that governments have many, and often good, reasons for certain policies, ideology, public opinion and financial considerations among them. But when these are the real motivations, a government must admit to that, rather than attempting to dictate or discard scientific advice &amp;amp; evidence. Although there are notable exceptions (he cited Dr. Lynne Jones MP, Paul Flynn MP and Charles Clarke MP), he feels that this parliamentary Labour party doesn’t really understand evidence based policy: do they think a peer review is “A Baroness casting an eye across something”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reports of conversations with members of the government sounded frustratingly meandering and circular. And he was clearly appalled at the timing of Professor Nutt’s famous rebuke from Jacqui Smith, the then Home Secretary, which coincided with her expenses scandal. Anybody trying to knock herself off the front pages, by any chance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Science and Technology committee, it is to be hoped that Dr. Harris can help to make a change. Next week, a set of principles for the treatment of independent scientific advice will go to Lord Drayson for his consideration. See Sense About Science for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening was fascinating and funny: did you know that you are statistically more likely to suffer a reaction to peanuts than to MDMA? We were all tickled by the complaints of a Dutch cannabis researcher in the audience who complained bitterly that her subjects had scoffed all her biscuits. And Professor Nutt dispelled some of the softer attitudes to heroin use by reminding us that it is a potent respiratory depressor which causes many accidental deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the most interesting aspects was the role that the media, especially the tabloids have to play. Both speakers managed to convey a sense of how the government is driven by fear of the tabloids and it is, to a certain extent, understandable. Newspapers clearly have an idea of what they regard as a sexy subject, there being a massive weighting of fatality reports toward the narcotic ‘bete du jour’*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One the other hand, surveys reveal that the public are often considerably more liberal than those ministers running scared of newspapers. So who buys the news and votes as they’re told? “Who is the constituency for stupid drug laws?”, as one audience member asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were all stumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that last night’s proceedings managed principally to convey that science mangled to provide a justification for policy dishonours both government and science. As Evan Harris always says to Anne Widdecombe about sex education:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Nutt started by restating the basics of the area: there are different legal classes of drugs (medical etc); whether their use was restricted; that the original intent of restriction was to reduce harm by having a system of relative based harm and appropriate penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

You know, the usual for a science blogger: get a tattoo, hang out with a man crush, watch a live taping of a smash hit comedy show, meet and greet with TV execs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one very cool thing that happened was that while watching the taping of one of my favorite shows, &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/"&gt;&amp;quot;The Big Bang Theory&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, I met &lt;a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~saltzbrg/bio.html"&gt;David Saltzberg&lt;/a&gt;. David’s a physicist and astronomer who has serious bona fides in science. All that is very cool and all, but most importantly as far as I’m concerned is that he is the official science consultant on BBT. This is basically my dream job, so I’m very jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/artwork/8/3/0/2/7/83027/Saltzberg_-left_-and-exec-p.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/Saltzberg_Prady.jpg" alt="Saltzberg_Prady" title="Saltzberg_Prady" width="227" height="256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But not bitter, because David’s a great guy. We met up on the set and immediately started chatting and having fun. And to cement himself in my pantheon of Very Cool People, he gave me his copy of the script so I could follow along with the show. Whoa! [Bill Prady, the co-Executive Producer of the show, also gave me a copy of the script for my daughter; Bill and David are the ones in the picture, courtesy CBS, from &lt;a href="http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/making-a-big-bang-on-tv-10-questions-83027.aspx"&gt;a UCLA article interviewing David&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you watch the show, take a look at the whiteboards littering the character’s apartments and offices. They always show a barrage of equations, notes, and diagrams. Those are all real! Yup, David’s work. When Sheldon and Raj argue over dark matter detection, or Leonard spouts off a line about physics, the core science is from David’s brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very wise and fun move, David has started a blog tying the science in the episodes to what’s currently known in the field, using BBT as a springboard to explain real cutting-edge stuff. It’s called &lt;a href="http://thebigblogtheory.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Big Blog Theory&lt;/a&gt; (also available &lt;a href="http://thebigblogtheoryesp.wordpress.com/"&gt;en Español&lt;/a&gt;), and is a great read. if you’re a fan of the show, and a total science nerd (and as I always point out, if you read my blog then congrats! You’re a nerd) then you should put Big Blog Theory on your must read list. It adds a dimension to the show that otherwise wouldn’t be accessible except through ten-dimensional matrix transformations of the standard general relativistic metric, and while those are trivial to do it’s a step you now don’t need to take.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, many theories have been proposed for its ancient purpose, ranging from being a place to allow plant matter to ferment to being a locale for crushed bones to be dissolved.

However, recent evidence posits that the appendix plays a crucial role in maintaining important gut symbionts. ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Bergman said "yes" and PZ said "no."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read summaries of the debate on &lt;i&gt;Greg Laden's Blog&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/bergman_vs_myers_debate_should.php"&gt;Bergman vs. Myers Debate: Should Intelligent Design be Taught in The Schools?&lt;/a&gt;] and on &lt;i&gt;Kittywhumpus&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://kittywhumpus.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-thought-it-went-really-well-until-he.html"&gt;I thought it went really well, until he brought up Hitler&lt;/a&gt;]. PZ has posted a summary on &lt;i&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/that_bergman-myers_debate.php"&gt;That Bergman-Myers debate&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By all accounts it was a rout. PZ won the day for keeping Intelligent Design Creationism out of the classroom. It was like shooting fish in a barrel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd like to debate PZ on this topic. I think Intelligent Design Creationism has to be brought up in the classroom. It's the major misconception that students have and to ignore it is stupid. You have to address the issues that students are confused about or you aren't educating. It's one thing to say that Intelligent Design Creationism isn't science when you are outside of the classroom but unless the students hear it in the classroom you are wasting your time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are never going to make progress against scientific illiteracy unless we recognize the elephant in the room and deal with it. Study after study has shown that the misconceptions of students aren't changed when you just present them with facts. They will readily incorporate those facts into their distorted worldview and that's exactly what happens when we teach evolution to creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They need to be shown why their worldview is wrong and this means bringing up in class all the problems with Intelligent Design Creationism. Like it or not, that means teaching Intelligent Design Creationism in the science classroom even if the goal is to refute it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astrology is a good analogy. One way to teach critical thinking is to have a lesson on astrology where you explain what&amp;#39;s wrong with it and why it doesn&amp;#39;t work. You don&amp;#39;t ban it from the classroom because it&amp;#39;s bad science—you bring it into the classroom because it&amp;#39;s bad science and students need to hear why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don't do that, many students will continue to think that astrology is real and before you know it you've created another generation of citizens who don't understand science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing that Intelligent Design Creationists should fear the most is that we actually will confront it in the classroom and expose it for the nonsense it is. They're safe as long as we tip-toe around it. That leaves them free to teach their nonsense in Sunday school without fear of ever being contradicted.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I'm well aware of the Constitutional arguments in America. If someone like PZ wants to argue that Intelligent Design Creationism should be taught in US schools but the Constitution forbids it, then I'm prepared to agree with him. The debate I want is whether it should be taught in schools that don't have such a silly law. Should it be taught in Canadian schools? I say yes.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-1020026170551004135?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258484551219"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/what_to_do_about_ray_comforts.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f992090f879ea41c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">What to do about Ray Comfort's Origin give-away</title><published>2009-11-17T18:15:52Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T18:15:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/AWHz6NAjmDY/what_to_do_about_ray_comforts.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/what_to_do_about_ray_comforts.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Go to the NCSE's &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/"&gt;Don't Diss Darwin&lt;/a&gt; site, and download the flyers and bookmarks and information there.

&lt;p&gt;It was a strange event. &lt;a href="http://kittywhumpus.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-thought-it-went-really-well-until-he.html"&gt;Kittywhumpus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/bergman_vs_myers_debate_should.php"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; have good detailed breakdowns of the debate, so you can always read those for the audience perspective. As for me, I've learned that you can never prepare for a debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried. I had a focus — the topic, chosen by Bergman, was &amp;quot;Should Intelligent Design be taught in the schools&amp;quot; — and what I prepared for my side was a set of arguments on that point. I used my own experience teaching biology to lay down a few principles: to teach a subject as science, you need an explanatory mechanism or theory that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the data, and you need a body of evidence, real-world observations, measurements, and experiments that you incorporate as well as you can into the theory. I explained that Intelligent Design, in the estimation of scientists and by its proponents own admission, lacked both. Therefore, it didn&amp;#39;t belong in the science classroom. It is not enough for a science teacher to simply declare that &amp;quot;some people think an intelligent agent intervened at some point in the history of some species&amp;quot;, she needs specifics. She needs to be able to answer questions about how and when this intervention occurred, and how we know it. I explained that whenever IDists try to concretely define what they would teach in the classroom, it&amp;#39;s never about their theory or their evidence, because they have none, but that it&amp;#39;s always reduced to a laundry list of gripes about evolution…and I predicted that that&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;d hear from Bergman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a good argument, anyway. Too bad the other guy never addressed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I read Bergman's dreadful long book, &lt;i&gt;Slaughter of the Dissidents&lt;/i&gt;. It's entirely about how cruelly Intelligent Design creationists' careers were cut short by a reactionary establishment that unfairly silences new ideas. It's complete BS, but I prepared brief rebuttals of some of the major instances he wrote about, like the cases of Rodney LeVake and Carolyn Crocker and Guillermo Gonzalez and a few others, just in case. There was no just in case needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I've come off a couple of big science meetings, so I had at the tip of my brain several pro-science case studies, good examples of theory guiding science to produce productive information. This, also, was not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a point in the debate where I did just throw a stack of my notes over my shoulder. They were pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bergman&amp;#39;s argument was bizarre and irrational. We got a long biographical introduction in which he described bouncing about from atheism to faith to a different faith, and how nobody liked him because he was an ideological pariah (I felt like mentioning that there might be other, more personal reasons people avoid the crazy person, but that would have been cruel). He made concessions and seemed to think I was right that ID lacks a strong theory, but that that wasn&amp;#39;t important — you don&amp;#39;t need theory. He teaches medical school, and he just teaches the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two linchpins to his argument, neither of which addressed the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is that he had scientifically proven that there were no such thing as vestigial organs, therefore evolution is false. How did he do this? By redefining "vestigial" to mean "having no function at all", so all he had to do was demonstrate that it did or potentially did anything to make his case. One problem: that's not the definition. Vestigial organs are those that are greatly reduced in one species relative to a homologous organ in another species. He kept returning to the appendix, like a dog to its vomit, all night long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did a lot of quirky redefinitions throughout the evening. Apparently, everything is religion, and he seemed to be on the verge of claiming that teaching science in the science classroom was a violation of the separation of church and state. He had this bizarre case of a teacher somewhere who was fired for posting the periodic table in his classroom. The periodic table was his religion, you see. I could not make sense of what he was saying, or understand how it related to the topic of the debate, and I asked for confirmable details and mentioned that I&amp;#39;d read his book, but didn&amp;#39;t remember that story anywhere in it…to which he replied that it was in volume II, and that the book was just the first in a 5-volume series. My brain briefly whited out at that revelation, and there was a moment or two in which, if I&amp;#39;d said anything, it would have been a chain of profanities. I kept my cool, never fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, the periodic table is irreducibly complex. That's also why the administration hated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was his second key point: everything is irreducibly complex. He has this radical, dare I say &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;, version of irreducible complexity in his head in which everything except sub-atomic particles are irreducibly complex. A carbon atom, for instance, has a specific number of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and if you change those, it is no longer a carbon atom, and therefore it fits Michael Behe's definition of IC perfectly. Here's Behe's definition, if you need reminding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional. An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Bergman claims that everything is IC. Which I suppose one could support with an exceptionally naive reading of the definition, in which case Behe's argument that you need intelligent agents to create irreducibly complex systems is effectively refuted, since natural processes going on in the sun are producing irreducibly complex carbon right now. I expressed some incredulity at Bergman's use of the term, and actually, horrendously, guiltily spent a moment &lt;i&gt;defending Behe's definition&lt;/i&gt;, which made me feel so dirty inside. I need a high colonic right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it. That was his side of the debate. The only surprise left at the end was that yes, of course, &lt;a href="http://kittywhumpus.blogspot.com/2009/11/thats-your-argument-more-thoughts-on.html"&gt;Bergman puked out the "evolution leads to Hitler" argument&lt;/a&gt;, well past the time at which I could rip into that ugly lie. Talking to people afterwards, that seems to have been one of the most memorable moments, when Bergman briefly took off his cheerful loony yokel mask and revealed the ugly hater beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got a long parade of questions from both sides of the aisle (did I mention the joint was packed? It was one of the larger crowds I&amp;#39;ve had). Mark Borrello was a fabulous moderator — we didn&amp;#39;t work him too hard during the debate itself, since we both managed to hew fairly close to our allotted time slots, but he was an excellent enforcer in the Q&amp;amp;A, cutting short those long pronouncements we often get in these kinds of events. I did notice that he was practically choking himself after the Hitler bomb was dropped — as a historian of science himself, he would have been the perfect fellow to dismantle that nonsense, but then of course his neutrality as moderator would have been blown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I joined a group from &lt;a href="http://cashumn.org/"&gt;CASH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/"&gt;Minnesota Atheists&lt;/a&gt; to, I guess, celebrate. It was a total rout, I'm afraid. I have no idea what the &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/"&gt;creationists&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we left the Twin Cities after midnight for the long drive home. I can tell I'm not going to be good for much of anything today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Oh, the inevitable question: yes, it was videotaped by the creationists. They said a DVD will be available. I don't know when; somehow, I don't think they'll be in an enthusiastic rush to get this one out.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/that_bergman-myers_debate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pvUyI6rm_cs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258483336672"><id gr:original-id="788 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/298f5eeb25f09420</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/religion/creationism"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/61"/><category term="peer review" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1120"/><category term="theory" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/613"/><category term="Video" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/974"/><category term="Woo" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/woo"/><title type="html">Creationists: Put Up or Shut Up</title><published>2009-11-17T17:01:09Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T17:01:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/788" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://youtube.com/v/A6aU7zakKBs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" length="1028"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Cdk007's Youtube videos on evolution are now syndicated on layscience.net.

Most such tudies try to work out which parts of the brain are activated when people have religious thoughts. This new one looks at whether religious people have more or fewer nerve cells in different parts of their brains.It&amp;#39;s by the team lead by Jordan Grafman that published a study earlier in the year on brain activation. This latest study uses data from the same brain scans.Basically, the deal is that they boiled their subjects&amp;#39; religious beliefs down to four factors:Intimacy of relationship with God, including praying and religious participation.Religiosity of upbringingPragmatism (which covers the sorts of ideas that the non-religious would agree with)Fear of God’s angerThen they looked at the thickness of the cerebral cortex, and measured which bits were thicker (or thinner) in subjects that endorsed each of these beliefs.The idea is that the thicker bits have more neurones, which means that they work harder. If you know what those regions that have more neurones do, then you can start to figure out what religion (and non-religion) actually is, at least in terms of brain processing.The first factor, intimacy with god, was greater in people who had more neurones in an area of the brain that deals with interpersonal relationships.Now, that&amp;#39;s interesting stuff because it shows that people who have a prediliction for feeling intimate with God (praying to god, going to church) may essentially be highly social. The God thing is just an extension of that into the supernatural.The other interesting thing to ponder, according to the researchers, is that this same bit of the brain is also associated with mental disorders. People with a lot of neurones in this area are at risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and people with few neurones are at risk of schizophrenia.Here&amp;#39;s what they conclude from that:We speculate that the range of RMTG volumes can be viewed as a spectrum, in which high RMTG volume is associated with stereotyped and ritualistic behavior, high-normal volume is associated with religious behavior (which, we should note, is by definition ritualistic), low-normal volume is associated with non-religiosity, and pathologically low volume is associated with schizophrenia (in which disorganized behavior and aberrant religiosity, with blurred boundaries between the self and God, may occur).The other interesting factor was number 3 - the &amp;#39;non-religious&amp;#39; factor. This was associated with a part of the brain involved in switching to different perspectives. That suggests that people who are more able to take different perspectives may take a more skeptical, worldly attitude.Finally, factor 4, fear of god, was associated with fewer neurones in a region associated with empathy and the ability to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on in other people&amp;#39;s minds. It also helps with using memories to deal with current situations. The researchers suggest that people deficient in this region may fear god essentially because they don&amp;#39;t feel confident that they know what god is going to do next.Now, this is all correlational stuff. It doesn&amp;#39;t tell us whether people are born this way, or if these regions of the brain expand (or contract) as a result of life experiences.Factor 2, religious upbringing, hit a blank. You could take this to mean that having a religious upbringing does not change your brain in any detectable way. But it might simply be that the bits it changes are the same bits that are associated with religious beliefs.The researchers draw two overall conclusions from this. Firstly, this is more evidence that there is no special bit of the brain for &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39;. Rather, religion taps into neural pathways that evolved for other reasons:This implies that religious beliefs and behavior emerged not as sui generis evolutionary adaptations, but as an extension (some would say ‘‘by product’’) of social cognition and behavior.Secondly, the type of god a religious person believes in is a consequence of their underlying neural makeup:...the current study suggests that evolution of certain areas that advanced understanding and empathy towards our fellow human beings (such as BA 7, 11 and 21) may, at the same time, have allowed for a relationship with a perceived supernatural agent (God) based on intimacy rather than fear.In other words, it seems that the way a religious person conceives of their god is a reflection of their own ingrained personality.___________________________________________________________________Kapogiannis D, Barbey AK, Su M, Krueger F, &amp;amp; Grafman J (2009).

These mutations accumulate as a natural result of errors in DNA replication between the time that the zygote is first formed and the time that the sperm and egg cells are produced for the next generation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A species cannot afford to accumulate deleterious mutations in the genomes of its individuals. Eventually the number of "bad" mutations will reach a level where most genes have multiple "bad" alleles and it becomes impossible to produce offspring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This phenomenon is referred to as &lt;i&gt;genetic load&lt;/i&gt;. It means that species can only survive if the genetic load is below some minimum value. A good rule of thumb is that there can't be more than 0.1 deleterious mutations per individual per generation but in actual populations this value can be a bit higher. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you reconcile this with the known mutation rate in humans? If there are, on average, 130 mutations per individual per generation, then hardly any of these can be deleterious if the species is to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one of the arguments in favor of Neutral Theory. Most mutations are neither deleterious nor beneficial. They are simply neutral with respect to natural selection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's think about a typical protein-encoding gene.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The coding region is about 2,000 base pairs in length and consist of 666 codons. More than half these codons can be mutated to a new codon encoding a different amino acid without severe effects on the function of the protein.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; These are called amino acid substitutions. Of the "essential" codons, many can tolerate mutations that create synonymous codons. Putting these facts together suggests that only about 20% of mutations to protein encoding regions are detrimental. The rest are effectively neutral.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This partially explains why we can tolerate 130 mutations per individual per generation. If only 20% were detrimental then the genetic load is reduced to about 26 mutations per generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's still unacceptably high. It leads to the idea that a large percentage of our genome must be unaffected by mutations. In other words, genes represent only a small percentage of our genome and mutations can freely accumulate in the rest without detrimental consequences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to bring the genetic load down to acceptable levels, the number of genes has to be less than 40,000 according to the arguments made in the 1960s. We now know that we have only 20,000 genes. Most of them encode proteins and the coding regions of those genes make up about 40,000,000 bp or about 1.3% of our genome [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/junk-in-your-genome-protein-encoding.html"&gt;Junk in Your Genome: Protein-Encoding Genes&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recall that only 20% of mutations in coding regions are likely to be detrimental. That means that the effective target size for detrimental mutations is about 20% x 1.3% = 0.26% of our genome. Out of 130 mutations, only 0.3 per individual per generation will be detrimental.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we are diploid organisms, the 130 mutations in the zygote are spread out over two copies of our genome but almost all of them will be in the chromosomes coming from the father. Every zygote inherits one complete set of chromosomes with hardly any mutations while the other set has less than one detrimental mutation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because a large percentage of gene mutations are neutral, and because most of our genome is junk, we can easily tolerate 130 mutations per individual per generation without going extinct.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creationists will never understand this because: (a) they believe that modern evolutionary theory is all about "Darwinism" and Darwinian evolution doesn't recognize neutral mutations and random genetic drift, and (b) they can't admit to junk DNA because that's the opposite of what intelligent design would look like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Similar arguments apply to genes that make functional RNAs and not proteins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Over the course of several billion years of evolution it is unusual to see more than 30% sequence similarity between homologous genes. I realize that this is a somewhat circular argument but it's still a good one.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. There are lots of other regions of the genome where mutations can be detrimental. I don't mean to imply that only protein encoding regions can be affected by mutations. Collectively, these other regions don't make up more than a few percent of our genome and they can tolerate many mutations [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/02/theme-genomes-junk-dna.html"&gt;Genomes &amp;amp; Junk DNA&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-2898954095937178176?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258479582374"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18372">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/596fa8265fa356fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Atheist Generosity"/><category term="Churches"/><category term="Coming Out"/><category term="Education"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: An Atheist Considering Becoming An Anglican Minister</title><published>2009-11-17T17:30:37Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T17:30:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/17/ask-richard-an-atheist-considering-becoming-an-anglican-minister/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Richard,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great admirer of the eloquent yet simple advice you give on Friendly  Atheist. I have been “out” as an atheist for about one year now. I work in a Divinity Faculty, where I am surrounded by liberal, thoughtful, sophisticated religious believers, and recently I have been having thoughts about becoming an ordained minister in the Anglican Church. I feel that this job would give me personal fulfillment and allow me to do what I  really want to do in my life, which is to, well, ‘minister’ to people’s needs, to be there for them in the hard times and help them celebrate the good times. I believe that religion does not have to be about beliefs, but actions, that it can be a force for good rather than hatred, and that “God” can be useful as a symbol which can provide many different meanings and frameworks for different people. I also believe that I would perhaps be  more use to the furthering of reason and tolerance if I were within ‘the  system’, promoting religious moderation than simply being an outsider.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is: should I pursue this career path, whilst remaining an  atheist (or a ‘theological non-realist’ to give it a ‘theologically  acceptable’ term)?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate your advice on this issue, and I look forward to  hearing from you soon.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Conflicted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve expressed two goals that you would like to accomplish in your life.  One is to  “attend to the wants and needs of others, to give aid or service,” which is one of the definitions of the verb “to minister.” Most people would agree that that is a very noble and admirable desire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your other goal is to bring about positive change in the church, making it more responsive to a wider range of people’s needs, and to improve its influence on society; to in a way, humanize it. Many people would approve of that as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, your proposed method poses some ethical and pragmatic difficulties.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t clear from your letter, but I’m going to assume that if you were to apply to the ministry, you would do so openly as an atheist, just as you are now at your workplace. I’m assuming this because I think you know you wouldn’t be able to cover up your lack of belief for very long.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clerics who become free of their faith while they are ministering to their flocks. Many leave the clergy, some famously, because they cannot abide the conflict of promoting and reassuring beliefs in others that they no longer hold for themselves. They see it as hypocrisy, and it is too painful for them. An unknown number of these people continue on in their ministry as secret apostates, keeping up a deception for either selfish or noble reasons. Perhaps they just want to keep their jobs, or perhaps they want to keep on helping others somehow, “ministering” in that decent and generous meaning of the verb to which you aspire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being secretive about your atheism would pose ethical problems, and being open about your atheism would pose pragmatic problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concealing it would require lying. That by itself is an ethical breach that should not be acceptable to a person who wants to be a professional helper in any capacity. Hiding it would most likely also cause injury to others. Since people look to their ministers for ethical guidance and moral modeling as well as spiritual solace, a closet atheist minister would be running a serious risk of implanting terrible cynicism, bitterness and deep hurt in those who trust in him, once the truth eventually comes out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because eventually, it always does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open about your atheism might stop you right at the front door of the Anglican seminary or divinity school. From what I can find in a quick online search, the initial process of “discernment” involves intense and intimate examinations by your own personal priest, a discernment committee, a commission on ministry, a Bishop, and perhaps even a mental health professional. These people will assess the suitability of your intentions, personal history, values, attitudes, ideas, goals,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and your beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t believe in their god, they may see you as missing an essential prerequisite.  Your openhearted desire to help others and your open-minded desire to bring more breadth, reason and tolerance to the church from the inside may not be enough for them to trust you with either their doctrine or their flock.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you somehow get past all those barriers and become a minister, the hardest questions will come from the people whom you are trying to help.  They will look you in the eyes and say, “My little girl died today. Please tell me that she’s going to heaven.”  Will you respond with reason, or with the comforting myth they so desperately want to hear you confirm?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicted, I don’t want to extinguish your wonderful longing to be of service to others, to “be there for them in the hard times and help them celebrate the good times” as you so movingly put it, by only listing reasons why your idea may not work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps your experience in the divinity faculty and your knowledge of the Anglican Church is extensive, and you know how you could overcome those pragmatic hurdles. I’m certainly no expert on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can find ways to reconcile a person’s desire for a reassuring bedtime story with your rational mind’s demands to tell them the truth as you see it. I don’t pretend to be that wise, but I don’t assume that no one else is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps also, your broad vision of God and religion, and how you could influence the church from the inside toward embracing more reason, tolerance and moderation is somehow attainable. When people propose lofty aspirations, I never use the word “impossible” because thousands of people have personally amazed me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can point out that you have other options, other venues for helping people on a personal level.  For instance, you sound like you’d make an excellent counselor. That is a broad and varied field, and you don’t necessarily have to specialize too narrowly into one kind of need to fulfill.  It has a challenging and interesting process to qualify, just as would the ministry.  My years as a counselor were immensely fulfilling.  I made a positive difference, and I even saved a few lives. I still get great pleasure from the little bit of service I can offer with this column. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the path of the psy does not appeal to you, there are many other ways that you could find satisfaction as well as sustenance by making the world around you a little better than it was before. That is the whole point of life for people like you and me; that we somehow, even in small ways, make a positive difference in others’ lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your imagination. Your generous spirit can be of great value in so many unexpected ways.  Find them all! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may send your questions for Richard to &lt;a href="mailto:AskRichard@ca.rr.com?subject=Advice%20Needed"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/AskRichard.png" alt="AskRichard" width="128" height="16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; All questions will eventually be answered, but not all can be published.  There is a large number of requests; please be patient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This reinforces a fact that I have long emphasized–conservatives support their authors, promote them on radio (as Michael Medved did yesterday), buy their books in droves, turn them into stars. Liberals and academic scholar and scientists, in general, don’t have the same drive to win the war of ideas. This is why Bjorn Lomborg is always such a big success, for instance, while authors of pro-science climate books regularly struggle to get noticed (unless they are Al Gore with preexisting celebrity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the evolution arena, Meyer’s book is clearly drawing a lot of attention and is scarcely being refuted so far as I can see, despite containing some pretty &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/16/bad-history-of-science-from-id-proponents/"&gt;obvious travesties&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., in Meyer’s own field, the history of science). So perhaps I had better dive in, as I did on the air yesterday, and describe some problems with Meyer’s arguments and approach. Alas, it is pretty hard to directly refute someone who looks at the currently unsolved question of the origins of life, throws up his hands, and says, it’s so improbable, God must have done it. That’s just not in the scientific spirit. Still, perhaps it is time to take on Meyer’s misinformation, as it is obviously starting to have significant influence…..&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps not what you think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/d/215298-2/phot-43a-09-fullres.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/v445puppis.jpg" alt="v445puppis" title="v445puppis" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-43-09.html"&gt;This series of images&lt;/a&gt; [as usual, click to embiggen], from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, will take some ’splainin. Hang on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supernova — an exploding star — is among the brightest single objects in the known Universe. A supernova can release as much energy in a single second as the Sun will in a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people think of supernovae as massive stars exploding at the end of their lives, but there is another kind. When the Sun finally dies in a few billion more years, it will shed most of the material making up its outer layers, revealing the white-hot, dense core. This superhot ball will have half the mass of the Sun in it, but only be the size of the Earth. We call such a thing a white dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a white dwarf orbits a normal star like the Sun, it can draw material off. This matter piles up on the surface and can eventually detonate like a stellar thermonuclear bomb. We call these Type Ia supernovae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, massive stars are bright, so we can see them a long way off.  We know of many stars in our galaxy that can blow that way (though all too far away to hurt us). But a Type Ia progenitor is faint, and hard to spot. Usually, the first notice we get of one is when it explodes, and we see the sudden and vast increase in light in a distant galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But astronomers have spotted a potential Type Ia supernova in our own galaxy, a ticking time bomb about 25,000 light years away. Called V445 Puppis, in November 2000 it underwent an explosive event: not a supernova, but a regular nova, the detonation of small (in cosmic terms) amount of material. Still, &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.1069"&gt;it ejected a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of matter&lt;/a&gt; — several times the mass of the entire Earth — at very &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; speed, about &lt;strong&gt;24 million kilometers per hour&lt;/strong&gt; (14 million mph). That would reach from the Earth to the Moon &lt;em&gt;in one minute flat&lt;/em&gt;. Over the course of several years, astronomers have taken images of the expanding debris, and the change — seen in the picture above — is dramatic, lovely, and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debris did not expand spherically because the two stars are in a tight orbit, circling each other rapidly. The matter drawn off the normal star forms a thick disk around the white dwarf. When the material on the surface exploded, it couldn’t go through the disk, so it went up and down, above and below the disk. Over time it forms what’s called a bipolar structure, because it comes out of the poles of the star. We see lots of similar bipolar objects, but not usually in a system that’s about to go bye-bye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, there is no detectable hydrogen in the system. The surface of the white dwarf appears to be mostly helium, and the normal star looks to be dumping only helium on the white dwarf. Type Ia supernovae are hydrogen poor, even lacking it completely, so that fits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the mass of the white dwarf in V445 Puppis is on the thin hairy edge of the maximum it can be before it blows. When a white dwarf reaches 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, it goes kablooie (I had to calculate this as a homework problem in grad school). V445’s mass? 1.35 times that of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when will the system go off? Hard to say. It may not be for thousands of years, or even longer. At that distance, it will be very bright in the sky, brighter than Venus. It won’t hurt us; it’s way too far away to to do that. But a nearby supernova of this type would be a huge boon to astronomy! It’s this flavor of supernova we use to measure the expansion of the Universe (since they are so bright they can be seen very far away, and tend to blow up with the same brightness every time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little funny to think that the death of a star so many quadrillions of kilometers away can actually be a benefit to us. But remember, the calcium in our bones and iron in our blood came from supernovae like the one V445 Puppis will eventually become, so not only do we learn more about the Universe from them, we owe our very existence to them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am a High School student in Alaska. For years, I have stood up, but not recited the pledge. My reasons being some quite similar to Will Phillips’. When asked why I don’t recite the pledge, I tell them. I’ve always stood during the pledge, just because &lt;strong&gt;that’s what I was raised to do&lt;/strong&gt;. Never once did I consider sitting down for the pledge, and never once did I consider the fact that people who couldn’t see my mouth still saw me reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that will be the last time. This kid has inspired me to join the group and be the first that I’ve seen at my High School (and even in all of my years of schooling) to refuse to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance. I’ve researched, and have cited a few Alaska State Statutes in a notebook, to reference to in case that I am confronted by a teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  I think my eyes popped out a bit when I first read that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious to learn more, so I sent an email to the commenter to find out if he actually followed through with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Royston&lt;/strong&gt; of Wasilla, Alaska (yep — &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Wasilla) did what he said he would do: He didn’t stand up for the Pledge.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pushback from the administration at his school was swift and harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel wrote me the following email.  It’s lengthy but I urge you to read it.  It’s a prime example of a principal not knowing the law and a student who does.  Daniel’s not the first atheist who has to deal with this problem and he (sadly) won’t be the last.  Daniel’s own emphasis is in bold.  I’ve emphasized one bit myself with a yellow highlighter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thursday was the first day that I decided not to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. That first day, no one noticed. I figured that was okay; as long as no one said anything, I wouldn’t have any trouble with my decision.  On the second day, however, the teacher for that class told me after the Pledge that I had to at least stand. When I went to talk to her about it (respectfully), before I had a chance to say anything, she told me to go down and talk to my principal, because that’s what he told her to tell students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title14/Chapter03/Section130.htm"&gt;Alaska Statute 14.03.130&lt;/a&gt; states the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(a) United States and Alaska flags shall be displayed upon or near each principal school building during school hours and at other times the governing body considers proper. The governing body shall require that the pledge of allegiance be recited regularly, as determined by the governing body. A person may recite the following salute to the flag of the United States or maintain a respectful silence: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) &lt;strong&gt;A school district shall inform all affected persons at the school of their right not to participate in the pledge of allegiance&lt;/strong&gt;. The exercise of the right not to participate in the pledge of allegiance may not be used to evaluate a student or employee or for any other purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now clearly, that’s not what had been going on. Students were being told that they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to participate by “at least standing.”  I took my teacher up on her request and talked to my principal in his office. When I started to explain what had happened, he cut me off.  He started to lecture me about my decision. He said that we didn’t need to talk about what “our right is,” but rather “what is right.” He said that standing for the Pledge showed respect to this country and the people that have died for our freedom. I told the principal that I was expressing my “freedom” by choosing not to stand. I told him that I did not want to be associated with the Pledge of Allegiance and standing was associating myself with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal then asked if I had talked to my parents about it. I told him that, yes, I had informed my mom (the parent I live with) that I had made this decision. He then called my mom, and put her on speakerphone. Before the call, I asked him to make sure to tell my mom that I’m not in trouble, and that I came to his office voluntarily. He did no such thing. The principal started talking to my mom like I was called down to his office, and that I was in trouble. He didn’t say those things, but the school district has a code they follow when calling parents because of disciplinary problems, and he was following it word-by-word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conversation, my mom stated that it was her opinion that I should stand for the Pledge. The principal used that to say that, because my mother told me to (which she did not), I have to stand. I told him that this violated my beliefs, both political and religious, and he just cut me off to say that my mom told me to, so I have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most shocking parts of the conversation was when he started talking about me. Specifically and personally, me. He said that he’s seen a lot of kids with a lot of talent, and that I was one of them. He said that he really didn’t want to see me go down a path where I use my skills for unproductive reasons, and that he wanted to see me make it through high school. &lt;span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ffff00"&gt;I asked if my beliefs would restrict me from graduating. He then said, “Well, I don’t know. It’s possible.”&lt;/span&gt; I told him that I had formed my beliefs, and that I found standing for the Pledge of Allegiance to be offensive. He asked if my beliefs really found standing for the Pledge offensive. When I replied “yes,” he, without pause, said, “I don’t buy that.” He just said that he didn’t think I really had those beliefs. I kid you not, that’s what he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on, trying to persuade me that having the beliefs I have could bring me down at this school, that having these beliefs were wrong. When he said, “I really want to see you use the skills and intelligence that you have for good.” I said “And I am,” to which he replied, “Don’t argue with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded the meeting stating that because my mom told me to stand (again, she didn’t), I had to stand. When I asked “So, if I have my mom sign a note saying that I’m authorized to exercise my freedom of speech and of religion, then I can exercise my right to not participate?” He then said “We follow board policy” and sent me out of his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that my parents do have the right to make me stand, because I am, by law, a minor. However, I don’t think that that is the decision my parents will make. Although they don’t agree with my beliefs most of the time, they at least respect my views to a degree. The principal, however, did not respect my views even the slightest bit. I will be talked to and lectured by both parties, but my views stay, and I will not back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you give me any advice to deal with the school district on this incident? If my parents sign that childish note saying that yes, I can exercise my rights, I am more than willing to elevate this. I don’t know how far I’ll have to go to simply be able to express my right to not participate in the Pledge of Allegiance, the biggest, most blatant violation of the Separation of church and state in America today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That any principal could say what this one did is appalling.  He doesn’t know what he’s talking about and he’s trying to scare Daniel into thinking he does.  If he makes Daniel serve a detention, or any punishment, for not standing for the Pledge, this will come back to bite him in the ass.  I encourage Daniel to keep doing what he’s doing and take the licks for now.  It’ll just make for a stronger case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have passed Daniel’s letter along to a few friends who can help with this issue.  Normally, these things are taken care of with a strongly worded letter and no lawsuit has to be filed.  I would hope the principal just takes care of this matter by apologizing for what he’s said and done, and then sending faculty members an email stating (as a reminder) that students do not have to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel provided me with contact information for his teacher, the principal, and the school.  I’m not posting them here right now.  But that information is available in case it’s needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I told Daniel to talk to his mother and get this straightened out with her.  It’s important that she understand what he’s doing and why he’s doing it.  Even if she doesn’t agree with his decision, nothing that transpires should come as a surprise to her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m amazed by the courage a student like Daniel has.  Not standing for the Pledge, when everyone else around you is doing it, is an incredibly hard thing to do at that age.  But he’s teaching other students a lesson in not straying from your convictions.  I’m impressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any words of advice or encouragement for Daniel, please leave them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep you all updated as to what happens with all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Daniel spoke to his parents and they have told him they don’t want him to sit during the Pledge.  He tells me he is going to respect their wishes — and I understand that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Then Jake Townhead commented on &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; posting, questioning my use of the word &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt; and suggesting that Anderson's comment was merely "bespoke mischief". So now some words on &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, a note on why I decided DGA's comment wasn't spam. Anderson appears to be a graduate student in Cultural Studies at George Mason University (in Virginia). He has a &lt;a href="http://for-the-turnstiles.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;For the Turnstiles … on critical theory and integral theory&amp;quot;, and there&amp;#39;s a recent interview with him (&amp;quot;Nonviolence of Nonmetaphysics&amp;quot;) &lt;a href="http://www.integralworld.net/anderson1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and mentions of him and his work on a number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, this could all be an elaborate fiction, an invented persona and backstory, but at some point you have to trust some of the things you read. Another possibility is that someone has appropriated his name, e-mail address, and blog link; I've written him to check that he was in fact the source of the &lt;em&gt;go rogue&lt;/em&gt; comment. Later: he has now written back to say that he was the author but that he&amp;#39;s learned he was the victim of a prank. He apologizes for repeating misinformation, and asks that his comment be deleted — but that wouldn&amp;#39;t really help much, now that I&amp;#39;ve posted about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that I'm closing my books on sexual &lt;em&gt;go rogue&lt;/em&gt;. I started out dubious, but now I'm convinced that it's a sheer invention. DGA is not an invention, but this story about &lt;em&gt;go rogue&lt;/em&gt; is. Alas, the story seems to have spread, in the way that amazing stories do — probably because it digs at Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;. There's an &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt; draft entry of 2001 for &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt; as a verb: transitive 'to flood (a network, esp. the Internet, a newsgroup, or individuals) with a large number of unsolicited postings, or multiple copies of the same posting', intransitive 'to send large numbers of unsolicited messages or advertisements'. The first cite is from 1991, but that's from the &lt;em&gt;New Hacker's Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, so the word (in a non-food sense) goes back before 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED has, at the moment, no entry for a noun &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;, but that's also been around for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Added 11/18: Actually, it does have a sub-entry (a draft addition of 2001) for the computing noun &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;, but it's under the main entry for &lt;em&gt;Spam&lt;/em&gt; (the food name), where I didn't think to look. See discussion by Alex Boulton and me in the comments on this posting.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s been around as a mass noun (&amp;quot;how much spam?&amp;quot;) and a count noun as well, meaning &amp;#39;spam message, piece of spam&amp;#39; — a count noun that can have an ordinary s-plural (&amp;quot;how many spams?&amp;quot;) or a zero plural (&amp;quot;how many spam?&amp;quot;). By 2001, when I discussed the noun in section 10 of &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/CountingChad.pdf"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, all three of these uses were attested, and some people were using two or all three of the variants, sometimes in the same text, while other people had very strong preferences for one of the variants (I myself strongly prefer the mass variant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Entertaining fact: the spam filter that WordPress uses — on both Language Log and my blog — used to announce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akismet has caught N spam for you since you first installed it. [with the zero-plural count variant]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but at some point it shifted to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akismet has protected your site from N spam comments already … [with the noun as the first element in a noun-noun compound, a position where the count/mass distinction is normally neutralized]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The count of spam comments on Language Log is over 160,000 at the moment. Oi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what counts as a spam comment? A bulk mailing of a comment, for sure. Your classic spam comment has no real content — instead, it has nothing that relates to the posting it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;commenting&amp;quot; on (&amp;quot;Great blog!&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;How can I subscribe to this blog?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;This simply prodigy!&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Can you explain your point?&amp;quot;; a URI or list of URIs; a quotation from some random work; an advertisement for some product; etc.). The point of such comments is to send the unwary reader to a commercial URI or to jack up the sender&amp;#39;s hit count (or, of course, both). Others, in particular those that are all random gibberish, seem to be just malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spammers have gotten cleverer over the years, as I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1438"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; a while back. Comments now often seem to be tailored to some degree to the posting they're commenting on: comments linking to porn sites attached to postings with sexual content, for instance, or comments purporting to come from people the blog has mentioned, but linking to a commercial site. Some actually refer to the content of the posting ("That is an old cartoon" is a recent one on my blog, following up on a posting with a cartoon in it), but then it turns out that the URI provided is a commercial one, concerned with this content in some way (with the subject of the old cartoon, in this recent case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly difficult for bloggers to decide whether they&amp;#39;re dealing with bulk mailings (with the targets selected by software crafted for the purpose) or with hand-crafted comments designed to send the reader to a URI or just to make mischief. As a result, many people — clearly, I am one — have extended the word &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt; to cover a variety of annoying, mischievous, or malicious postings and comments that might not have been mailed in bulk. Marking such postings and comments as spam for the purposes of a spam filter is then a useful step, since the malefactors are likely to repeat their offense, and one of the things spam filters are sensitive to is the sender's address. This isn't dangerous. In WordPress, the Akismet filter doesn't automatically delete things that appear in the spam queue, but merely offers them up for moderation, so misclassifications (in either direction) can be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258475234214"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/you_know_whats_wrong_with_amer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b913e81dd2cb82f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">You know what's wrong with America?</title><published>2009-11-17T15:31:15Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T15:31:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/DHCCVTK4S5E/you_know_whats_wrong_with_amer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/you_know_whats_wrong_with_amer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our problem is that we &lt;b&gt;men&lt;/b&gt; don't &lt;b&gt;stand up&lt;/b&gt; when we &lt;b&gt;pee&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/4106706425/sizes/l/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/bernhardchrist_issmoon.jpg" alt="bernhardchrist_issmoon" title="bernhardchrist_issmoon" width="610" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the International Space Station crossing the face of the Moon, what astronomers call a &lt;em&gt;transit&lt;/em&gt; (like an eclipse, but when something small goes in front of something big). This image is actually a composite of several images taken in a row, with some sharpening to make it cleaner looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transit only lasted for 0.4 seconds, so Christ had to be on the ball to capture this. He used a digital astronomical camera that can take what is essentially video (really just rapid still shots, but after all that’s what video is), and processed the individual frames. It’s a gorgeous image, with the Moon looking really stunning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re wondering why he only got four shots of the ISS, look again: there is a shot of it just inside the limb of the Moon, but it’s low contrast and hard to see. Just follow the path of the ISS as it crosses the Moon and you’ll find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thanks to Herr Doktor Christ for allowing me to post this picture.

Figures from Google Trends show that search volume for &amp;#39;date rape drugs&amp;#39; or more specific terms like &amp;#39;Rohypnol&amp;#39; has decreased since 2004, but remains high. Up and down the country, many people are convinced they have been a victim of date rape drugs, their fears fuelled by media scare stories and alarming reports from the usually sensible ACMD.

&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;

So it&amp;#39;s all the more surprising to hear the Chief Executive of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust - a charity aimed at reducing crime - quoted in a research paper [1] making the following complaint:

&amp;quot;As far as I am aware, there has never been a case of Rohypnol in this country found ever. We ask women when they are out to look after themselves and they say  ‘I always put my finger over the bottle so it can’t be spiked’ . I want to tear my hair out because what is in the bottle is what’s lethal!&amp;quot;

To suggest that there have been no cases is perhaps an exaggeration, but the various studies we have on this tell a very different story from that reported in the press until recently.

Michael Scott-Ham of the UK&amp;#39;s Forensic Science Service led a study that &amp;quot;analysed samples taken from 1014 victims in the UK soon after the alleged assault between January 2000 and December 2002.&amp;quot; They found sedatives in only 2% of samples (the presence of which could of course have several explanations. An Australian study at two hospitals in Perth found that none of the 97 young men and women who claimed to have had their drinks spiked had been drugged. 

So if date rate drugs didn&amp;#39;t cause these people to lose control of the situation, what was it? The UK Forensic Science Service study provides a big clue. Of the 391 victims who had given samples with 12 hours of the alleged assault, around a third had consumed enough alcohol to result in unconsciousness or memory loss. Similar results have come from Northern Ireland.

To put it another way, scientific studies show that the #1 date rape drug, by far, is alcohol. 

A recent study in the British Journal of Criminology - Understanding Heightened Risk Perception of Drink ‘Spiking’ by Adam Burgess, Pamela Donovan and Sarah Moore, takes an interesting look at risk perceptions and psychology surrounding date rape drugs, conducting various surveys of students in Britain and the United States [1].

Their results highlighted the disproportionate level of risk attached to spiking:

&amp;quot;To better establish the strength of concern about DFSA, the UK respondents were asked to rate their sense of risk and sense of worry for the following four crimes: being a victim of drink-driving, being mugged, having a home or room burgled, and being a victim of DFSA (see Table 1 ). UK respondents were more likely to express acute worry about DFSA than any of the other crimes they were asked about.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Having a drink spiked with drugs was the most commonly cited risk factor for sexual assault, with 150 (75 per cent) of participants identifying this as an important risk factor — a more signi? cant risk factor than drinking alcohol or taking drugs (see  Table 2 ). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that [spiking] elicited a more acute sense of worry amongst female students than mugging.&amp;quot;

So in spite of the vanishingly small probability of drink spiking ever happening, students were more concerned about it than mugging, or drink driving. What is the explanation for this skewed perception of risk?

The elephant in the bedsit here is alcohol, a drug which culturally we seem to be in a state of denial over. Part of the explanation may be that the myth of drink-spiking provides a useful narrative through which we can rationalize away our own guilt: &amp;quot;I was in control of my drinking, but then somebody spiked my drink.&amp;quot; 

Is that true, or is it all a bit more complicated than that? How does this relate to the ongoing saga over drug policy? And how does this relate to the alternative medicine meme that &amp;#39;natural is best&amp;#39;? We&amp;#39;ll take a look in Part II of this post, which I&amp;#39;ll be putting up this evening.

&lt;p&gt; Haskell is a strongly typed language. In fact, the type system in Haskell
is both stricter and more expressive than any type system I've seen for any
non-functional language. The moment we get beyond writing trivial
integer-based functions, the type system inevitably becomes visible, so we
need to take the time now to talk about it a little bit, in order to
understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/11/types_in_haskell_types_are_pro.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/11/types_in_haskell_types_are_pro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/rkeIjZFq1mQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258470266281"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=21851">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/352e8a0288699666</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="geoengineering"/><title type="html">Hugo Chavez, Rainmaker?</title><published>2009-11-17T14:46:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T14:46:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/3IwQXH3AeDo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/hugo-chavez-rainmaker/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">SuperFreakonomics briefly considers the possibility of a rogue leader like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez deciding to unilaterally try geoengineering the planet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see you or Chris tackle this question – is media coverage where the science is inaccurate better than no media coverage? I fear that inflated claims like the ones in &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/"&gt;the NYT article&lt;/a&gt; may cause the public to discount the whole issue, once they find out that some of the facts are exaggerated or false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The short answer is, of course, &lt;em&gt;it depends&lt;/em&gt;. More science coverage is critically necessary if we’re to foster broader public understanding, acceptance, and appreciation of science, BUT hyperbole and inaccurate stories frequently undermine good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Before diving in, I’d like to hear from readers… Is inaccurate media coverage of science better than no coverage at all?&lt;/p&gt;

But the new data from Pew are pretty stark: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/10/only-six-percent-of-scien_n_229382.html"&gt;Only 6 percent&lt;/a&gt; of scientists describe themselves as Republican. 55 percent describe themselves as Democrats, and 32 percent as independents; which means that scientists skew Dem by a considerable margin when compared to the general population (which claims to be 23 percent GOP, 35 percent DEM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these figures are unsurprising and even justifiable, in that so much anti-science comes from Republicans. I had to deal with one &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/16/an-id-proponent-denies-global-warming/"&gt;just last night&lt;/a&gt; who was attacking both climate science and evolutionary science. And of course, it is not just that Republicans are often anti-science, but that they are often driven by religious motivations to be so. Scientists, by contrast, are a very, very strongly secular group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever else you may say about these figures, it is unfortunate that they play directly into the culture war. If conservative pundits want to wrongly dismiss science as a liberal atheist plot, I guess I know what they’ll be citing….&lt;/p&gt;

But on the basis of her description, it seems to me that one of his claims is not quite right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;According to Lynch, the very notion of correct English is only 300 years old; in the days of Chaucer and Shakespeare, the idea that native English speakers could be accused of using their own language improperly would have seemed absurd. The advent of printing — and, especially, the growth of general literacy — led to efforts to establish authoritative standards of spelling and usage in the 18th century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's certainly true that Tudor and Elizabethan spelling was catch-as-catch-can, and it's also true that prescriptive rules of usage blossomed in the 18th century, along with the standardization of spelling. But it's not true that native speakers in Shakespeare's time never accused one another of using their own language improperly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.As evidence, and because it's fun to read, I'll post again a few paragraphs of Thomas Nash's "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MNAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;pg=RA1-http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MNAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;vq=reprehenders&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PR2#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Epistle to the Reader&lt;/a&gt;", apparently published as an introduction to the 1594 second edition of &lt;em&gt;Christ's Tears over Jerusalem,:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The ploddinger sort of unlearned Zoilists about London exclaim that it is a puft-up stile, and full of prophane eloquence: others object unto me the multitude of my boystrous compound wordes, and the often coyning of Italionate verbes, which end all in &lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;mummianize, tympanize, tirannize&lt;/em&gt;. To the first array of my clumperton antagonists this I answer — that my stile is no otherwise puft up, then any mans should be which writes with any spirite; and whom would not such a devine subject put a high ravishte spirite into? For the prophaneness of my eloquence, so they may terme the eloquence of Sainct Austin, Jerome, Chrysostome, prophane, since none of them but takes unto him faire more liberty of tropes, figures, and metaphors, and alleadging heathen examples and histories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To the second rancke of reprehenders, that complain of my boystrous compound wordes, and ending my Italionate coyned verbes all in &lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt;, thus I reply: that no winde that blowes strong but is boystrous, no speech or wordes, or any power of force to confute or persuade, but must be swelling and boystrous. For the compounding of my wordes, therein I imitate rich men, who, having gathered store of white single money together, convert a number of those small little scutes into great peeces of gold, such as double pistols and Portugues. Our English tongue, of all languages, most swarmeth with the single money of monasillables, which are the onely scandal of it. Bookes written in them, and no other, seeme like shop-keepers boxes, that contain nothing else save halfe-pence, three farthings and two-pences. Therefore, what did me I, but having a huge heape of those worthlesse shreds of small English in my &lt;em&gt;pia mater&lt;/em&gt;'s purse, had them to the compounders immediately, and exchanged them foure into one, and others into more, according to the Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Come, my maisters, enure your mouths to it, and never trust me, but when you have tride the commodity of carrying much in a small roome, you will, like the apothecaries, use more compounds than simples, and graft wordes as men do their trees, to make them more fruitfull. My upbraided Italionate verbes are the least crime of a thousand, since they are growne in generall request with every good poet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Besides, they carrie farre more state with them then any other, and are not halfe so harsh in their desinence as the old hobling English verbes ending in r: they express more than any other verbes whatsoever, and that substantives would be quite barraine of verbs, but for that ending. This word &lt;em&gt;mummianized&lt;/em&gt;, in the beginning of my first Epistle, is shrewdly called into question, for no other reason, that I can conceive, but that his true derivative, which is &lt;em&gt;mummy&lt;/em&gt;, is somewhat obscure also: to phisitions and their confectioners it is as familiar as &lt;em&gt;mumchance&lt;/em&gt; among pages, being nothing else but mans flesh long buried and broyled in the burning sands of Arabia. Hereupon I have taken up this phrase of Jerusalems &lt;em&gt;mummianized&lt;/em&gt; earth manured with mans flesh. Express who can the same substance so briefly in any other word but that. A man may murder any thing if hee list in the mouthing, and grinde it to powder extempore betwixt a huge paire of jawes, but let a quest of calme censors goe upon it betwixt the houres of sixe and seaven in the morning, and they will, in their grave wisdome, subscribe to it as tollerable and significant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I posted this passage before, in "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1241"&gt;Centuries of disgust and horror?&lt;/a&gt;" (3/16/2009), I noted that  the OED atributes the &lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt; phrase to a work published in 1591:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1591&lt;/strong&gt; NASHE &lt;em&gt;Introd. Sidney&amp;#39;s Astr. &amp;amp; Stella &lt;/em&gt;in P. Penilesse (Shaks. Soc.) p. xxx, Reprehenders, that complain of my boystrous compound wordes, and ending my Italionate coyned verbes all in ize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in commenting on a &lt;a href="http://www.bisso.com/epea/2008/05/ize-write.html"&gt;post at at Epea Pteroenta&lt;/a&gt;, Conrad Roth confirms that the 1594 citation is the correct one, and also quote this passage from his master's thesis, which indicates that Nash took both sides of the argument over neologistic "huge woords":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As his use of language developed in later works, Nashe began to defend his own inkhornism in terms of persuasive rhetoric. In the preface to Christs Teares over Ierusalem, he argues in favour of 'boystrous compound wordes' that 'no speech or wordes of any power or force to confute or perswade but must bee swelling and boystrous' (2/184). Rather than censuring the 'mechanicall mate', who 'abhorreth the English he was borne too' (3/311), he now advocates the compounding of monosyllables, after the manner of the 'Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian' (2/184), comparing this neologistic technique to the grafting of trees 'to make them more fruitful'. When, having explained the word 'Mummianize', he issues a challenge to 'Expresse who can the same substance so briefly in any other word but that' (2/185), Nashe is using one of the chief justifications given by mid-century neologisers. The appeal to rhetoric continues in the preface to Lenten Stuffe, in which Nashe justifies his use of 'huge woords' with the claim that he has become a 'tragicus Orator' (3/152): the very species he had lampooned in the Preface to Menaphon ten years earlier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth quoting &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-admin/id=pGwVAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;the earlier Nashe&lt;/a&gt; at greater length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is grown of late; so that euery mechanicall mate abhorreth the English he was borne too, and plucks, with a solemne periphrasis, his &lt;em&gt;vt vales&lt;/em&gt; from the inkehorne: which I impute, not so much to the perfection of Arts, as to the seruile imitation of vaine glorious Tragedians, who contend not so seriously to excell in action, as to embowell the cloudes in a speech of comparison, thinking themselues more than initiated in Poets immortality, if they but once get &lt;em&gt;Boreas&lt;/em&gt; by the beard and the heauenly Bull by the deaw-lap. But heerein I cannot so fully bequeath them to folly, as their ideot Art-masters, that intrude themselues to our eares as the Alcumists of eloquence, who (mounted on the stage of arrogance) thinke to out-braue better pennes with the swelling bombast of bragging blanke verse. Indeede it may bee the ingrafted ouerflow of some kil-cow conceit, that ouercloyeth their imagination with a more then drunken resolution, being not extemporall in the inuention of any other meanes to vent their manhoode, commits the digestion of their cholericke incumbrances to the spacious volubilitie of a drumming decasillabon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we should quote one of the OED's examples for &lt;em&gt;ink-horn term&lt;/em&gt; "a term of the literary language, a learned or bookish word":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1589&lt;/strong&gt; PUTTENHAM &lt;em&gt;Eng. Poesie&lt;/em&gt; II. xii[i]. (Arb.) 130 Irreuocable, irradiation, depopulation and such like,..which..were long time despised for inkehorne termes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I note in passing that someone who writes  "the spacious volubilitie of a drumming decasillabon" can never have been a fully sincere opponent of the ink-horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But leaving Mr. Nashe behind, we turn to the source of the OED's earliest citation for &lt;em&gt;ink-horn term&lt;/em&gt;, namely &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ThEJAAAAQAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Arte of English Poesie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, apparently published in 1589 (though perhaps written several decades earlier).  It's less entertaining than Nashe, but if anything even more peevish, e.g. &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ThEJAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=%22arte%20of%20english%20poesie%22&amp;amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=inkehorne&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Now also wheras I said before that our old Saxon English for his many &lt;em&gt;monosillables&lt;/em&gt; did not naturally admit the vse of the ancient feete in our vulgar measures so aptly as in those languages which stood most vpon &lt;em&gt;polisillables&lt;/em&gt;, I sayd it in a sort truly, but now I must recant and confesse that our Normane English which hath growen since &lt;em&gt;William&lt;/em&gt; the Conquerour doth admit any of the auncient feete, by reason of the many &lt;em&gt;polysillables&lt;/em&gt; eeuen to sixe and seauen in one word, which we at this day vse in our most ordinarie language: and which corruption hath been hath been occasioned chiefly by the peeuish affectation not of the Normans them selues, but of clerks and scholers or secretaries long since, who not content with the vsual Normane or Saxon word, would conuert the very Latine and Greeke word into vulgar French as to say innumerable for innombrable, reuocable, irreuocable, irradiation, depopulation and such like, which are not naturall Normans nor yet French, but altered Latines, and without any imitation at all: which therefore were long time despised for inkehorne terms, and now be reputed the best and most delicat of any other. Of which and many other causes of corruption of our speach we haue in another place more amply discoursed …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other passages  in this work that could pass for  20th-century prescriptivism,  if translated into a more modern idiom. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;.. after a speach is fully fashioned to the common understanding, and accepted by consent of a whole countrey and nation, it is called a language, and receaueth none allowed alternation, but by extraordinary occasions by little and litle, as it were insensibly bringing in of many corruptions that creepe along with the time; of all which matters, we haue more largely spoken in our bookes of the originals and pedigree of the English tong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[W]e finde in our English writers many wordes and speaches amendable, and ye shall see in some many inkhorne terms so ill affected brought in by men of learning as preachers and schoolemasters: and many straunge terms of other languages by Secretaries and Marchaunts and trauailours, and many darke wordes and not vusall nor well sounding, though they be dayly spoken in Court. Wherefore great heed must be taken by our maker in this point that his choise be good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note how "Secretaries" are persistently blamed for corruption of the language, anticipating the more recent &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1780"&gt;peeving about manager-speak&lt;/a&gt;. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[M]any other like words borrowed out of the Latin and French, were not so well to be allowed by us, as these words, &lt;em&gt;audacious&lt;/em&gt;, for bold: &lt;em&gt;facuditie&lt;/em&gt;, for eloquence: &lt;em&gt;egregious&lt;/em&gt;, for great or notable: &lt;em&gt;implete&lt;/em&gt;, for replenished: &lt;em&gt;attemptat&lt;/em&gt;, for attempt: &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;, for agreeable in nature, and many more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Your next intollerable vice is&lt;em&gt; solecismus&lt;/em&gt; or incongruitie, as when we speake false English, that is by misusing the &lt;em&gt;Grammaticall&lt;/em&gt; rules to be observed in cases, genders, tenses and such like, euery poore scholler knowes the fault, and cals it the breaking of &lt;em&gt;Priscians&lt;/em&gt; head, for he was among the Latines a principall Grammarian. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Another of your intollerable vices is ill disposition or placing of your words in a clause or sentence […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;All these remembred faults be intollerable and euer vndecent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's clear that English-language prescriptivism was well established in the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258468048144"><id gr:original-id="787 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96e1f40ca3036ef6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Drink Spiking Myth Part 1</title><published>2009-11-17T12:26:12Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T12:26:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/787" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Searching the archives of the BBC, Daily Mail or Guardian returns hundreds of results for date rape drugs, such as Rohypnol. Figures from Google Trends show that search volume for 'date rape drugs' or more specific terms like 'Rohypnol' has decreased since 2004, but remains high. Up and down the country, many people are convinced they have been a victim of date rape drugs, their fears fuelled by media scare stories and &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-446203/Date-rape-report-warns-women-to-pubs-parties-alone.html"&gt;alarming reports from the usually sensible ACMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/rotrend.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's all the more surprising to hear the Chief Executive of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust - a charity aimed at reducing crime - quoted in a research paper &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt; making the following complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as I am aware, there has never been a case of Rohypnol in this country found ever. We ask women when they are out to look after themselves and they say  ‘I always put my finger over the bottle so it can’t be spiked’ . I want to tear my hair out because what is in the bottle is what’s lethal!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To suggest that there have been no cases is perhaps an exaggeration, but the various studies we have on this tell a very different story from that reported in the press until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Scott-Ham of the UK's Forensic Science Service &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925334.400"&gt;led a study&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;"analysed samples taken from 1014 victims in the UK soon after the alleged assault between January 2000 and December 2002."&lt;/em&gt; They found sedatives in only 2% of samples (the presence of which could of course have several explanations. An &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/drink-spiking-claims-rejected/story-0-1225736032435"&gt;Australian study at two hospitals in Perth&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of the 97 young men and women who claimed to have had their drinks spiked had been drugged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if date rate drugs didn't cause these people to lose control of the situation, what was it? The UK Forensic Science Service study provides a big clue. Of the 391 victims who had given samples with 12 hours of the alleged assault, around a third had consumed enough alcohol to result in unconsciousness or memory loss. Similar results have come from &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85513.php"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, scientific studies show that the #1 date rape drug, by far, is alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the British Journal of Criminology - &lt;em&gt;Understanding Heightened Risk Perception of Drink ‘Spiking’&lt;/em&gt; by Adam Burgess, Pamela Donovan and Sarah Moore, takes an interesting look at risk perceptions and psychology surrounding date rape drugs, conducting various surveys of students in Britain and the United States &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results highlighted the disproportionate level of risk attached to spiking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To better establish the strength of concern about DFSA, the UK respondents were asked to rate their sense of risk and sense of worry for the following four crimes: being a victim of drink-driving, being mugged, having a home or room burgled, and being a victim of DFSA (see Table 1 ). UK respondents were more likely to express acute worry about DFSA than any of the other crimes they were asked about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a drink spiked with drugs was the most commonly cited risk factor for sexual assault, with 150 (75 per cent) of participants identifying this as an important risk factor — a more signi? cant risk factor than drinking alcohol or taking drugs (see  Table 2 ). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that [spiking] elicited a more acute sense of worry amongst female students than mugging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in spite of the vanishingly small probability of drink spiking ever happening, students were more concerned about it than mugging, or drink driving. What is the explanation for this skewed perception of risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the bedsit here is alcohol, a drug which culturally we seem to be in a state of denial over. Part of the explanation may be that the myth of drink-spiking provides a useful narrative through which we can rationalize away our own guilt: &lt;em&gt;"I was in control of my drinking, but then somebody spiked my drink."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that true, or is it all a bit more complicated than that? How does this relate to the ongoing saga over drug policy? And how does this relate to the alternative medicine meme that 'natural is best'? We'll take a look in Part II of this post, which I'll be putting up this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

Figures from Google Trends show that search volume for 'date rape drugs' or more specific terms like 'Rohypnol' has decreased since 2004, but remains high. Up and down the country, many people are convinced they have been a victim of date rape drugs, their fears fuelled by media scare stories and &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-446203/Date-rape-report-warns-women-to-pubs-parties-alone.html"&gt;alarming reports from the usually sensible ACMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/rotrend.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's all the more surprising to hear the Chief Executive of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust - a charity aimed at reducing crime - quoted in a research paper &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt; making the following complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as I am aware, there has never been a case of Rohypnol in this country found ever. We ask women when they are out to look after themselves and they say  ‘I always put my finger over the bottle so it can’t be spiked’ . I want to tear my hair out because what is in the bottle is what’s lethal!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To suggest that there have been no cases is perhaps an exaggeration, but the various studies we have on this tell a very different story from that reported in the press until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Scott-Ham of the UK's Forensic Science Service &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925334.400"&gt;led a study&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;"analysed samples taken from 1014 victims in the UK soon after the alleged assault between January 2000 and December 2002."&lt;/em&gt; They found sedatives in only 2% of samples (the presence of which could of course have several explanations. An &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/drink-spiking-claims-rejected/story-0-1225736032435"&gt;Australian study at two hospitals in Perth&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of the 97 young men and women who claimed to have had their drinks spiked had been drugged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if date rate drugs didn't cause these people to lose control of the situation, what was it? The UK Forensic Science Service study provides a big clue. Of the 391 victims who had given samples with 12 hours of the alleged assault, around a third had consumed enough alcohol to result in unconsciousness or memory loss. Similar results have come from &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/85513.php"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, scientific studies show that the #1 date rape drug, by far, is alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the British Journal of Criminology - &lt;em&gt;Understanding Heightened Risk Perception of Drink ‘Spiking’&lt;/em&gt; by Adam Burgess, Pamela Donovan and Sarah Moore, takes an interesting look at risk perceptions and psychology surrounding date rape drugs, conducting various surveys of students in Britain and the United States &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results highlighted the disproportionate level of risk attached to spiking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To better establish the strength of concern about DFSA, the UK respondents were asked to rate their sense of risk and sense of worry for the following four crimes: being a victim of drink-driving, being mugged, having a home or room burgled, and being a victim of DFSA (see Table 1 ). UK respondents were more likely to express acute worry about DFSA than any of the other crimes they were asked about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a drink spiked with drugs was the most commonly cited risk factor for sexual assault, with 150 (75 per cent) of participants identifying this as an important risk factor — a more signi? cant risk factor than drinking alcohol or taking drugs (see  Table 2 ). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that [spiking] elicited a more acute sense of worry amongst female students than mugging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in spite of the vanishingly small probability of drink spiking ever happening, students were more concerned about it than mugging, or drink driving. What is the explanation for this skewed perception of risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the bedsit here is alcohol, a drug which culturally we seem to be in a state of denial over. Part of the explanation may be that the myth of drink-spiking provides a useful narrative through which we can rationalize away our own guilt at drinking too much: &lt;em&gt;"I was in control of my drinking, but then somebody spiked my drink."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that true, or is it all a bit more complicated than that? We'll take a look in Part II of this post, which I'll be putting up this &lt;strike&gt;this evening&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;tomorrow&lt;/strike&gt; Friday (sorry, life and all that).&lt;/p&gt;

Or you did not even have to ask - I just gave you one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you won one of our contests in the past - a synchroblogging anniversary competition, or a Blog Pick Of The Month - in which case you also got one of the shirts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you attended one of the previous ScienceOnline meetings, you got a PLoS ONE shirt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years or so, I went through an enormous box of PLoS swag, not just shirts, but also stickers, mouse-pads, pens, decals, etc. Other PLoS employees do the same, whenever they travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="hamsters PLoS shirt.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/hamsters%20PLoS%20shirt.jpg" width="190" height="190" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And we'll keep doing this, of course. But now, we will have a much broader range of products to offer AND, most importantly, you don't have to wait to meet us - you can now order one for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, yesterday &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/11/16/feed-your-plos-t-shirt-obsession-announcing-the-new-plos-store/" title=""&gt;we launched&lt;/a&gt; the amazing &lt;a href="http://www.zazzle.com/plos" title=""&gt;PLoS Store&lt;/a&gt;.

We even &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/11/16/feed-your-plos-t-shirt-obsession-announcing-the-new-plos-store/" title=""&gt;peer-reviewed the shirts&lt;/a&gt; ourselves: San Francisco staffers got some shirts, wore them, washed them, and reported that they held up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000242" title=""&gt;Article-Level Metrics and the Evolution of Scientific Impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Formally published papers that have been through a traditional prepublication peer review process remain the most important means of communicating science today. Researchers depend on them to learn about the latest advances in their fields and to report their own findings. The intentions of traditional peer review are certainly noble: to ensure methodological integrity and to comment on potential significance of experimental studies through examination by a panel of objective, expert colleagues. In principle, this system enables science to move forward on the collective confidence of previously published work. Unfortunately, the traditional system has inspired methods of measuring impact that are suboptimal for their intended uses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000131" title=""&gt;The Unintended Consequences of Clinical Trials Regulations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of clinical researchers worldwide indicates that a major obstacle to undertaking academic research is the ever-increasing bureaucracy attached to the process. Recent changes in research governance were intended to ensure that clinical trials are safe and informative. However, the regulatory burden is now obstructing high quality science and has become the biggest single threat to research carried out in academia [1]. We illustrate here this international problem by reference to the regulations imposed by the European Union and the incorporation of these restrictions into UK national law concerning Good Clinical Practice (GCP).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000241" title=""&gt;Explaining the Linguistic Diversity of Sahul Using Population Models&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;About one-fifth of all the world's languages are spoken in present day Australia, New Guinea, and the surrounding islands. This corresponds to the boundaries of the ancient continent of Sahul, which broke up due to rising sea levels about 9000 years before present. The distribution of languages in this region conveys information about its population history. The recent migration of the Austronesian speakers can be traced with precision, but the histories of the Papuan and Australian language speakers are considerably more difficult to reconstruct. The speakers of these languages are presumably descendants of the first migrations into Sahul, and their languages have been subject to many millennia of dispersal and contact. Due to the antiquity of these language families, there is insufficient lexical evidence to reconstruct their histories. Instead we use abstract structural features to infer population history, modeling language change as a result of both inheritance and horizontal diffusion. We use a Bayesian phylogenetic clustering method, originally developed for investigating genetic recombination to infer the contribution of different linguistic lineages to the current diversity of languages. The results show the underlying structure of the diversity of these languages, reflecting ancient dispersals, millennia of contact, and probable phylogenetic groups. The analysis identifies 10 ancestral language populations, some of which can be identified with previously known phylogenetic groups (language families or subgroups), and some of which have not previously been proposed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007801" title=""&gt;The Evolution of a Capacity to Build Supra-Cellular Ropes Enabled Filamentous Cyanobacteria to Colonize Highly Erodible Substrates&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several motile, filamentous cyanobacteria display the ability to self-assemble into tightly woven or twisted groups of filaments that form macroscopic yarns or ropes, and that are often centimeters long and 50-200 µm in diameter. Traditionally, this trait has been the basis for taxonomic definition of several genera, notably Microcoleus and Hydrocoleum, but the trait has not been associated with any plausible function. Through the use of phylogenetic reconstruction, we demonstrate that pedigreed, rope-building cyanobacteria from various habitats do not form a monophyletic group. This is consistent with the hypothesis that rope-building ability was fixed independently in several discrete clades, likely through processes of convergent evolution or lateral transfer. Because rope-building cyanobacteria share the ability to colonize geologically unstable sedimentary substrates, such as subtidal and intertidal marine sediments and non-vegetated soils, it is also likely that this supracellular differentiation capacity imparts a particular fitness advantage in such habitats. The physics of sediment and soil erosion in fact predict that threads in the 50-200 µm size range will attain optimal characteristics to stabilize such substrates on contact. Rope building is a supracellular morphological adaptation in filamentous cyanobacteria that allows them to colonize physically unstable sedimentary environments, and to act as successful pioneers in the biostabilization process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000185" title=""&gt;The Link between Dengue Incidence and El Niño Southern Oscillation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a new study by Johansson and colleagues published in this issue of PLoS Medicine [12], the authors carry out statistical time-series analyses to examine the dynamic relationship between climate variables and the incidence of dengue in Thailand, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. They find no systematic association between multi-annual dengue outbreaks and El Niño Southern Oscillation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007861" title=""&gt;Avian Host-Selection by Culex pipiens in Experimental Trials&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evidence from field studies suggests that Culex pipiens, the primary mosquito vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the northeastern and north central United States, feeds preferentially on American robins (Turdus migratorius). To determine the contribution of innate preferences to observed preference patterns in the field, we conducted host preference trials with a known number of adult female C. pipiens in outdoor cages comparing the relative attractiveness of American robins with two common sympatric bird species, European starling, Sternus vulgaris and house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Host seeking C. pipiens were three times more likely to enter robin-baited traps when with the alternate host was a European starling (n = 4 trials; OR = 3.06; CI [1.42-6.46]) and almost twice more likely when the alternative was a house sparrow (n = 8 trials; OR = 1.80; CI = [1.22-2.90]). There was no difference in the probability of trap entry when two robins were offered (n = 8 trials). Logistic regression analysis determined that the age, sex and weight of the birds, the date of the trial, starting-time, temperature, humidity, wind-speed and age of the mosquitoes had no effect on the probability of a choosing a robin over an alternate bird. Findings indicate that preferential feeding by C. pipiens mosquitoes on certain avian hosts is likely to be inherent, and we discuss the implications innate host preferences may have on enzootic WNV transmission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000141" title=""&gt;How Can We Support the Use of Systematic Reviews in Policymaking?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the last few years the landscape has changed dramatically for policymakers seeking to use research evidence in the policymaking process. The landscape has also changed for the many stakeholders seeking to use research evidence to influence the policymaking process. The task once seemed overwhelming given the dearth of synthesized research evidence on the "big", typically multifaceted, questions that matter to policymakers and stakeholders [1],[2]. Now it isn't uncommon for these groups to find dozens of systematic reviews that address the governance, financial, and delivery arrangements within health systems that can determine whether a cost-effective program, service, or drug reaches those who need it. For example, teams of African policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers drew on 30 reviews for what at first glance seems a straightforward question: how to support the widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The review of qualitative studies of people's views about and experiences with medicine sellers provided insights that were as central to the process as reviews of the effectiveness of a particular ACT formulation or the home-based management of malaria [3]-[5].&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_66.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/aGqTy1XSAzg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258463949297"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_452.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0179288c4673c53c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-11-17T12:03:58Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T12:03:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/5c5ztyva2t4/todays_carnivals_452.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/todays_carnivals_452.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientia Pro Publica #16 is up on &lt;a href="http://www.sharpbrains.com/blog/2009/11/16/scientia-pro-publica-16-us-friends-and-society/" title=""&gt;SharpBrains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over at the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, Anthony Grayling &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/nov/16/john-denham-faith-groups"&gt;takes this truly bad idea apart&lt;/a&gt; with a series of rhetorical questions, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what, Mr Denham, of the rule of law as this will be viewed by your faith advisers? Is each citizen of this country equal before the same law for all, or will injustice and discrimination thrive behind the closed doors of faith-based courts? Are each of the faiths to be allowed exceptions and exemptions – for example, so that any faith school can exclude well-qualified teachers because they do not share the ancient superstition with which a particular school seeks to brainwash small children’s minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Mr Denham, why is your policy so discriminatory in itself? What of the Buddhists, the Zoroastrians, the Mother Goddess worshippers? What of the Druids, the White Witches, the Pagans, the astrologers, the Satanists? Are these not “faith groups” whose outlooks have precisely as much credibility and evidence-base as the Christians and Muslims? Are you going to include them and give them some of our tax money too? Can I start an “I Believe in Fairies” church and can I come to your meetings and get some government hand-outs too? If not, why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let me explain why I did this and see if it makes sense. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My goal was to overwhelm the believer. I learned this from my mentor James Strauss at Lincoln Christian University, Lincoln, IL. He did this to his Seminary students. The syllabi he handed out for each one of his classes were sometimes books in and of themselves. They included extensive bibliographies. Sometimes they were annotated bibliographies. In his classes he was able to remember and refer to these works quite fluently, and he expected us to get many of them for his classes. We were overwhelmed by him and his arguments because of his wide ranging knowledge of the relevant literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one expects to change someone's mind about a whole religious worldview s/he must overwhelm the believer. That is my conclusion, and it comes directly from Strauss, but in reverse, since I'm arguing against what he taught. Nothing short of that will do the trick. Strauss was interested in religious worldview change and he taught us well by personal example. To change one's religious worldview means that every key religious belief must be called into question at the same time, if at all possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I attempted to do this in my book. I presented a whole case, a complete case, a comprehensive case, from start to finish as a former insider to Christianity. I threw everything at the believer plus the kitchen sink. I referred to as many books as I could in it, using the very words of other scholars to argue for me so readers can see for themselves that it's not just me saying these things. I did this over and over and...well you get the point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this unique goal of mine I was also able to get together some great recommendations for it which were placed on the back cover and inside front pages. You can &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;read them plus others here&lt;/a&gt;. Having multiple recommendations also helps to overwhelm the believer, since if so many people are saying such great things about it, this can challenge anyone who wants to think otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the book may be a bit difficult reading because of this, especially some of the first few substantive chapters, what I did can be very effective as a change agent. Again, nothing short of overwhelming the believer has a chance to work in my opinion. This then is the reason for so many references quoted in my book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, since in order to overwhelm the believer I had to question every key belief of Christianity, my problem was that as a mere mortal I could not have a scholar's grasp on every topic in it. Science is actually my weakest area, especially the creation/evolution debate. So sometimes I merely refer believers to what scholars in their respective fields of research have argued. No one can have a scholars grasp of God and the universe using the disciplines of science, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, the Bible, and apologetics. No one. So I constantly refer my readers to the scholars who argue my case for me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;My goal was to overwhelm the believer in just one thick densely packed comprehensively argued book replete with references for further reading.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people understand this. Others don't. Now you know the rest of the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[First posted 11/17/09]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: You see, I aim to persuade, and because I do believers think I'll use any trick in the book. That is most emphatically a non-sequitur. I use rational arguments in my persuading. I know more than I can say, and since I am nearly certain that Christianity is a delusion because of the totality of the things I know that I can't say, I aim to persuade. Christians do this as well. They seek to persuade. They "know" more than they can say, and since they are nearly certain that Christianity is true because of the totality of the things they "know" that they can't say, they seek to persuade. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE MANY LIARS FOR JESUS OUT THERE. These liars for Jesus will lie because they know Jesus is their savior. So anything they can do or say to convert people is worth it when it comes to saving people from hell. Just ask Christians if they are happy with someone who converts for less than adequate reasons, and you'll see that they do. Many Christian scholars think Josh McDowell's &lt;i&gt;Evidences&lt;/i&gt; books are not rationally persuasive, but they do convert. So Christians are happy of the end result because of the totality of all the things they claim to know. And then these scholars hope to show these converts the real reasons for faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, I do not think people are all that rational. We are sometimes hopelessly irrational. Many psychological studies &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-do-you-know-that-which-you-claim-to.html"&gt;have shown this&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who has the slightest understanding of epistemology knows this. Since that is true I have an additional reason to be skeptical of absolute and certainly held positive faith claims. I think Christians cannot be reasoned out of their faith since they were never reasoned into it it the first place. So along with my reasoned case I must also seek to persuade. There is nothing inconsistent at all about my approach. I must overwhelm the brainwashed and indoctrinated believer in order to persuade them to adopt the adult attitude of skepticism. Nothing else will work if this doesn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, the fact that I must overwhelm the believer in order to persuade them otherwise is not my fault. It's that fault of their delusion. Lacking an intervention (which they will not tolerate for one moment) this is what must be done in lieu of one.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2322791475422087348?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

And by true, I mean false. It’s all lies. But they’re entertaining lies, and in the end isn’t that the real truth? The answer is no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the little skeptic of the show herself, Homer’s daughter Lisa quotes to him from “&lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine,” which I think was inspired by &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine itself since I’ve met Matt Groening and some of their writers are subscribers to &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;. Either way, though, I thought the timing was right to launch a new magazine, but since we could not afford to publish and distribute it as a separate magazine we decided to tip it into the back of every issue of Skeptic magazine, where it still resides today. The early issues were fun to do, but all of us struggled to find the right voice for &lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine amidst our already too busy work schedule of just trying to get the regular magazine out in time. But then along came Daniel Loxton, who locked up the voice of &lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine as his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel is a clear and concise writer who really knows how to communicate any topic with clarity, wit, and detail to accuracy. Of the thousands of articles that I have edited over the decades, Daniel’s are among the best ever written and in need of the least amount of editing. There’s no attempt at fancy schmancy literary hocus pocus that you often find in academics who wannabe lit crit deconstructionists (what Dawkins calls “obscurantists”). Daniel cuts to the chase of a topic and weaves the facts into a compelling narrative story. You know, the kind that kids like to read…and adults: one of the most common letters we receive is from our adult readers almost (but not quite) too embarrassed to admit that they prefer reading &lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine to &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, starting next Tuesday, Daniel and I will alternate weeks posting here at Skepticblog, and I am going to start posting more regularly — probably two times a week — over at &lt;a href="http://www.trueslant.com/"&gt;TRUE/SLANT&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively new site that I find especially appealing at the scope and breadth of their topics and bloggers. This will give me a chance to reach new people and bring the skeptical message to new audiences. We can’t just preach to the choir, which I fear I do too much of, and even though I occasionally blog at HuffingtonPost, there I am lost in a sea of celebrities and television hosts (you know who I mean!) and over 2,000 other bloggers, which ends up feeling like a complete waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I would encourage everyone to check out TRUE/SLANT, where you will find me posting, starting today, at: &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/michaelshermer/"&gt;http://trueslant.com/michaelshermer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And please say hi to Daniel and welcome him into the skeptical blogosphere, and if you have any suggestions on topics you’d like him to cover just drop your suggestions into the comments box that goes with this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

He was particularly stung by &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/10/20/open-letter-to-bill-maher-on-vaccinations/"&gt;Michael Shermer’s open letter&lt;/a&gt; in which Dr. Shermer thought it necessary to give Maher a basic lesson in germ theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html"&gt;Maher has responded&lt;/a&gt; not by thoughtfully engaging his critics, but with a rambling defensive diatribe in which he simultaneously protests the criticism pointed his way while repeating and amplifying the pseudoscientific nonsense that garnered criticism in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher presents what we call a target rich environment for skepticism, so I don’t think I will be able to address every point, but I will hit the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listeners of the &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;SGU podcast&lt;/a&gt; are familiar with our “name that &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/how-to-argue/"&gt;logical fallacy&lt;/a&gt;” segment. In his second paragraphs Maher offers up enough fallacies to supply this segment for a month. Take a crack at it yourselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with my critics who say there are far more qualified people than me — its just that mainstream media rarely interviews doctors and scientists who present an alternative point of view. There is a movement to stop people from asking any questions about vaccines — they’re a miracle, that’s it, debate over. I don’t think its that simple, and neither do millions of other people. The British Medical Journal from August 25 says half the doctors and medical workers in the U.K. are not taking the flu shot — are they all crazy too? Sixty-five percent of French people don’t want it. Maybe its not as simple as the medical establishment wants to paint it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher is willing to admit that he is not an expert, but then he follows this statement with a long post in which he feels free to express his views on vaccines and medicine in general. He should have just stopped after that first sentence. He seems to be saying – I am not an expert, so don’t hold me accountable for anything I say, but I am going to say it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then follows with a common claim for Maher – that the mainstream media (apparently he does not consider himself part of the mainstream media) rarely interviews experts with an alternate point of view. This is a bold assertion that strikes me as utter hogwash. I admit perception here is subjective, but it seems to me that the mainstream media gives disproportionate attention to fringe experts and minority opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at Oprah, Larry King, just about every talk show and morning show, and Maher himself – the mainstream media loves the fringe. At best we get token skepticism. Who is Maher kidding? But everyone wants to portray themselves as the embattled minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher goes beyond that and borrows a page right out of the creationist playbook when he writes: “There is a movement to stop people from asking any questions about vaccines — they’re a miracle, that’s it, debate over.” Right – just like we want to dogmatically stop debate about Darwin, and the 9/11 truth movement, and the hollow earth – and every other crackpot claim out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher confuses concern over the quality of reporting and information with a desire to inhibit free speech. Calling nonsense what it is does NOT equal attempting to silence it. When we call Maher on his pseudoscientific rubbish, this is not some big mainstream conspiracy to shut down debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also – his attitude assumes that there is a legitimate debate to be had – just like the creationists in all their whining about “teach the controversy” assume a controversy where there is none (not a scientific controversy, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no mainstream controversy over vaccines, not because of dogma but because the science is very solidly in one direction – vaccines are safe and effective. Repeating long-debunked misinformation does not create a genuine controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes many of us in the skeptical community that Maher is a picture of self-contradiction in this position. He criticizes 9/11 truthers and creationists, but then commits the identical logical fallacies in attacking vaccines and modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher finishes off that paragraph with an argument from authority combined with an argument from popularity. Right  – and (depending upon which highly unreliable poll you want to listen to) a majority of Americans doubt evolution, and a third of the public thinks Bush had something to do with 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy – the anti-vaccine movement scaremongers about vaccines, and then points out that there is a lot of fear of vaccines in the public, so there must be something there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, he gives us some more apologetics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m just trying to represent an under-reported medical point of view in this country, I’m not telling a specific pregnant lady what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, my audience is bright, they wouldn’t refuse a flu shot because they heard me talk about it, but if they looked into the subject a little more, how is that a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same kind of lame excuse for intellectual sloppiness that Oprah gave – hey, my audience is smart enough not to listen to me. I’m just putting this out there, asking questions – what, do you want a fascist state that doesn’t allow people to ask questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “I’m just asking questions” gambit is a particularly disingenuous one. I wonder what Maher thinks when Fox pulls this stunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point Maher keeps missing is that he is making claims that have been debunked – they are not based on a fair reading of the science, and his logic is strained at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s get to some specifics. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point I am representing is: Is getting frequent vaccinations for any and all viruses consequence-free?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice straw man. I can see Maher wants to hit as many logical fallacies in one post as possible. Maybe he thinks it’s like shooting the moon in hearts – if you get them all, you win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is recommending “frequent” vaccinations, or vaccines for “any and all virsues?” There are thousands of viruses out there, and vaccines for just a few. I wouldn’t mind a few more – HIV would be nice. And who is saying that vaccinations are “consequence free” – and what does that mean, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are careful to point out that vaccines are not risk free. They have side effects, and even rare serious adverse effects – like all medical interventions. They even go out of their way to report and catalogue all the side effects – that’s a standard part of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s your question, Maher, then the answer is no, but irrelevant. (A significant sign of intellectual sloppiness or naivete is not being able to ask the right question, or even cogent questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right question is – what is the risk-benefit ratio of vaccines? We have mountains of data on this question, and the answer is – there is significant benefit in excess of risk. So much so that vaccines are one of the best medical interventions invented by scientific medicine. Really – it doesn’t get much better than vaccines for benefit in excess of risk. But we won’t stop monitoring them, or asking the right questions anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t resist pointing out a bit of irony in his post. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But apparently it’s (Twitter) taken very seriously, because there was Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services what she thought about the fact that “Bill Maher told his viewers anyone who gets a flu shot is an idiot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. It was twittered, which I guess doesn’t make a huge difference, but as 60 Minutes is the last bastion of TV journalism, accuracy is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Maher is dinging 60 Minutes for an inconsequential factual error – viewers vs twitter followers. But then Maher writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it to get vaccines for every bug that goes around? Injecting something into my bloodstream?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would think vaccines containing many different dicey substances shot directly into the bloodstream have a slightly greater chance of secondary effects than a piece of fabric lying across your waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher has been corrected before on the fact that vaccines are intra-muscular injections – they are not injected “directly into the bloodstream.” And what “dicey substances” are we talking about, exactly? I guess it’s OK for Maher to play it loose with the facts as long as it is for the purpose of fear-mongering about an effective medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is much to criticize in Maher’s style, his substance is worse. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I’ve been saying is that Western medicine ignores too much the fact that the terrain in which bacteria can thrive is crucial and often controllable, which shouldn’t even be controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more style point though – “Western” medicine is a euphemism for “scientific” medicine and is only used by those with an anti-science agenda. It is meant to imply that science is not universal, but culturally Western.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which part should not be controversial – that “the terrain” is important or that scientific medicine ignores this fact? What evidence does Maher have that modern medicine ignores the immune system? I believe there is an entire medical specialty dedicated to the immune system (several, actually). Infectious Disease specialists routinely consider the host in assessing the best course of action to take in preventing and treating infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Maher wants to pretend he lives in a cartoon world where doctors treat everything simple-mindedly with drugs and surgery, and don’t consider the patient as a whole. It really is an annoyingly childish view of modern medicine – about as accurate as a creationist’s view of evolutionary biology. It is a product of propaganda from those hostile to science-based medicine. It also is profoundly arrogant – a product of the casual assumption of moral and intellectual superiority. Maher apparently has no problem assuming he has a more thoughtful approach to medicine than the entire medical profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this point he also writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…and if your immune system is already compromised by, for example, eating a typical American diet, then a flu shot can make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is assuming that the American diet compromises the immune system. I would like to see a reference or twelve to support that claim. The American diet is far from optimal, but the evidence overwhelmingly shows its defects are in excess, not insufficiency. Americans are not malnourished, and their immune systems (in general, of course) are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher has the true-belief that infections can be treated and prevented solely by “boosting” the immune system with diet and nutrition. This, however, is a fantasy of the supplement industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, perfectly healthy people can succumb to a bad infection. Maher also ignores the fact that the best way to protect those who are not perfectly healthy, or do have compromised immune systems, is through herd immunity – for healthy people to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some reluctant acknowledgment that vaccines maybe are not all bad, Maher writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe the immune system doesn’t like being tricked so many times. Maybe we should be studying that instead of shouting down debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? The “being tricked” thing was a metaphor Shermer used to explain vaccines a bit to Maher. The immune system responds to vaccines the same way it responds to getting exposed to viruses or bacteria from other sources – getting a cold, or just getting exposed even without mounting an infection. I sure hope my immune system “likes” responding over and over again to immunological challenge, because it is going to have to do just that on a daily basis for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher perpetuates the anti-vaccine fiction that the immune system response to a vaccine is fundamentally different than the response to any infection or exposure to a germ. It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more nonsense in this post – it is so dense with logical fallacies and misinformation, that I just can’t hit it all. He goes on to conflate issues about overuse of antibiotics with vaccines. Yes, Maher – we are talking about the overuse of antibiotics. It is being studied to death, and we are trying to balance our duty to save individual patients with the long term effectiveness of our antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher then states that the “experts” he looks to on this issue are Barbara Loe Fisher, Dr. Russell Blaylock, and Dr. Jay Gordon – anti-vaccine cranks all. That’s Maher’s problem – he might as well take an evolution lesson from Casey Luskin, Michael Behe, and Dr. Egnor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I think that might resolve part of the paradox that is Bill Maher. He demonstrates that someone who is generally intelligent, able to form rational opinions on many issues, and has been successful in a competitive profession, is also able to climb inside a bubble of pseudoscience on a particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy for anyone to be overwhelmed by an organized campaign of misinformation. I know very bright people who were blown away by Loose Change when they first saw it. I know otherwise intelligent people who just cannot handle the systematic lies and distortions of the creationists – they don’t have the background and the volumes of information it would take to tackle each false claim and logical fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the alternative medicine and anti-vaccine movement – they have a highly developed package of propaganda, misinformation, and subtle distortions  – wrapped in a feel-good and empowering philosophy, that can easily overwhelm even an intelligent person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Maher has now stepped into this controversy, even though he apparently doesn’t like it. I guess he only likes getting praise from his audience, and is chaffing under the harsh criticism some of his view have engendered (and I don’t mean from his ideological opponents – something we all enjoy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also – like it or not – he is a public personality and his views affect the public. If he is going to tackle medical issues, he needs to do a far better job of exposing himself openly to the “other ” side, by which I mean science-based medicine. He cannot hide behind the “I’m just a silly comedian, no ones takes me seriously, I’m just asking questions” gambit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He should seriously consider the possibility that he is about as well informed on vaccines and other medical issues as creationists are on evolution. He should not dismiss his critics (while he is criticizing others for being dismissive) and he should take very seriously the fact that he is at odds with the scientific and skeptical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the criticism will continue – not to shut him up, but to do damage control. Maher is contributing to the public misunderstanding of science in perhaps the most important area – medicine. That is very serious, and he needs to start taking it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying one of my infrequent laptop days, that is, days during which it actually makes sense for me to tote such a device around. I type these words from the &lt;a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konradsberg"&gt;Konradsberg&lt;/a&gt; campus of the University of Stockholm. Konradsberg is a name that resonates in my city's history, because it used to be one of the main mental hospitals, known colloquially as the "Castle of Madmen". I haven't been committed (yet). I'm here for the second day of the &lt;a href="http://www.sub.su.se/omsub/visaevenemanget.aspx?eid=89"&gt;Wikipedia Academy 2009&lt;/a&gt; conference, representing my employer, the Royal Academy of Letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get on-line I had to solve a decidedly analog problem. The scrape cards the organisers hand out with login info for the wifi here are poorly made: the stuff you need to scrape off is tougher than the underlying plastic film on which the information is printed. So my first attempt ended with me scraping the print off. This reminds me of the techno-optimism of the 60s where archaeologists on Gotland produced extremely detailed photographic excavation reports but forgot to check if the glue they used was archive-safe. In the 90s those reports were all falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I'm taking a wifi-enabled fast train to Gothenburg to give an &lt;a href="http://techrisk.se/?p=1237"&gt;information security talk&lt;/a&gt; at the IT University there. Then back home to Stockholm. All with a lovely dinky netbook in my backpack, one whose Ubuntu installation is sadly dead but whose Windows installation still works. Better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had no time to post about the Royal Society meetings, which were full of good talks and good fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Barton spoke on the evolution of sex (summary: it’s still a mystery), and there were talks by John Willis on &lt;em&gt;Mimulus&lt;/em&gt;, Spencer Barrett on heterostyly in plants, Holly Wichman on viruses as models of evolution, Dolph Schluter on sticklebacks, and many others on varied aspects of evolutionary genetics.  When I return in late November I’ll try to post some of the intersting things I’ve learned, including the story of a South African plant that has evolved, as part of its ground-hugging flower, a PERCH on which sunbirds sit while sipping nectar and pollinating the plant.  This is the only case I know of in which a plant has evolved a perch to specifically accommodate birds, although of course many species of flowers (including &lt;em&gt;Mimulus lewisii&lt;/em&gt;), have evolved “landing platforms” from their petals to allow bees to alight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find out that the Royal Society headquarters on Carlton Terrace used to be the German Embassy until WWII.  Buried in the Royal Society Garden is a dog with a headstone, a name, and the epiphet “ein treues Hund” (a faithful dog), said to be Ribbentrop’s dog, although this is disputed. (The dog may belong to his predecessor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news of the day is this: future GOP wacko Presidential candidate Sarah Palin doesn’t accept evolution. In her piece on Palin’s soon-to-be-best-seller, &lt;em&gt;Going Rogue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/15book.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;ref=books"&gt;NYT reviewer Michiko Kakutani reports&lt;/a&gt; that Palin doesn’t accept evolution.  But first, some tidbits, which you will learn here first because you are NOT going to buy this book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all Ms. Palin emerges from “Going Rogue” as an eager player in the blame game, ungrateful to the McCain campaign for putting her on the national stage. As for the McCain campaign, it often feels like a desperate and cynical operation, willing to make a risky Hail Mary pass to try to score a tactical win, instead of making a considered judgment as to who might be genuinely qualified to sit a heartbeat away from the Oval Office . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . Ms. Palin suggests that she and her husband, Todd, are ideally qualified to represent the Joe Six-Packs of the world because they are Joe Six-Packs themselves. “We know what it’s like to be on a tight budget and wonder how we’re going to pay for our own health care, let alone college tuition,” she writes in “Going Rogue.” “We know what it’s like to work union jobs, to be blue-collar, white-collar, to have our kids in public schools. We felt our very normalcy, our status as ordinary Americans, could be a much-needed fresh breeze blowing into Washington, D.C.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in this volume she talks about creationism, saying she “didn’t believe in the theory that human beings — thinking, loving beings — originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea” or from “monkeys who eventually swung down from the trees.” In everything that happens to her, from meeting Todd to her selection by Mr. McCain for the Republican ticket, she sees the hand of God: “My life is in His hands. I encourage readers to do what I did many years ago, invite Him in to take over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a problem with Francis Collin’s evangelic Christianity when he was appointed head of the NIH, but will those of you who criticized these reservations be equally accommodating of Palin’s overweening faith? I doubt it.  Her denial of evolution alone disqualifies her to be President, for it shows her sheer, blind resistance  to facts–at least those facts at odds with her  faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: the woman is just plain dumb (and don’t tell me how media-savvy she is), and it’s a testimony to the desperation of the Republican Party that many of them are enthusiastic about electing the first president who openly embraces creationism.  Let’s not invite Her in to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

He volunteered his services at no charge and stuck with us even when we requested changes late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you all the additional details that get discussed when this sort of video gets made &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   Needless to say, we had a lot of talks about the content and I hope it’s worth the effort that &lt;a href="http://collectionagencyfilms.com/"&gt;Dano’s team&lt;/a&gt; put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he did a wonderful job and I am proud to finally share the final product with everyone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UPw-3e_pzqU%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know I've used this clip before at least twice and the line in it several more times over the last couple of years. However, sometimes it's just so completely appropriate to how I'm feeling about a topic I'm about to write about that I just don't care and have to use it again. This is one of those times. The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;2009 recipient of the Richard Dawkins Award&lt;/a&gt; bestowed upon him by the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/conventions/2009/index.htm"&gt;Atheist Alliance International&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;a href="http://www.billmaher.com"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;, anti-vaccine comedian and host of &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/"&gt;Real Time With Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;, has decided, after an all too brief absence, to lay down a swath of burning stupid about vaccines again. When last we left Maher, he was busily embarrassing himself on the last two episodes of his television show, first by getting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_2009_recipient_of_the_richard_dawkin.php"&gt;slapped down hard by Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;, of all people (and, after his antics during the Terry Schiavo controversy, Bill Frist comes across as the voice of reason compared to Maher, Maher's got a serious problem) and next having his arguments dismembered unceremoniously on the season finale of his show, concluding with his having his head handed to him (nay punted right back at him like a smug, smirking football) by Chris Matthews, who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_2009_recipient_of_the_richard_dawkin_1.php"&gt;compared him to a celebrity Scientologist like Tom Cruise attacking psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horrified look on Maher's face was priceless. Direct, hit Chris, right below the waterline. I only wish you had had time to finish the job while the woo ship Maher was listing and taking on water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had, I might not have had to see this assault on reason by Maher published on Sunday on--where else?--that bastion of anti-vaccine quackery, The Huffington Post, in the form of a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-maher/vaccination-a-conversatio_b_358578.html"&gt;Vaccination: A Conversation Worth Having&lt;/a&gt;, a post that he also crossposted on his own blog &lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Well...I&amp;#39;ve come up with yet another kooky hypothesis addressing a behavior falling under the category of parasomnia.Somniloquy or sleep-talking happens during stages of NREM sleep, the time declarative memory (i.e. factual knowledge) is consolidated. This seemingly bizarre behavior typically occurs in childhood and is outgrown by puberty. Presentation can vary from rhythmic nonsense words to long coherent speeches. No one really knows where it comes from. The most popular answer seems to be because of stress.We could just leave it at that, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really explain why it came about in the first place. I have a hard time simply writing-off weird behaviors that have managed to stick around for long periods of time. In my head I&amp;#39;m thinking &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s just gotta be a functional purpose&amp;quot;!Here&amp;#39;s what I think NREM sleep-talking is all about. Somniloquy is just behavioral evidence of the maturing brain consolidating syntactical and semantical aspects of language. It&amp;#39;s also important to note that the calm quality of NREM sleep-talk is very different compared to the loud and emotional sleep-talk found during rapid eye movement behavior disorder. This makes a lot of sense. REM sleep is known to process emotional memory so of course you&amp;#39;d see this kind of late night emotionally charged verbal diarrhea. Some have postulated that this irratic unconscious behavior protected the stressed out sleep deprived caveman from hungry predators looking for some easy eats. On the flip side, factual bits of data like &amp;quot;Paris is the capital of France&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t emotional at all (unless you&amp;#39;re strangely disturbed by this bit of info) and that&amp;#39;s why you hear the flat affect during NREM somniloquy.So there you go. I&amp;#39;ve laid out a tentative explanation for NREM somniloquy. I haven&amp;#39;t seen anything else around to explain this more pleasant form of sleep-talking. If you spot any let me know. It&amp;#39;d be cool if we could figure out a way to induce somniloquy in different stages of sleep and observe what the brain was doing.In the meantime, I wouldn&amp;#39;t fret too much over your kids mumbling something about world domination as they nap. They&amp;#39;re probably just learning how to orate more effectively. Gais S, &amp;amp; Born J (2004). Declarative memory consolidation: mechanisms acting during human sleep.

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*****&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, it’s the afternoon on the day that the Year 12 students in Western Australia do the first &lt;a href="http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/Senior_Secondary/Courses/Philosophy_and_Ethics"&gt;Philosophy and Ethics end-of-year exam. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to get a copy of that exam after it has been completed by students today and will blog a general overview of the content. I think it will be of interest to all of those who are wanting to know about the teaching of the course and how it’s being examined in this state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall how &lt;a href="http://www.naontiotami.com"&gt;Australian blogger Naontiotami&lt;/a&gt; did a rather popular YouTube report on his practice exam that he did in Victoria, about skeptically-minded content on a paper (&lt;a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vcaa/vce/exams/gat/questionbooklets/2009/2009GATcpr-w.pdf"&gt;GAT Question Booklet&lt;/a&gt; (PDF – 954KB – page 8 from the paper) that he did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTXfVHpN34"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTXfVHpN34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTXfVHpN34"&gt;Skepticism in the GAT?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – One of my mid-year exams in high-school contained a question that was decidedly skeptical, pertaining to cold reading. This is a video about that question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll endeavour to either do a video myself, or perhaps just give an outline. I’m looking forward to seeing what our state has to offer this year and how it might indicate how future years might progress with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that it is not unusual to have Philosophy taught as a subject to high-school students in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald, outlined what exists in an interview with Peter Ellerton (who will be speaking at the forthcoming Australian Skeptics convention in a fortnight’s time): &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/why-is-philosophy-such-a-fizzer-in-schools/2008/08/24/1219516262706.html"&gt;Just think: it’s important’ in the Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaching of philosophy in Queensland high schools is not new. The subject has been taught, in one form or another, for 50 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other states have been quick to catch up, with Western Australia introducing a philosophy high-school program in the last year, and Victoria in the past five years. But in NSW the situation remains uncertain. The NSW Board of Studies offers philosophy as a distinction course only to students who have already sat the HSC exams….the Board of Studies data shows only 54 students enrolled in the philosophy distinction course last year. The Board of Studies also endorses school-developed courses in general philosophy, but only a handful of high schools in NSW that have taken up this offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had discussions with people whose first response is not ‘great, there’s a course!’ but ‘is it only for private schools?’ Such a concern is raised by the likes of &lt;a href="http://www20.sbs.com.au/podcasting/index.php?action=feeddetails&amp;amp;feedid=12&amp;amp;id=7380"&gt;Stephen Law, who was interviewed on SBS&lt;/a&gt; about the themes and issues raised in his book “&lt;a href="http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/"&gt;The War for Children’s Minds&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased to respond that the course is indeed open to all schools and the recent &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/10/philosothon-tomorrow-hale-school/"&gt;Hale School Philosothon&lt;/a&gt; reflected how a range of schools are, if not adopting, are interested in incorporating Philosophy as a student activity. You can listen to an interview with one of the coordinators, featured on &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast (episode #45).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, finding qualified teachers is difficult. Yes, training is offered by groups like the West Australian Association for Philosophy in Schools and I know of some universities that can offer subjects to help train teachers too. There are more and more schools interested in taking on Philosophy and Ethics – but it’s problematic when Philosophy is still somewhat seen as a ’soft Arts subject’ and teachers entering the profession usually are urged to study more ‘traditional’ subject areas to become teachers in. If a course is only a final year one (Years 11 and 12), it may be seen as limiting to only qualify to teach those two years – which is a pity when there are programs to teach Philosophy, such as the Community of Inquiry model, from K-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are qualified to teach Philosophy and Ethics in this state are more than likely coming from a Theology/Philosophy background, which is not unusual. In my opinion, it’d be wonderful to have a range of teachers with a variety of backgrounds too – such as Science, Maths, Arts, Humanities and the like, who can all draw upon their Philosophy training to contribute to the teaching of the course. Perhaps time will change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions – and I hope to discuss this futher with conference attendees at events like the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au"&gt;Australian Skeptics convention&lt;/a&gt; and the forthcoming &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/kylie-sturgess/"&gt;Global Atheist Australian conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING NEWS – the examination featured a discussion of the podcast &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/"&gt;Skepticality&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; Whilst texts like podcasts have been used in transcript form in exams before, I suspect that this is the first skeptic podcast that has been used. &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I was listening to a podcast the other day, called ‘Skepticality’…&lt;/em&gt;” – the topic was the Discovery Institute and what constitutes free, fair and open debate on the topic of creationism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ability of an organism to confront ever-shifting environmental attributes with resilience and flexibility is critical to maintaining lineages with the capacity to undergo the morphological and behavioral modifications required for continued survival. Irregardless if such elastic traits are realized through major swings in ontogenic development, or through the advent of novel life-history strategies, the ability of an organism to accommodate ecological variability is essential. This biological tenet is certainly true today as anthropogenically incited climate change is forcing accelerated rates of ecological alteration.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that mean global temperatures could increase by more than six-degrees over the course of the next century. Six degrees of global change translates to extremely dramatic transformations of biotic and abiotic conditions at the local level. Even if the ‘worse case scenario’ of six-degrees doesn’t come to pass, changes in hydrology, periodic weather, seasonal patterns, emigration, extinction and available resources at the regional and local levels are almost certainly inevitable during the next century. To cope with these changes organisms will be required to adjust their tolerances to environmental variability, they may need to more-efficiently utilize the resources on-hand, or they may need to physically relocate to habitats for which they are better suited. The relative standing of an organism in its environment and the ways in which it behaviorally responds to its surroundings can be referred to as the organism’s ‘niche’.With respect to etymology, the word ‘niche’ is derived from the French word ‘nicher’ which literally means ‘to nest,’ as in a bird going to nest. In regards to the word’s use in biology – broadly defined above - this literal translation is very appropriate, because the term was first introduced by an ornithologist in a publication describing the distribution of the California thrasher (Toxostoma redivivum).The California thrasher is the largest member of the Mimidae Family and can grow to be uupwards of 30 cm in length and weigh as much as 85 grams. The bird’s coloration is fairly non-descript; its body is brown and it has a tan or buff-colored ventral side. A couple of characteristics that make T. redivivum especially unique are its restriction to a very narrow geographic range in California, and its habitat preference for densely vegetated brushlands. It was the thrasher’s limited distribution and fondness for the concealment offered by shrubs that first attracted the interest of the celebrated naturalist and scientist Joseph Grinnell.In the October 1917 issue of The Auk, Joseph Grinnell published his work 'The Niche-Relationships of the California Thrasher'. In that enduring contribution Grinnell explained that the reason for the thrasher’s“…restricted distribution is probably to be found in the close adjustment of the bird in various physiological and psychological respects to a narrow range of environmental condition.”In other words, Grinnell clearly recognized that the bird’s morphological and behavioral traits linked it to the specific ecosystem that it inhabited. Furthermore, Grinnell identified that“[t]hese various circumstances, which emphasize dependence upon cover, and adaptation in physical structure and temperament thereto, go to demonstrate the nature of the ultimate associational niche occupied by the California Thrasher.”In Grinnell’s mind, the relative position of the thrasher in its environment, as well as its distinctive behaviors, established a general rule that could be extrapolated and used as a tool for detailing and predicting the spatial and temporal relationships held between organisms and their environments. The ‘niche’ would quickly become a tool for not only itemizing individual life-history traits, but also for interpreting the evolutionary and adaptive implications of the organism-to-environment dynamic.Building on his idea of an ecological niche, in July of 1924 Grinnell went on to publish ‘Geography and Evolution,’ a work in which he fathered what are contemporarily known as the competitive exclusion principle and the concept of ‘vacant niches.’“Some of us have concluded that we can usefully recognize, as measures of distributional behavior, the realm, the region, the life-zone, the fauna, the subfauna, the association, and the ecologic or environmental niche. The latter, ultimate unit, is occupied by just one species or subspecies; if a new ecologic niche arises, or if a niche is vacated, nature hastens to supply an occupant, from whatever material may be available. Nature abhors a vacuum in the animate world as well as in the inanimate world.” The competitive exclusion principle is the idea that two species occupying the same habitat, and fighting for the same resources, will not obtain equilibrium until one species overcomes – or, out competes - the other. These ideas are front-and-center to modern biology and are both credited to Grinnell.Serving as the founding father of the ‘niche’ was but one of Joseph Grinnell’s numerous contributions to science. Over the next couple of days more of Grinnell’s work will be posted as will that of his modern counterparts that are – literally – following in Grinnell’s footsteps in hopes of gaining insight as to how the observations of an early 20th Century scientist can be used to decode the effects of climate change in a 21st Century world.Joseph Grinnell (1917).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gathering of healthcare leaders with a shared vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event focuses on the the [sic] true causes and effects of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including new treatments available for this rapidly emerging crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these comments sound ideology-driven. I would not expect to find language like this for, say, a conference organized by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. This conference was organized by the &lt;a href="http://www.aaemonline.org/"&gt;American Academy of Environmental Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. I did some checking, and it seems the AAEM is not your average academy, and environmental medicine is not your average specialty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAEM is &lt;a href="http://www.abms.org/Who_We_Help/Physicians/specialties.aspx"&gt;not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It is &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html"&gt;listed as a questionable organization on Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;. And the American Board of Environmental Medicine is listed as a &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html"&gt;dubious certifying board.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The environmental AAEM should not be confused with the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, a reputable specialty organization that also carries the initials AAEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.aaemonline.org/"&gt;AAEM website&lt;/a&gt;  says:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have escalated dramatically in modern times. Most current treatments for these disorders primarily involve &lt;strong&gt;drugs that suppress the symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A quickly growing body of scientific evidence has revealed how many important inflammatory and autoimmune diseases are caused by &lt;strong&gt;man’s interaction with the environment, both internally and externally&lt;/strong&gt;. At the AAEM, &lt;strong&gt;we understand this interaction&lt;/strong&gt;. We can provide you with the answers you need and new insights that will open the door to newer and more effective, specific, &lt;strong&gt;cause-oriented, and preventive treatment for most of these conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? We’ve seen this kind of language from proponents of all kinds of alternative medicine. I’m surprised they didn’t use the word “allopathic” or attack evil Big Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked up the members of the AAEM in my local area, one very disreputable name jumped out at me: &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aqa.html"&gt;Jonathan Wright&lt;/a&gt;. He has been in trouble with the FDA repeatedly for numerous violations and at one point he posted a notice saying that state-licensed physicians are “exempt from the restrictions and regulations of the federal Food and Drug Administration as a matter of federal law.” The notice also stated that “no employee, agent or inspector of the FDA shall be permitted on these premises.” His clinic used quack electrodiagnostic devices. The FDA raided his clinic and confiscated the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we shouldn’t judge others by the company they keep. Let’s look at whether the conference offers good science.&lt;br&gt;
There are two bonus electives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is a prolotherapy workshop. Prolotherapy is a controversial treatment not covered by insurance; &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004059.html"&gt;a Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;said there is conflicting evidence and found that prolotherapy injections were not superior to placebo injections, and that their effectiveness depended on co-interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is on LDA Immunotherapy – Ultra Low Dose Enzyme Activated Immunotherapy (formerly known as EPD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to treat complex inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and allergies, including asthma, eczema, IBS, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, interstitial cystitis and a multitude of others disorders with a definitive immunotherapy given only once every two months. LDA requires no testing and you can start it as soon as you get home!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some preliminary evidence that seems to support enzyme activated immunotherapy, there is also &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12896934?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=2"&gt;evidence that doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;. There is certainly nowhere near enough evidence for them to make the statement they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other questionable things on the agenda included sauna therapy for the management of toxicity and stool antibody testing for gluten sensitivity. None of the listings for sauna on PubMed have anything to do with toxicity. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16377644?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=4"&gt;This study &lt;/a&gt;showed that stool testing was not suitable for screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental medicine patients are told that the world has made them sick. They blame their symptoms on everything from cell phones to the very walls of their houses, from air pollution to food additives. The theory is that while one chemical might not be a problem, many different chemicals and substances overwhelm their ability to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental Medicine involves the adverse reactions experienced by an individual on exposure to an environmental excitant. Excitants to which individual susceptibility exists are found in air, food, water, and drugs, and are frequently found in the home, work, school, and play environments. Exposures to these agents may adversely affect one or more organ system and this effect is commonly not recognized by individuals and their physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their practice guidelines are explained &lt;a href="http://www.aaemonline.org/practiceguidelines.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the diagnostic tests they recommend are questionable. Treatment includes avoidance, immunotherapy, nutritional supplements, detoxification, restricted diets, and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poster boy for environmental medicine is Dr. William Rea, who was &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gx4zxxi0xQ"&gt;profiled on “Nightline”&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. They interviewed Rea and toured his clinic, seeing the detoxification saunas, the ceramic walls chosen because they are nonreactive, and the exercise machines that were cleaned of the lubricants that were putting fumes into the air. He claimed to have successfully treated 30,000 patients. They asked him about allegations that he had injected jet fuel into patients, and he explained that he only injected jet fuel antigens as a skin test for allergy. They asked him where his research was published and he evaded a direct answer, saying things like “&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is a drug company journal.” (!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They interviewed one of his patients: a medical doctor who first thought she was depressed and saw a psychiatrist every day for a year. She had to stop because driving there exposed her to diesel fumes on the highway. Dr. Rea figured out what was “really” wrong with her: she was sensitive to practically everything in the environment. She can’t use her telephone because the magnets in it give her a headache. She injects herself daily with all kinds of unconventional allergy shots. She even injects herself with mercury. She moved to an island and created a pollutant free home. She spends 2 hours a day inhaling oxygen. Curiously, she has no sensitivities to her dogs, her horses, or the dust kicked up as she rides in a dirt arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They interviewed a real allergy specialist who explains that these people are reacting to stress and they have developed a conditioned response so that they have symptoms when they smell something they think they’re sensitive to. He says most of these patients have an underlying psychiatric problem. I suspect one of the reasons they improve is that they now have a mission and their attempts to avoid exposures and the effort required to detoxify and treat themselves takes up most of their time, keeps them entertained, and distracts them from dwelling on their psychological issues. But as was pointed out on Nightline, they are not cured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/rea/complaint.shtml"&gt;As described on the Casewatch website&lt;/a&gt;, Rea is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; facing disciplinary action that could lead to revocation of his medical license. The Medical Board of Texas has charged him with (a) using pseudoscientific test methods, (b) failing to make accurate diagnoses, (c) providing “nonsensical” treatments, (d) failing to properly inform patients that his approach is unproven; (e) practicing in areas for which he has not been trained; and (f) representing himself certified by a board that is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. Rea is best known for his promotion of the concept of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), a diagnosis not recognized by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAEM was so upset with ABC that it felt compelled to publish &lt;a href="http://www.aaemonline.org/images/abcresponse.pdf"&gt;this defense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how rigorous a scientist Rea is, here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19854821?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=1"&gt;most recent example &lt;/a&gt;of his published scientific studies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight incapacitated individuals (average 43 years old, 7 males, 21 females, range 12-70) exposed to molds and mycotoxins were studied and treated with a protocol of cleaning up or changing their environment to be mold free. Injections of the optimum dose of antigens were given as part of the treatment protocol as was oral and intravenous (i.v.) antioxidants; heat depuration (sauna); physical therapy with massage and exercise under environmentally controlled conditions; oxygen therapy at 4-8 L/min for 2 hours with a special wood-grade cellophane reservoir and a glass oxygen container. Many patients were sensitive to plastics; therefore, exposures to these were kept to a minimum. Autogenous lymphocytic factor was given as an immune modulator. Of 28 patients, 27 did well and returned to work. One patient improved but did not return to work during the period of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no controls and multiple interventions it is impossible to determine what worked or if anything actually did. Or even what was wrong with these patients in the first place. They are not trying to falsify a hypothesis or learn anything new; they are trying to justify a belief system. In my opinion, this kind of study amounts to junk science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying message of environmental medicine seems to be “The modern world is a dangerous place: technology and chemicals are bad; everything in the environment is out to get you, even your food.” The AAEM website has position statements against mercury in vaccines, GMO foods, and toxic molds. And against the FDA’s attempts to regulate bioidentical hormones. Their statement on multiple chemical sensitivity can be read &lt;a href="http://www.aaemonline.org/chemicalsensitivitypost.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  An excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very sobering is the reality that certain man-made chemicals, like pesticides, were specifically designed to kill living things by poisoning their nervous systems. It should be no surprise that they wreak havoc on the brains of humans as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common incitants include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Those substances widely recognized as toxic, e.g., the aforementioned pesticides; natural gas; petroleum-based solvents like toluene and benzene; volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like formaldehyde; heavy metals like mercury and aluminum; molds and the potentially dangerous mycotoxins they release; tobacco smoke; the phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting compounds, like bisphenol A, found in plastics; flame retardants like PBDEs; and automobile exhaust fumes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Those substances less often recognized as toxic, e.g., synthetic fragrances like perfumes, air fresheners, and other “pleasant-scented” products; newspaper print; personal care products; laundry detergents and fabric softeners; household cleaners; and fluoride-containing water and toothpaste; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; More generally, the many pollutants found in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being afraid of everything in your environment from your toothpaste to newspaper print. The lives of these people are totally disrupted. They are afraid to leave home. One woman “hung her mail on a clothesline for weeks before reading it, to allow the “toxins” in the ink to dissipate.” &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mcs.html"&gt;Quackwatch calls MCS a spurious diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. MCS has not been meaningfully defined, diagnosis is based on unblinded, unvalidated tests whose findings vanish when blinding is used, and the treatment is everything but the kitchen sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Board of Medical Specialties was wise not to recognize environmental medicine as a legitimate specialty. It appears to have more in common with quackery than with science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental medicine is not your average specialty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a clear link between living to 100 and inheriting a hyperactive version of an enzyme that prevents cells from ageing, researchers say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the US say centenarian Ashkenazi Jews have this mutant gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that 86 very old people and their children had higher levels of telomerase which protects the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it may be possible to produce drugs that stimulate the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the linguistic functions in humans are controlled by the left cerebral hemisphere. A study of captive chimpanzees at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (Atlanta, Georgia), reported in the January 2010 issue of Elsevier’s &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that this “hemispheric lateralization” for language may have its evolutionary roots in the gestural communication of our common ancestors. A large majority of the chimpanzees in the study showed a significant bias towards right-handed gestures when communicating, which may reflect a similar dominance of the left hemisphere for communication in chimpanzees as that seen for language functions in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because they are my favorite religion ever. They illustrate what is wrong with religion perfectly and get called lunatics by mainstream religious folks despite the fact that they share nearly identical positions. The only difference between Pat Robertson and the WBC is that says gays are evil on TV before an audience of millions while the WBC has to get creative in order to get their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

- Eric Bogle: The Green Fields of France (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huRwBFmAx78"&gt;Dropkick Murphys Version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Apart from “The Great War of 2077” that brought about the collapse of the (fictional) Fallout-universe, there is only one War that is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War_(disambiguation)%E2%80%9D"&gt;“Great”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
To this day, 71 years after the end of hostilities, the First World War still holds a special place in the European Consciousness. The name was already coined during the hostilities, based partly on the enormous casualties, but also on the impression in 1914/15 that it would be “The War that will End War'” &lt;em&gt;(H. G. Wells in 1915)&lt;/em&gt; no matter how high the price of victory would be. The then-popularity of the war can in large part be explained by a successful propaganda effort initiated by the British government to legitimate the use of force against Germany. That the effects of this effort can still be felt today is a powerful testimonial to the effectiveness of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda%E2%80%9D"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;. But if the reasons given for Britain's entry into the war on the side of France and Russia were propaganda, what were the real reasons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will first introduce to the trigger and cause célèbre of much of the British propaganda: How and why Germany settled on the Schlieffen-Plan that ultimately not only failed to assure its military goal (the anticipated quick victory against France) but also, because of the violation of neutral Belgium, handed Britain the excuse to join the war on the French side on a silver platter. After that, the real motivation for the British government to enter the fight against the Germans will be explained.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“A Plan for Quick Victory in a Short War” &lt;em&gt;[2]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan%E2%80%9D"&gt;The Schlieffen Plan&lt;/a&gt; as the Beginning of the First World War in the West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great War was thoroughly planned. The German Army had a plan, perhaps the most famous plan in military history since the Trojan horse. The French Army had lots of plans, but had finally settled on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_XVII%E2%80%9D"&gt;Plan XVII&lt;/a&gt;. Even the British army had a plan. The Royal Navy pretended to have a plan. The British government had no plan at all, but thought it prudent to adopt one. The plan which the government adopted was that of the British army. This has been the cause of much dispute and recrimination and many have seen in it the seeds of all future disasters. &lt;em&gt;[3]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire%E2%80%9D"&gt;Imperial Germany's&lt;/a&gt; military policy had long been determined by the potentiality of a two-front war against both France and Britain on a western front and against Russia on an eastern front. This made it necessary to formulate a strategy that, by utilising the well-developed German railway system, allowed to first achieve victory against one opponent and then against the other. The first plan to incorporate this strategy was developed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Schlieffen%E2%80%9D"&gt;Field Marshal Alfred Graf von Schlieffen&lt;/a&gt; (Chief of the Great German General Staff from 1891 to 1906) from 1892 onwards and finished in 1905. Finally, it was adapted and significantly altered by his successor, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger%E2%80%9D"&gt;Helmuth von Moltke&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[4]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan called for the first assault to take place in the west, against the French and via Belgian territory. This decision for the western front and Belgium as the initial theatre of war was taken under the impression of two separate considerations: First of all, France would need a much shorter time to mobilise its army from peacetime levels to readiness for war, a feat that Russia (because of her vast distances and her inferior railway system) would not likely be able to accomplish. This, it was thought, would allow German troops enough time to first defeat France in a short, decisive campaign before transferring them to the east. Secondly, the war against Russia was thought to last longer than the one against France, as Russia had access to superior numbers of soldiers compared to all other powers in Europe. Belgium then was chosen as the corridor for the German army as it would allow the bulk of the German troops to bypass the strong French &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Schlieffen_Plan.jpg%E2%80%9D"&gt;border fortresses along the Moselle and Meuse rivers as well as the inaccessible Ardennes woodlands, completing a wheeling movement throughout northern France and capturing Paris within 42 days from mobilisation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[5]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But the Schlieffen-Plan contained several crucial flaws, militarily as well as politically. From a military-strategic point of view, the plan overestimated the possible speed of advance, mostly because it discounted the resistance by Belgians and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)%E2%80%9D"&gt;British Expeditionary Forces (BEF)&lt;/a&gt;. The latter in particular was ignored because there existed no official treaty between Belgium and Britain and no official commitment had been made by the British government to either Belgium or France (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_Cordiale_of_1904%E2%80%9D"&gt;Anglo-French Entente of 1904&lt;/a&gt; was primarily concerned with colonial matters). Unknown to the German military planners was the informal cooperation between the French and British Armies (motivated in part by the Moroccan crises of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Moroccan_Crisis%E2%80%9D"&gt;1905&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir_Crisis%E2%80%9D"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt;). Admittedly, there was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London,_1839%E2%80%9D"&gt;1839 Treaty of Londony&lt;/a&gt; by which Britain, Prussia and France guaranteed Belgium's neutrality, but by 1914 it had been “almost forgotten” &lt;em&gt;[6]&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless was this treaty cited by the British government after the commitment to war &lt;em&gt;[7]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schlieffen-Plan also severely underestimated the logistical problems of advancing more than 300,000 men mostly on foot &lt;em&gt;[8]&lt;/em&gt; across few and deficient Belgian roads. Not only did the decision by von Moltke to weaken the right wing of his troops in favour of the left make it less likely to close in on large parts of the French army, but the area itself made it physically impossible to complete the plan von Schlieffen had in mind, namely advancing on and capturing Paris – German troops could either advance with sufficient speed or in sufficient force, but not both &lt;em&gt;[9]&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from these issues in the west, Russia's faster-than-thought mobilisation also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gumbinnen%E2%80%9D"&gt;made for challenges in the east&lt;/a&gt; for Germany's Army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political entanglement was even more disastrous for Germany and “must rank as one of the worst political miscalculations of the century” &lt;em&gt;[10]&lt;/em&gt;: The violation of Belgian territory allowed the British government to assume the moral high ground and “the enormous advantage of being able to enter a war in the role of selfless guardian of European treaties” &lt;em&gt;[11]&lt;/em&gt;. This alleged protection of a small neutral country was quickly expanded into the official goals of British policy: Firstly, the war was conducted to defend or liberate several smaller countries (especially Belgium and Serbia) from an unjust foreign rule, thereby propagating the same national self-determination &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson%E2%80%9D"&gt;President Wilson&lt;/a&gt; later included into his famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points%E2%80%9D"&gt;“14 points”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[12]&lt;/em&gt;. The seemingly biggest adversary for this, (Prussian) militarism, would be ended once and for all. And, while doing so, democratic governments would be installed in the defeated states to prevent any future aggressions. Britain itself, it was said, would not profit in the least from its selfless involvement in the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sentiments were picked up quickly by the press: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Germany tried to bribe us with peace to desert our friends and duty. But Great Britain has  preferred the path of honour.”  - Daily Mirror, Aug 4, 1914 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going into a war that is forced upon us as the defender of the weak and the    champions of the liberties of Europe.” - The Times, Aug 5, 1914&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, in effect, the &lt;a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10090%E2%80%9D"&gt;violation of Belgium's neutrality (and the approximately 5,500 civilian casualties)&lt;/a&gt; permanently stigmatised Germany as the aggressor&lt;em&gt;[13]&lt;/em&gt; and gave the British government (as well as, later on, the USA) the excuse it needed to join the French/Belgian side. In other words, “Britain could go to war for France and appear to do so for Belgium” &lt;em&gt;[14]&lt;/em&gt;, while the British public showed “an impressive display of national unity” &lt;em&gt;[15]&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“What about India and the Mediterranean?” &lt;em&gt;[16]&lt;/em&gt; - British Motivation for Entering the War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Britain needed a moral justification for entering the war. This, she found in the German invasion of Belgium, and propaganda was employed to spread it far and wide, so that even “[t]rade unionists responded to Lord Kitchener's call to arms in overwhelming numbers [and units] were formed consisting almost entirely of miners or railwaymen or dockers”[17]. But all of these reasons given above are easily dismissed when scrutinised: “British intervention”, writes Bourne, “[was not] the result of a disinterested attachment to principles of natural justice and international law” &lt;em&gt;[18]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-determination of smaller nations could hardly be of importance to Britain when she still had numerous colonies as well as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Rule_Act_1914%E2%80%9D"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; under her rule. Furthermore, some small nations (e.g. Poland), territories (e.g. the Saar, Alsace-Lorraine, South Tirol) and colonies (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao#German_colonial_period_and_Japanese_occupation%E2%80%9D"&gt;the German possessions in China&lt;/a&gt;) were later used as leverage in secret treaties with other countries in order to lure them on the Allied side &lt;em&gt;[19]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the paradox between the aim of spreading democracy and the inclusion of Tsarist Russia in the Allied Forces should have been obvious from the beginning. Ultimately, even the claim of setting an end to militarism is, in retrospect, weak, since military spending by the main European powers not only continued, but actually soared during the inter-war period &lt;em&gt;[20]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But if all these moral justifications were untrue, what made the British government give up its policy of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendid_isolation%E2%80%9D"&gt;'Splendid Isolation'&lt;/a&gt; for good and enter into the war against Germany on France's side? The real motivation for this had little to do with honouring European treaties or standing by Britain's “friends and duty”, on the contrary. It was the result of pure power politics to safeguard British interests in Europe and the Far East:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Should the war come and England stand aside on of two things must happen: Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia [...]. [But then] what will be the position of friendless England?&lt;br&gt;
“Or France and Russia win. What would then be their attitude towards England? What    about India and the Mediterranean?” - Sir Eyre Crowe, July 23, 1914 &lt;em&gt;[21]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This brief note by Sir Eyre Crowe (a staunch anti-German serving in the Foreign Office) elucidates the British position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had no choice but to support France and Russia to maintain her own (colonial) interests. A victorious Russia, ungrateful towards a neutral Britain, would pose a potential threat to the British colonies in the Far East, especially India (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game%E2%80%9D"&gt;Russian Turkistan had a common border with Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;). An ungrateful France would pose an even greater threat towards British pursuit of hegemony. Not only the continent, but also the Mediterranean, as well as Britain&amp;#39;s interests in Africa and further towards the east (&amp;lt;a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal#Construction_by_Suez_Canal_Company”France already controlled a majority of shares of the Suez Canal) would be threatened by a hostile France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Germany successful in defeating all other continental great powers, on the other hand, further vitalised by its newly-gained access to the vast resources of Russia, would make it impossible for an isolated Britain to oppose it effectively &lt;em&gt;[22]&lt;/em&gt;. The decision to go to war, therefore, was only consequential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[But] German violation of Belgian neutrality allowed Sir Edward Grey [(the Foreign Secretary at the outbreak of hostilities)] to cloak British foreign policy in an aura of moral respectability […] [and portray the decision for war] as a principled stand against unprovoked German aggression in defence of international obligations and the rights of small nations. [...] Britain could go to war for France and appear to do so for Belgium” &lt;em&gt;[23]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part II of this post will take a deeper look at the British propaganda effort during the First World War, its sources, addressees and goals, as well as the organisations founded for that purpose, and major themes and topics that were exploited. I will also try and find the time to take a look at the results of the anti-German propaganda, both in a short-term and in a long-term perspective&lt;br&gt;

Do all those who lie here know why they died?&lt;br&gt;
Did you really believe them when they told you "The Cause?"&lt;br&gt;
Did you really believe that this war would end wars?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Eric Bogle: The Green Fields of France (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huRwBFmAx78"&gt;Dropkick Murphys Version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Apart from “The Great War of 2077” that brought about the collapse of the (fictional) Fallout-universe, there is only one War that is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War_(disambiguation)"&gt;“Great”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
To this day, 71 years after the end of hostilities, the First World War still holds a special place in the European Consciousness. The name was already coined during the hostilities, based partly on the enormous casualties, but also on the impression in 1914/15 that it would be “The War that will End War'” &lt;em&gt;(H. G. Wells in 1915)&lt;/em&gt; no matter how high the price of victory would be. The then-popularity of the war can in large part be explained by a successful propaganda effort initiated by the British government to legitimate the use of force against Germany. That the effects of this effort can still be felt today is a powerful testimonial to the effectiveness of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;. But if the reasons given for Britain's entry into the war on the side of France and Russia were propaganda, what were the real reasons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will first introduce to the trigger and cause célèbre of much of the British propaganda: How and why Germany settled on the Schlieffen-Plan that ultimately not only failed to assure its military goal (the anticipated quick victory against France) but also, because of the violation of neutral Belgium, handed Britain the excuse to join the war on the French side on a silver platter. After that, the real motivation for the British government to enter the fight against the Germans will be explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/Schlieffenplan_0.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“A Plan for Quick Victory in a Short War” &lt;em&gt;[2]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan"&gt;The Schlieffen Plan&lt;/a&gt; as the Beginning of the First World War in the West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great War was thoroughly planned. The German Army had a plan, perhaps the most famous plan in military history since the Trojan horse. The French Army had lots of plans, but had finally settled on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_XVII"&gt;Plan XVII&lt;/a&gt;. Even the British army had a plan. The Royal Navy pretended to have a plan. The British government had no plan at all, but thought it prudent to adopt one. The plan which the government adopted was that of the British army. This has been the cause of much dispute and recrimination and many have seen in it the seeds of all future disasters. &lt;em&gt;[3]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire"&gt;Imperial Germany's&lt;/a&gt; military policy had long been determined by the potentiality of a two-front war against both France and Britain on a western front and against Russia on an eastern front. This made it necessary to formulate a strategy that, by utilising the well-developed German railway system, allowed to first achieve victory against one opponent and then against the other. The first plan to incorporate this strategy was developed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Schlieffen"&gt;Field Marshal Alfred Graf von Schlieffen&lt;/a&gt; (Chief of the Great German General Staff from 1891 to 1906) from 1892 onwards and finished in 1905. Finally, it was adapted and significantly altered by his successor, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger"&gt;Helmuth von Moltke&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[4]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan called for the first assault to take place in the west, against the French and via Belgian territory. This decision for the western front and Belgium as the initial theatre of war was taken under the impression of two separate considerations: First of all, France would need a much shorter time to mobilise its army from peacetime levels to readiness for war, a feat that Russia (because of her vast distances and her inferior railway system) would not likely be able to accomplish. This, it was thought, would allow German troops enough time to first defeat France in a short, decisive campaign before transferring them to the east. Secondly, the war against Russia was thought to last longer than the one against France, as Russia had access to superior numbers of soldiers compared to all other powers in Europe. Belgium then was chosen as the corridor for the German army as it would allow the bulk of the German troops to bypass the strong French &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Schlieffen_Plan.jpg"&gt;border fortresses along the Moselle and Meuse rivers as well as the inaccessible Ardennes woodlands, completing a wheeling movement throughout northern France and capturing Paris within 42 days from mobilisation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[5]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But the Schlieffen-Plan contained several crucial flaws, militarily as well as politically. From a military-strategic point of view, the plan overestimated the possible speed of advance, mostly because it discounted the resistance by Belgians and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)"&gt;British Expeditionary Forces (BEF)&lt;/a&gt;. The latter in particular was ignored because there existed no official treaty between Belgium and Britain and no official commitment had been made by the British government to either Belgium or France (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_Cordiale_of_1904"&gt;Anglo-French Entente of 1904&lt;/a&gt; was primarily concerned with colonial matters). Unknown to the German military planners was the informal cooperation between the French and British Armies (motivated in part by the Moroccan crises of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Moroccan_Crisis"&gt;1905&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir_Crisis"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt;). Admittedly, there was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London,_1839"&gt;1839 Treaty of Londony&lt;/a&gt; by which Britain, Prussia and France guaranteed Belgium's neutrality, but by 1914 it had been “almost forgotten” &lt;em&gt;[6]&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless was this treaty cited by the British government after the commitment to war &lt;em&gt;[7]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schlieffen-Plan also severely underestimated the logistical problems of advancing more than 300,000 men mostly on foot &lt;em&gt;[8]&lt;/em&gt; across few and deficient Belgian roads. Not only did the decision by von Moltke to weaken the right wing of his troops in favour of the left make it less likely to close in on large parts of the French army, but the area itself made it physically impossible to complete the plan von Schlieffen had in mind, namely advancing on and capturing Paris – German troops could either advance with sufficient speed or in sufficient force, but not both &lt;em&gt;[9]&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from these issues in the west, Russia's faster-than-thought mobilisation also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gumbinnen"&gt;made for challenges in the east&lt;/a&gt; for Germany's Army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political entanglement was even more disastrous for Germany and “must rank as one of the worst political miscalculations of the century” &lt;em&gt;[10]&lt;/em&gt;: The violation of Belgian territory allowed the British government to assume the moral high ground and “the enormous advantage of being able to enter a war in the role of selfless guardian of European treaties” &lt;em&gt;[11]&lt;/em&gt;. This alleged protection of a small neutral country was quickly expanded into the official goals of British policy: Firstly, the war was conducted to defend or liberate several smaller countries (especially Belgium and Serbia) from an unjust foreign rule, thereby propagating the same national self-determination &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"&gt;President Wilson&lt;/a&gt; later included into his famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points"&gt;“14 points”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[12]&lt;/em&gt;. The seemingly biggest adversary for this, (Prussian) militarism, would be ended once and for all. And, while doing so, democratic governments would be installed in the defeated states to prevent any future aggressions. Britain itself, it was said, would not profit in the least from its selfless involvement in the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sentiments were picked up quickly by the press: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Germany tried to bribe us with peace to desert our friends and duty. But Great Britain has  preferred the path of honour.”  - Daily Mirror, Aug 4, 1914 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going into a war that is forced upon us as the defender of the weak and the    champions of the liberties of Europe.” - The Times, Aug 5, 1914&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, in effect, the &lt;a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10090"&gt;violation of Belgium's neutrality (and the approximately 5,500 civilian casualties)&lt;/a&gt; permanently stigmatised Germany as the aggressor&lt;em&gt;[13]&lt;/em&gt; and gave the British government (as well as, later on, the USA) the excuse it needed to join the French/Belgian side. In other words, “Britain could go to war for France and appear to do so for Belgium” &lt;em&gt;[14]&lt;/em&gt;, while the British public showed “an impressive display of national unity” &lt;em&gt;[15]&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“What about India and the Mediterranean?” &lt;em&gt;[16]&lt;/em&gt; - British Motivation for Entering the War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Britain needed a moral justification for entering the war. This, she found in the German invasion of Belgium, and propaganda was employed to spread it far and wide, so that even “[t]rade unionists responded to Lord Kitchener's call to arms in overwhelming numbers [and units] were formed consisting almost entirely of miners or railwaymen or dockers”[17]. But all of these reasons given above are easily dismissed when scrutinised: “British intervention”, writes Bourne, “[was not] the result of a disinterested attachment to principles of natural justice and international law” &lt;em&gt;[18]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-determination of smaller nations could hardly be of importance to Britain when she still had numerous colonies as well as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Rule_Act_1914"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; under her rule. Furthermore, some small nations (e.g. Poland), territories (e.g. the Saar, Alsace-Lorraine, South Tirol) and colonies (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao#German_colonial_period_and_Japanese_occupation"&gt;the German possessions in China&lt;/a&gt;) were later used as leverage in secret treaties with other countries in order to lure them on the Allied side &lt;em&gt;[19]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the paradox between the aim of spreading democracy and the inclusion of Tsarist Russia in the Allied Forces should have been obvious from the beginning. Ultimately, even the claim of setting an end to militarism is, in retrospect, weak, since military spending by the main European powers not only continued, but actually soared during the inter-war period &lt;em&gt;[20]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But if all these moral justifications were untrue, what made the British government give up its policy of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendid_isolation"&gt;'Splendid Isolation'&lt;/a&gt; for good and enter into the war against Germany on France's side? The real motivation for this had little to do with honouring European treaties or standing by Britain's “friends and duty”, on the contrary. It was the result of pure power politics to safeguard British interests in Europe and the Far East:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Should the war come and England stand aside on of two things must happen: Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia [...]. [But then] what will be the position of friendless England?&lt;br&gt;
“Or France and Russia win. What would then be their attitude towards England? What    about India and the Mediterranean?” - Sir Eyre Crowe, July 23, 1914 &lt;em&gt;[21]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This brief note by Sir Eyre Crowe (a staunch anti-German serving in the Foreign Office) elucidates the British position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had no choice but to support France and Russia to maintain her own (colonial) interests. A victorious Russia, ungrateful towards a neutral Britain, would pose a potential threat to the British colonies in the Far East, especially India (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game"&gt;Russian Turkistan had a common border with Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;). An ungrateful France would pose an even greater threat towards British pursuit of hegemony. Not only the continent, but also the Mediterranean, as well as Britain's interests in Africa and further towards the east (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal#Construction_by_Suez_Canal_Company"&gt;France already controlled a majority of shares of the Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;) would be threatened by a hostile France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Germany successful in defeating all other continental great powers, on the other hand, further vitalised by its newly-gained access to the vast resources of Russia, would make it impossible for an isolated Britain to oppose it effectively &lt;em&gt;[22]&lt;/em&gt;. The decision to go to war, therefore, was only consequential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[But] German violation of Belgian neutrality allowed Sir Edward Grey [(the Foreign Secretary at the outbreak of hostilities)] to cloak British foreign policy in an aura of moral respectability […] [and portray the decision for war] as a principled stand against unprovoked German aggression in defence of international obligations and the rights of small nations. [...] Britain could go to war for France and appear to do so for Belgium” &lt;em&gt;[23]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part II of this post will take a deeper look at the British propaganda effort during the First World War, its sources, addressees and goals, as well as the organisations founded for that purpose, and major themes and topics that were exploited. I will also try and find the time to take a look at the results of the anti-German propaganda, both in a short-term and in a long-term perspective&lt;br&gt;

Check his post out as well if you haven't already.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(extra edit add-on: geez, Steve Novella also beats up Maher &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1238#more-1238"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Neither of these guys use the word "motherfucker", however, so you still need to read my post.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill Maher wrote recently at the Huffington Post an article entitled, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-maher/vaccination-a-conversatio_b_358578.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vaccination: A Conversation Worth Having&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It is, in part, a response to the &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/articles/4465"&gt;open letter written to him by Michael Shermer&lt;/a&gt; and goes a bit deeper into his reasons for being against "western" medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found Maher's article to be painful, much like the way it is painful to put a spoon in a crappy gas-station cup of coffee.  You bring the cup to your lips to sip and BAM! the ol' spoon handle in the fuckin' eyeball.  The coffee was going to suck anyway, but the spoon just added that extra level of suckatude that wasn't needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the stupid begins...&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel like I've become a confessor for people who want someone to be raising questions about vaccines.  But I don't want the job. I agree with my critics who say there are far more qualified people than me -- its just that mainstream media rarely interviews doctors and scientists who present an alternative point of view. There is a movement to stop people from asking any questions about vaccines -- they're a miracle, that's it, debate over.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bullshit, plain and simple.  The only doctors or medical professionals I ever see interviewed on the mainstream media shows are ones with "alternative" views.  The media &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; "maverick" doctors who buck the mainstream and tout some implausible "cure".  Just look around at most of the famous health spokespeople: Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil, fucking Suzanne Somers, motherfucking Jenny McCarthy, and Dr. Christiane Northrup.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, there are some good ones (Dr. Drew Pinsky and Dr. Sanjay Gupta come to mind), but overall if you see an MD or "health spokesperson" on TV, it's going to be a whackjob.&lt;blockquote&gt;The British Medical Journal from August 25 says half the doctors and medical workers in the U.K. are not taking the flu shot -- are they all crazy too? Sixty-five percent of French people don't want it. Maybe its not as simple as the medical establishment wants to paint it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, the only thing I could find on the 'net saying something like this was &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/19117227/British-Medical-Journal-Half-of-Health-Workers-Reject-H1N1-Vaccine"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; saying that the BMJ made public research from Hong Kong saying that half of the health care workers there &lt;i&gt;(in Honk Kong)&lt;/i&gt; were going to refuse the H1N1 vaccine.  It seems in Britain, there is less panic and things are &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/12/eveningnews/main5633412.shtml"&gt;going quite smoothly, thank you&lt;/a&gt;.  I loved this line in particular:  &lt;i&gt;"For every one vaccine dose in the U.S. there are four in the UK. Additives are not used in the U.S. because Americans worry about their safety."&lt;/i&gt;  Yes, worry away, my pretties, worry away....&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel its unnecessary and counterproductive to try and silence people with condescension. Michael Shermer wrote me an open letter and felt I needed to be told that "vaccinations work by tricking the body's immune system into thinking that it has already had the disease for which the vaccination was given." Thanks, Doc, I thought there might be a little man inside the needle. Yes, I read Microbe Hunters when I was eight, I have a basic idea how vaccines work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Really, Bill?  You said recently that the swine flu vaccine has crazy stuff like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSg6lG3cvTE&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt; in it.  You said that we shouldn't believe you and that we should check the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/"&gt;CDC's website&lt;/a&gt; for ourselves (go ahead, try to find "insect repellent" anywhere on there).  Well, luckily for us, a stalwart defender of science-based medicine did just that.  He did some poking around and...well, I'll let &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/the_2009_recipient_of_the_richard_dawkin_1.php"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; tell it himself:&lt;blockquote&gt;I will admit that the "insect repellent" gambit is a new one on me. I looked at the CDC list of vaccine ingredients and couldn't find anything resembling a pesticide or insect repellant chemical. I may not know enough to have identified it; so I did a bit of digging. Guess where I found this one? Really, take a guess? Surprise, surprise! I found it on the uber conspiracy website Rense.com, which complains about the adjuvant MF59, stating that it is made up of Tween 80, squalene, and Span85, about the last of which it says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;i&gt;Span85: Patented by the now defunct Chiron (bought by Novartis). Its chemical name is Sorbitan Trioleate. It is an oily liquid used in medicine, textiles, cosmetics, and paints as an emulsifier, anti-rust agent, and thickener. [Some factories in China specialize only in manufacturing Tween 80 and Span 85.] According to the Pesticide Action Network North America [PANNA], this chemical is used as a pesticide. It is also used as an adjuvant and is "toxic to humans, including carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, and acute toxicity."(16)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...MF59 has been used in Europe for a dozen years without mishap. Basically, Maher's whine appears to be an even more ridiculous version of the "squalene gambit." Again, remember that the dose makes the poison. As is the case for aluminum, there is no good evidence that squalene or MF59 is harmful at the doses used in vaccines and plenty of evidence that it is safe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And just to be clear, there is no adjuvant in the U.S. vaccines, is there, Bill?  So you guys don't have to worry your pretty little organic-vegetable-eating heads at all.  Sure you have a "basic understanding", sure you do.  Much like how Deepak Chopra understands quantum mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maher goes on to mention that a &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/i&gt; reporter asked a question to the Secretary of Health and Human Services about his twitter post which said, &lt;i&gt;"If u get a swine flu shot, ur an idiot"&lt;/i&gt;.  Maher backpedals a bit here and admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;...so yes, some people are not idiotic to get a flu shot. They're idiotic if they don't investigate the pros and cons of getting a flu shot. But, come on -- it was a twitter from a comedian, not a treatise in the New England Journal of Medicine, that's not what I do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, but people who watch &lt;u&gt;Real Time&lt;/u&gt; or follow Maher on twitter are not morons and can tell the difference between a joke and an actual opinion.  Anyone who actually does &lt;i&gt;"investigate the pros and cons"&lt;/i&gt; of flu shots will come away with the opinion that they are worthwhile.  That's &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;IF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you honestly look at all aspects of the issue.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you only look at rense.com, whale.to, Natural News or Mercola, you'll get the conspiracy mongering that we've come to expect from anyone who refers to &lt;i&gt;"western medicine"&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;"allopathic medicine"&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;"boosting your natural immunity"&lt;/i&gt;.  (Pssst...I'm looking at you, Bill)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, here we go with the good stuff:&lt;blockquote&gt;I would have, for example, added to my discussion with Dr. Bill Frist on October 2 that, yes, any flu or health challenge can be dangerous when you're pregnant, and if your immune system is already compromised by, for example, eating a typical American diet, then a flu shot can make sense. But someone needs to be representing the point of view that says the preferred way to handle flus is to have a strong immune system to begin with, and getting lots of vaccines might not be the best way to accomplish that over the long haul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bill, we have to get back to your "basic understanding" of vaccines.  You don't have any sort of "basic understanding".  See, your immune system takes time to manufacture antibodies when it comes in contact with an influenza virus.  When talking about the swine flu, not many people have antibodies because, well, it's a new flu.  That's the whole point of the vaccine - no one has contacted this before, so no one is immune.  Lots and lots of people will get infected which equals sick time, hospital time, some deaths...  It doesn't matter how great your immune system is, if you're exposed and you inhale, you're getting it.  Yeah, even you, Superman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccines give you immunity without the hassle of getting barfy/shitty/horrible sick for two weeks, and there are no credible reasons to think there is any danger at all.  If you have that evidence, we'd love to see it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "toxin gambit":&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition, my audience is bright, they wouldn't refuse a flu shot because they heard me talk about it, but if they looked into the subject a little more, how is that a bad thing? If they went to the CDC Web site and saw what's in the vaccine -- the formaldehyde, the insect repellent, the mercury -- shouldn't they at least get to have the information for themselves?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jesus christ, Bill, really?  I'm not even going to tackle that one.  Seriously, go &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see Orac school the living hell out of both Jim "My Ass is Smarter than my Head" Carrey and Dr. Jay "I (heart) Jenny McCarthy" Gordon on the stupidity that is the "toxin gambit".&lt;blockquote&gt;Does the polio vaccine have the power to prevent children from getting polio, and did it indeed do just that in the 1950s? I believe it does, and it did. But polio had diminished by over 50 percent in the thirty years before the vaccine -- that's a pretty big fact in the polio story that you don't often hear and which merits debate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Diminished by over 50 percent?  Ummm, &lt;a href="http://www.post-polio.org/ir-usa.html"&gt;what?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So yes, I get it, we learned how to trick our immune systems. And maybe sometimes, you gotta do it. But maybe the immune system doesn't like being tricked so many times. Maybe we should be studying that instead of shouting down debate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, Bill, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez"&gt;they are studying that&lt;/a&gt;.  No one is "shouting down debate".  What's getting shouted down is people like you bringing up stupid shit like "insect repellent" and the &lt;i&gt;horrible toxins&lt;/i&gt; like aluminum and mercury!  Do some reading at a site that doesn't use six different-colored flashing fonts and maybe you'll come away with an understanding that's a bit less than basic.&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone who speaks eloquently about this is Barbara Loe Fisher&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh jesus christ, here we go...&lt;blockquote&gt;I find her extremely credible, as I do Dr. Russell Blaylock, Dr. Jay Gordon and many others, but I shouldn't have even mentioned them because I don't want to be "the Vaccine Guy"!! Look it up yourself, and stop asking me about it -- I'm already the Religion Guy, and that's enough work!&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you think these people are credible, then you're likely too far gone down the rabbit hole of stupid and the caterpillar with the awesome weed will keep you company for a long long time.&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyway, Ms. Fisher is someone who says she is not "anti-vaccine," but just has a lot of questions about the long term effect of using a lot of vaccines...She also points out "that what we need, but do not yet have, are studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated children."&lt;/blockquote&gt;I would like to point readers to Mark Crislip's excellent article &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2495"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where he talks, in part, about the ethics involved in trials like the one Mr. Fisher wants.  The relevant section teaser!&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be an interesting informed consent: a large number of studies suggests that the vaccine is protective for morbidity and mortality but we want to prove it with a placebo controlled trial. Are you going to sign up? And you have to ask: if the test proposed by Dr. Jefferson, a large trial of vaccine in the elderly (edit: or kids) with death as  an endpoint is accomplished and it shows that the elderly (edit: or kids) do have increased mortality if they are not vaccinated, which is strongly suggested by the preponderance of data we already have, what are you going to tell the next of kin of the dead? We were right, thanks for the sacrifice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So that happened....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to skip ahead in Maher's article here.  No reason other than he's getting to me and I've got other shit to do tonight apart from pointing out where Maher is being a retard.  You know, like eating fudge and compromising my immune system with a "western diet".&lt;blockquote&gt;...let's have a real debate about how much we should use vaccines and antibiotics. Of course it's good that we have them in our arsenal, but isn't the real skeptic the one who asks if these powerful but toxic methods do harm to what actually is a a very good defensive system, the one you were born with?&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, Bill, the "real skeptic" is the one who looks at &lt;i&gt;all aspects&lt;/i&gt; of the situation and evaluates all the evidence in as impartial a manner as possible.  You are clearly not doing this.  Look at the "very good defensive system" that most people were born with a hundred years ago and you'll find out pretty quickly that we're alive longer now and it's no thanks to our "natural immunity".  You would enjoy your all-natural bout with, and possible death from, pertussis while you just two weeks out of the ol' womb-with-a-view.&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it conspiracy theory to believe that American medicine too much treats symptoms and not root causes of disease? I always ask my friends when they go to the doctor for something, "Did your doctor ask you what you eat?" The answer is almost always 'no,' and a lot can be cured with diet and a healthier lifestyle. (And a lot can't. I also understand the role of genetics and generations of artificial selection). But Americans don't want to hear that, so doctors don't push it. It's easier and more profitable to write a prescription for Lipitor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You knew that was coming, right?  The "treats symptoms but not the cause" bullshit had to rear its head at some point.  Doctors tell people all the fucking time to put down the cheeseburgers, stretch a little bit, and for chrissake take a walk, Tons-o'-Fun.  Maher is correct that most people don't want to hear it, but the problem isn't that doctors don't say it, it's that patients fucking &lt;b&gt;ignore&lt;/b&gt; it.  We see it all the time in the physio clinic I work at.  Give clients exercises, they don't do them.  Give them stretches, they don't do them.  Suggest doing a nightly 20 minute walk and by the look on their face, you'd think you just told them their cock was hanging out.  In the face of patient non-cooperation, the best way to extend their life is to prescribe Lipitor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And by the way, I get pissed when people make the attack that "Big Pharma" makes billions (&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;billions!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) of dollars each year selling drugs.  Yes, they do.  They sell drugs to us, and not always in the most ethical of way, but as Crislip once said (this is from memory), &lt;i&gt;"the pharmaceutical companies have amazing scientists who develop phenomenal products that save lives, then they turn those products over to scumbag used car salesmen."&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to make a point, I think it would be safe to say that Jenny McCarthy is a millionaire.  She got that money by appearing on MTV, modeling while &lt;a href="http://images.doctissimo.fr/photo/hd/8151113815/private-category/20mccarthy-20toilet-20naked0-2180790284.jpg"&gt;sitting on a toilet&lt;/a&gt;, and acting in movies like &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800268/"&gt;Wieners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001562/"&gt;Witless Protection&lt;/a&gt;.

Who would you rather be compensated with millions of dollars? &lt;blockquote&gt;Ms. Fisher said "If we want to create a society that is dependent on shots for immunity -- the same way we are getting dependent on prescription drugs, antibiotics, and surgery -- this is the path we should keep going down."  I don't think its "anti-science" to pause and consider that point of view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is quite anti-critical-thinking to suggest that the population should give up vaccination or that there is a danger in getting a flu shot.  It is ridiculous to insinuate that we are creating a population, "dependent on shots for immunity" when far too few people get the flu shot to provide herd immunity.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In trying to defend himself, Maher drew out his sword and promptly cut off his foot.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091027/ap_on_sc/us_sci_global_cooling"&gt;Statisticians Confirm Reality of Global Warming in Blinded Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the claims making the rounds has been that, contrary to the consensus within the climate science community, the Earth is actually entering a period of global cooling – this claim is patently fallacious, and anyone who has a basic understanding of statistics knows it.  But what happened recently, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091027/ap_on_sc/us_sci_global_cooling"&gt;as reported in a widely-circulated AP &lt;/a&gt;story, really slams the door shut on this bogus claim: the temperature data for the planet was analyzed by a series of independent statisticians, all of whom found a warming (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a cooling) trend in the data.  And here’s the kicker: these statisticians didn’t know what the data were – in other words, &lt;em&gt;the examination of the Earth’s temperature data was a &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Double-Blind"&gt;blinded test&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard that the world is now cooling instead of warming? You may have seen some news reports on the Internet or heard about it from a provocative new book. Only one problem: It’s not true, according to an analysis of the numbers done by several independent statisticians for The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case that the Earth might be cooling partly stems from recent weather. Last year was cooler than previous years. It’s been a while since the super-hot years of 1998 and 2005. So is this a longer climate trend or just weather’s normal ups and downs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a blind test, the AP gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends, without telling them what the numbers represented. The experts found no true temperature declines over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a micro-trend within a bigger trend, that technique is particularly suspect,” said John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result puts paid to the oft-repeated claim by GW-deniers that there is a cooling trend in the data.  Of course, the only reason why these pseudoscientists were able to get away with their false claims for so long was because they, as professor Grego said, have been &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Cherry-Picking"&gt;cherry-picking the data&lt;/a&gt; and presenting it incomplete &amp;amp; out-of-context in order to give the impression that the Earth is cooling.  But, as we’ve seen, once the experimenter &amp;amp; statistician bias is removed from the analysis, which is the whole purpose of doing blinded tests, a very real and consistent warming trend is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets &lt;em&gt;even worse&lt;/em&gt; for the GW-deniers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Exhibit B:&lt;/strong&gt; An anti-GW petition &amp;amp; campaign “on behalf of” the &lt;a href="http://aps.org/"&gt;American Physical Society&lt;/a&gt; has been exposed as fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consensus+Explodes+APS+Opens+Global+Warming+Debate/article12403.htm"&gt;a widely circulated story in GW-denier circles&lt;/a&gt; claimed that a large portion of the membership of the American Physical Society (a professional organization for physicists of which I am a member) had signed onto a petition rebutting the scientific consensus on global warming, and – further – that the APS leadership itself had reversed its stance on the issue…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Physical Society, an organization representing nearly 50,000 physicists, has reversed its stance on climate change and is now proclaiming that many of its members disbelieve in human-induced &lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consensus+Explodes+APS+Opens+Global+Warming+Debate/article12403.htm#"&gt;global warming&lt;img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The APS is also sponsoring public debate on the validity of global warming science.  The leadership of the society had previously called the evidence for global warming “incontrovertible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/200807/editor.cfm"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; to the APS forum, editor Jeffrey Marque explains,”There is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the IPCC conclusion that anthropogenic &lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consensus+Explodes+APS+Opens+Global+Warming+Debate/article12403.htm#"&gt;CO2 emissions&lt;img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, my b.s. detector went practically off the scale, because the day after publication the APS had released a statement (on that same page!) that was directly contrary to the claims in this article…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 7/17/2008: After publication of this story, the APS responded with a statement that its Physics and Society Forum is merely one unit within the APS, and its views do not reflect those of the Society at large. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this annoying fact was pointed out to the deniers, many made claims about how there were “thousands” of physicists signing onto the petition claiming that GW-science was false – the implication being that the rank-and-file membership of the APS was revolting against the “establishment” (a variation on anti-scientific &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Conspiracy_Theory"&gt;conspiracy mongering&lt;/a&gt;).  At the time, my b.s. detector went off again, because such a claim smacked so strongly of similar claims made by &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationists&lt;/a&gt; that numerous scientists had &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Evolution_is_losing_support_among_scientists"&gt;“dissented from Darwinism”.&lt;/a&gt; Of course, such a claim is nothing more than an &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Popularity"&gt;argument from popularity&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s even worse than that – &lt;em&gt;it’s just a bald-faced lie, &lt;strong&gt;and it always has been!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because evidence &lt;em&gt;directly contradicting&lt;/em&gt; the GW-denier claims that the APS rank-and-file has revolted against the APS “establishment” on climate science has come to light:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/only-0-45-of-physicists-sign-denier-petition/"&gt;Only 0.45% of Physicists sign Denier Petition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite seven months of intense effort to recruit physicists to sign a politically motivated petition disputing anthropogenic climate change, a mere, &lt;strong&gt;0.45%&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.aps.org/"&gt;American Physical Society&lt;/a&gt;’s 47,000 members signed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a humiliating defeat for the climate change &lt;a href="http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/denier-vs-skeptic/"&gt;Deniers&lt;/a&gt; who make such false claims as ”many scientists dispute’ and ‘there is no consensus. The Petition drive was announced in the prestigous journal &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7254/full/460457b.html"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.aps.org/units/fhp/governance/minutes/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=179332"&gt;APS publications&lt;/a&gt;, numerous &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124597505076157449.html"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=APS+petition+%22climate+change%22&amp;amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enCA274CA281&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;electronic media&lt;/a&gt;, as well as heavily promoted by the petition organizers. Despite all of that effort and publicity, a mere &lt;strong&gt;0.45%&lt;/strong&gt; was all that they could manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that the success rate for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_fraud"&gt;Nigerian email scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is estimated to be&lt;strong&gt; 0.1% to 0.2%&lt;/strong&gt;, ie roughly speaking about the same. (Tip of the Hat to &lt;a href="http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/only-0-45-of-physicists-sign-denier-petition/#comment-5719"&gt;Grumbine &lt;/a&gt;for the genesis of seeking a comparison)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/11/physicists_firm_on_climate_cha.html"&gt;Physicists firm on climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40916"&gt;APS rejects plea to alter stance on climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://physicsfrontline.aps.org/2009/11/10/aps-council-overwhelmingly-rejects-proposal-to-replace-societys-current-climate-change-statement/"&gt;APS Council Overwhelmingly Rejects Proposal to Replace Society’s Current Climate Change Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the reason for that APS Council’s rejection is unrelated to the number of the signatories, but rather was based the quality of the alleged “science” justifying the call. &lt;a href="http://www.climatephysics.com/GlobalWarming/APS.htm"&gt;The “scientific” claims&lt;/a&gt; are a sad cobbling together of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skepdic.com/ignorance.html"&gt;argumentum ad ignorantiam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skepdic.com/authorty.html"&gt;appeal to authority&lt;/a&gt; logical fallacies, along with the unbelievably idiotic “&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/2009/08/06/climate-denier-opts-for-the-george-will-defense/"&gt;it’s happened in the past&lt;/a&gt;” argument. As “science” it should embarrass a freshman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**BTW, this graphic nicely illustrates the utter fail behind this stupid anti-scientific petition campaign…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/aps2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="aps2" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/aps2.jpg?w=210&amp;amp;h=679" alt="" width="210" height="679"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops – looks like the anti-GW science denialists got caught on this one with their pants down.  But that’s what happens in scientific circles if you make things up – whether it be the cold-fusion hoax, the global cooling myth, or lying about the number of legitimate physicists who agree with your pseudoscience – sooner or later the truth will catch up to you, and you’ll be revealed for what you really are… &lt;strong&gt;cynical, lying bastards with an ideological &amp;amp; political agenda.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a message to all you GW-deniers who’ve been pushing this crap over the last couple of years:&lt;/p&gt;

So far, as expected, the beneficial biochemical changes caused by CR in humans look very much like the biochemical changes observed in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. That bodes well for a gain in human life span as a result of this practice, though at the present level of available biotechnology there is little option but to wait and see what the results will be on that count. The consensus amongst biogerontologists appears to be that CR will extend human life span by a handful of percentage points, but practitioners of calorie restriction would be expected to evade or resist all of the common age-related diseases. Biologist Michael Rose, known for his work on aging in flies, is a calorie restriction (CR) skeptic, it would seem. He and John Phelan have developed a mathematical model that predicts a "lifetime of low-calorie dieting would only extend human life span by about 7 percent, unlike smaller animals, whose life spans are affected more by the effects of starvation. ...

I can't stand beer. I prefer liqueurs and on rare occasions, when the food paring is appropriate, I may have a glass of wine (although I generally don't keep any stocked in my personal liquor cabinet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I definitely have a few brands I prefer (the St. James peach wine can be very good, although it's not always consistent), but generally, if experimenting, I try to go by the ratings listed in the store. In general, these ratings have done very well for me. My absolute favorite brand of amaretto (Gozio) was one I discovered through its high rating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703683804574533840282653628.html"&gt;a recently published study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that the wine ratings (which is presumably done in the same manner as for the other liquors) may be substantially flawed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, the ratings had a large spread, even by the same taster. Most tasters rated the same wines within +/- 4 points, but some had deviations as large as +/- 10 points! And before you can claim that that is just due to the skill of the former tasters, the study also showed that the same ones were inconsistent from year to year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, the ratings aren't what they should be and there's so many wines clustered in the high 80's and 90's that such a substantial spread makes the system virtually worthless for a statistical standpoint. And the wine makers aren't surprised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, wine makers aren't ready to shuck the ratings all together. They still admit that the higher rating does give people a sort of placebo effect in which, having a high rating will make people perceive it as better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with this new information, I think I may try experimenting a bit more when I pick up wines and stick with ones that I've come to like, regardless of the rating.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-3474613152079094387?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258424191647"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/nobody_ever_said_the_war_on_dr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a78855319c07f91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Nobody ever said the war on drugs was going to be ... serious.</title><published>2009-11-17T01:28:08Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T01:28:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/uoOcsnNv4_g/nobody_ever_said_the_war_on_dr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/nobody_ever_said_the_war_on_dr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RQePa187Llc%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/nobody_ever_said_the_war_on_dr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/uoOcsnNv4_g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258422200707"><id gr:original-id="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/11/16/the-micro-black-hole-dilemma-revisited/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2148a7fac4ebd711</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">the micro black hole dilemma, revisited</title><published>2009-11-16T18:11:06Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T18:11:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/__XIZptlYmU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://worldofweirdthings.com/2009/11/16/the-micro-black-hole-dilemma-revisited/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Do you hear the rumble in the background?

I’d like to discuss this a bit further. The paper, by Chandras et. al, discusses how databases and, to use their term, Biological Resource Centers (BRCs) are to maintain financial viability.

Let me state first, I completely agree with their premise, that databases and resources have become imperative. The earlier model of “publication of experimental results and sharing of the reated research materials” needs to be extended. As they state:

It is however no longer adequate to share data through traditional modes of publication, and, particularly with high throughput (’-omics) technologies, sharing of datasets requires submission to public databases as has long been the case with nucleic acid and protein sequence data.

The authors state, factually, that the financial model for most biological databases (we are talking the thousands that exist), has often been a 3-5 year development funding, that once runs out, the infrastructure needs to be supported by another source. In fact, this has lead to the defunding of databases such as TAIR and VBRC (and many others), excellent resources with irreplaceable data and tools, that then must struggle to find funding to maintain the considerable costs of funding infrastructure and continued development.

The demands of scientific research, open, shared data, require a funding model that maintains the publicly available nature of these databases. And thus the problem as they state:

If, for financial reasons, BRCs are unable to perform their tasks under conditions that meet the requirements of sceintfic research and the deamnds of industry, scientists will either see valuable information lost or being transferred into strictly commercial environment with at east two consequences: (i) blockade of access to this information and/or high costs and (ii) loss of data and potentioal for technology transfer for the foreseeable future. In either case the effect on both the scientific and broader community will be detrimental.

Again, I agree.

They discuss several possible solutions to maintaining the viability of publicly available databases including a private-public dual tier system where for-profits paid an annual fee and academic researchers have free access. They mention Uniprot, which underwent a funding crisis over a decade ago, as an example. Uniprot (then Swissprot) went back to complete public funding in 2002. There are still several other databases that are attempting to fund themselves by such a model. BioBase is one where several databases have been folded. TransFac is one. There is a free, reduced functionality, version that is available to academics through gene-regulation.com and the fuller version for a subscription at BioBase. This former version allows some data to be shared, as one could see at VISTA or UCSC. I am not privy to the financials of BioBase and other similar models, and I assume that will work for some, but I agree with the authors that many useful databases and resources would be hard-pressed to be maintained this way.

Other possibilities include fully  including databases under a single public institution funding mechanism. The many databases of NCBI and EBI fit this model. In fact, there is even a recent case of a resource being folded into this model at NCBI. Again, this works for some, but not all useful resources.

Most will have to find variable methods for funding their databases. Considering the importance of doing so, it is imperative that viable models are found. The authors reject, out of hand, advertising. As they mention, most advertisers will not be drawn to website advertising without a visibility of at least 10,000 visitors per month. There might be some truth to this (and I need to read the reference they cite that use to back that up).

But the next model they suggest seems to me to have the same drawback. In this model, the database or resource would have a ‘partnership of core competencies.’ An example they cite is MMdb (not to be confused with MMDB). This virtual mutant mouse repository provides direct trial links to Invitrogen from it’s gene information to the product page. They mention that though 6 companies were approached, only one responded. It would seem that this model has the same issues as directly selling advertising.

They also mention that, at least for their research community of mouse functional genomics, “Institutional Funding” seems the best solution for long-term viability and open access. Unfortunately, until institutions like NIH and EMBL are willing or able to fund these databases, I’m not sure that’s thats a solution.

As they mention in the paper, the rate of growth of the amounts and types of data that is being generated is exponential. I am not sure that government or institutional funding can financially keep up with housing the infrastructure needed to maintain and further develop these databases so that all the data generated can remain publicly and freely accessible.

Information is should be free, but unfortunately it is not without cost. It will be interesting to see how funding of databases and resources evolves in this fast growing genomics world (and imperative we figure out solutions).

PS: On a personal note, the authors use their resource, EMMA (European Mouse Mutant Archive), as an example in the paper. I like the name since it’s the name of my daughter, but it just goes to prove that names come in waves. We named our daughter thinking few would name their daughter the same. When even databases name the same name, you know that’s not the case.

Last week, scientists from LCROSS announced that they had detected "a buttload" of water on the Moon.  Let's go over what happened and what it means.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_b/water.jpg" width="500" title="Umm... this isn&amp;#39;t exactly what I meant by &amp;#39;water on the Moon.&amp;#39;" alt="water.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon is very different from Earth.  It has &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; atmosphere (literally, less than one atom thick), day-and-night lasts for two weeks apiece, and the temperature extremes are horrifically severe.  But one of the biggest differences?  Whereas the Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees as it goes around the Sun, the Moon is tilted &lt;b&gt;by less than two degrees&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_b/13743.moon_rotation.jpg" width="500" title="At 1.54 degrees, the Moon is nearly perfectly aligned with the Sun." alt="13743.moon_rotation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hugely important.  On Earth, because of the 23.5 degree tilt, every place on Earth receives a significant amount of sunlight at some point during the year.  But with a tilt that tiny on the Moon, the Sun never gets more than 1.54 degrees above the horizon as seen from either the North or South Pole of the Moon!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_b/winter-solstice-fairbanks-alaska.jpg" width="500" title="Even this picture, from Winter Solstice at Fairbanks, Alaska, has the Sun rising more than 1.54 degrees above the horizon!" alt="winter-solstice-fairbanks-alaska.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, if you dug a hole that was 100 meters deep and 100 meters wide, only the top 2.7 meters of your hole would ever get illuminated by the Sunlight, and the bottom 97.3 meters would be &lt;b&gt;permanently shadowed&lt;/b&gt;.  So if you ever put water in that hole, it should freeze and remain frozen for all eternity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we don't have holes that have been dug at the poles, but we do have "natural" holes.  These appear as humongous craters, like so.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_b/20071113_kaguya_LPOD.jpg" width="500" title="Hello, Shackleton crater, and thank you, Kaguya!" alt="20071113_kaguya_LPOD.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did we do with LCROSS?  We crashed it into one of these permanently shadowed craters, and looked at the debris plume that got shot up from the impact.  If we find a huge amount of water, then we can infer that pretty much all of these permanently shadowed craters on the Moon are loaded with huge amounts of water, and will be for pretty much the next billion years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_b/09moon-600.jpg" width="500" title="Although you couldn&amp;#39;t hear the sound from space, you could hear it if you put your ear to the Moon&amp;#39;s surface!" alt="09moon-600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the fact that we found "a buttload" of water?  That means the Moon's craters at the North and South poles are loaded up with reservoirs of water, and all we have to do is go there and claim it.  Hooray for exploration!  Hooray for space!  And hooray &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.com/663/"&gt;for the Moon!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/the_big_deal_about_lcross.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258419648914"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2427592700894374301">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b5b18ddb708d274</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Genetic Load</title><published>2009-11-16T23:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T23:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/11/genetic-load.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;If the average rate of deleterious mutations is about 1 per individual per generation then the species can't survive. It means that most offspring will carry a mutation. This is an intolerable genetic load for a species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact it's worse than that. Simple calculations suggest than even a rate of 0.1 deleterious mutations per individual will spell doom for the species. This is a well-known limitation and it was widely used in developing several key components of evolutionary theory and in explaining the size and composition of eukaryotic genomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The average total mutation rate in humans is about 130 mutations per genome per generation. Scordova concludes that this proves Intelligent Design Creationism [&lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/nachmans-paradox-defeats-darwinism-and-dawkins-weasel/"&gt;Nachman’s Paradox Defeats Darwinism and Dawkins’ Weasel&lt;/a&gt;].

One such item I saw today turns out to be relevant to my research interests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/96?referer=rss"&gt;The directed percolation phase transition, a phenomenon much mathematicized about, has finally been spotted in the laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  As the abstract of &lt;a href="http://physics.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.80.051116.pdf"&gt;Takeuchi &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; (2009)&lt;/a&gt; says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a comprehensive report on the phase transition between two turbulent states of electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals, which was recently found by the authors to be in the directed percolation (DP) universality class [K. A. Takeuchi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 234503 (2007)]. We further investigate both static and dynamic critical behaviors of this phase transition, measuring a total of 12 critical exponents, 5 scaling functions, and 8 scaling relations, all in full agreement with those characterizing the DP class in 2+1 dimensions.  Developing an experimental technique to create a seed of topological-defect turbulence by pulse laser, we confirm in particular the rapidity symmetry, which is a basic but non-trivial consequence of the field-theoretic approach to DP. This provides a clear experimental realization of this outstanding truly out-of-equilibrium universality class, dominating most phase transitions into an absorbing state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I care about this will be explained at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;When a friend teaching a college scriptwriting  course told students that standard videotape runs at 30 frames per second,  a hand shot up. "Actually," corrected the young man who owned the arm to which the hand was attached, "it's 29.97 frames  per second." Thus it began. For the rest of the semester, no gnat  was safe from this fellow's interrupting the class to strain at it.</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Steve Cuno)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258417695844"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=4399">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d7b02d142340c722</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">An ID Proponent Denies Global Warming</title><published>2009-11-16T23:44:06Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T23:44:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/16/an-id-proponent-denies-global-warming/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow. The &lt;a href="http://www.michaelmedved.com/"&gt;Medved Show&lt;/a&gt; today went very differently than I expected. I was all prepared to talk about evolution and intelligent design; instead, Stephen Meyer of the anti-evolutionist Discovery Institute spent far more time attacking climate science than evolutionary science. In this endeavor, he pulled out all the old chestnuts: the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Petition"&gt;Oregon Petition&lt;/a&gt;, cooling during the 1970s, the alleged end to warming in this decade, satellite versus ground temperature measurements…egads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have more to say here about what I meant to say &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, but for now, just an observation: If I were Meyer, and I wanted to make the case for intelligent design as good &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, I would not tie my position at all to global warming denial, much less in such a close way as I heard him doing today. That’s two wildly controversial scientific positions to explain, instead of one; it starts you down the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/12/dont-forget-shakespeare-denialism/"&gt;Tom Bethell road&lt;/a&gt; of denying almost everything, including HIV/AIDS and even relativity and even even Shakespeare’s authorship of his plays. Not good for credibility….and it makes me wonder, how many folks from the Discovery Institute also attack climate science?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258416410364"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=4756">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa4c4c7d8ba3ff08</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Life?s 4 Living to close?</title><published>2009-11-16T22:41:10Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T22:41:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/11/16/lifes-4-living-to-close/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Trustees of Life's 4 Living "came to a decision to cease all fund-raising activities and close the charity".&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=holfordwatch.info&amp;amp;blog=1336499&amp;amp;post=4756&amp;amp;subd=holfordwatch&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>jonhw</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258416410364"><id gr:original-id="786 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d50847f7b466a4b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Open your eyes to darker skies</title><published>2009-11-16T22:28:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T22:28:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/786" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; The night skies above our cities and towns - even our villages - glow a bright sodium orange; the most brilliant stars our galaxy has to offer glow feebly through this colourful canopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/newsrele.nsf/WebPRByCountryLang/3CFD750C977A5FDD8025766F00392085" title="Galloway - Dark Sky Park"&gt;Galloway Forest Park&lt;/a&gt; has recently been honoured with the status of the UK's first Dark Sky Park. Perhaps it is time for us to dim the lights on the skies above all our cities.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who needs 'em!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It's estimated that as little as 10% of the population of the UK live in an area where they can see the bright band of The Milky Way. I wonder how many of the remaining 90% think, like i used to, that it is entirely normal to look up on a dark and clear winter's night and see a modest scattering of stars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed stargazing for as long as I can remember; I've whiled away countless hours peering out into the universe both with my binoculars and my unaided eye. But I didn't sit under a dark, truly dark, sky until I spent last Christmas in the English Lake District. I suspect that a large amount of the population wouldn't think that there is anything to be gained by drastically cutting light pollution - not too long ago I would have fallen into this camp. On my holiday, though, I was floored - totally and utterly floored - by the thousands of stars that peppered the sky, and the eerie sense of having the entire cosmos wrapped around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of making a point I've included 2 photos below - one taken from my garden in Bristol, one from the holiday I mentioned above. Same camera, same time of year, same viewing conditions. How depressing that it took me 22 years to see such a magnificent sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/3010/pollution.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/3010/pollution.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="light pollution"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/8642/darkskies.jpg" title="dark skies"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/8642/darkskies.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers aren't troubled a great deal by the light pollution that plagues our towns and cities. Most professional telescopes are situated well away from artificial sources of light, and sodium streetlamps shine in such a narrow spectrum that their effects are quite easily mitigated by filters. Wouldn't it be nice if every resident of every city was afforded a brilliant starry sky?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money, money, money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I guess the only reasonable objection to making the switch to darker skies is the cost of replacing or modifying significant amounts of lighting in our cities and towns, and along our motorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of replacing lighting may indeed be high, but when you consider that more efficient lighting should equate to lower running costs the change starts to seem more attractive. Every photon that escapes a light fixture and finds itself heading skywards represents wasted energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution then is not to remove lighting and make navigation a nightmare, but to introduce efficient lighting that illuminates only what it needs to. &lt;a href="http://www.socalgas.com/construction/builders/Builders%20Resource%20Guide/Full%20Cut.htm"&gt;Full cutoff lighting&lt;/a&gt; achieves this by utilising flat lenses parallel to the ground to ensure that no light at all shines at an angle greater than 90degrees to the fixture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many organisations trying to secure darker skies - among them &lt;a href="http://www.darkskysociety.org/news.cfm"&gt;the Dark Sky Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.need-less.org.uk/"&gt;Need-less&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.darkskyscotland.org.uk/"&gt;Dark Sky Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.britastro.org/dark-skies/"&gt;the Campaign for Dark Skies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So consider supporting one of those organistions, or writing to the authorities in your area, or highlighting by any means the pitiful state of our national skies - and perhaps, one day, we'll all be seeing stars. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Josh</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258413808913"><id gr:original-id="786 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5304394dd45e637c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="astronomy" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1115"/><category term="full cutoff lighting" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1116"/><category term="light pollution" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1114"/><category term="space" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/512"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/science"/><title type="html">Open your eyes to darker skies</title><published>2009-11-16T22:28:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T22:28:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/786" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; The night skies above our cities and towns - even our villages - glow a bright sodium orange; the most brilliant stars our galaxy has to offer glow feebly through this colourful canopy.&lt;/p&gt;

But it should be, particularly if you’re a man, according to a new study in the journal Health Psychology – and not just to save your partner’s feelings.

In the heat of stressful conflict, your brain is commanding the release of a stress-chemical cocktail comprised of proteins called cytokines–produced by cells in the immune system to help the body mount an immune response during infection.

Abnormally high levels of these proteins are linked to cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.  This study suggests that how rational or emotional your communication is directly corresponds with the levels of those chemicals in your body and the damage they can do.

And atheists will appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this excerpt from an Associated Press article about the Catholics and their &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hdPBCaGtHcdITCACaEBWARF9CFnAD9BS1U0G0"&gt;stance on clergy celibacy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Apparently seeking to squash any speculation that Rome had been courting the disaffected Anglicans, the Vatican said the “Holy Spirit” inspired Anglicans to “petition repeatedly and insistently to be received into full Catholic communion” individually and as a group.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quotation marks around “Holy Spirit.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ways to interpret this.  One is that it’s part of a longer quotation (which did not include the words “inspired Anglicans to”).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, the sentence could have been written &lt;a href="http://www.getreligion.org/?p=21323&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+getreligion%2FDmXm+%28GetReligion%29#comment-156057"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Vatican said the “Holy Spirit [inspired Anglicans to] petition repeatedly and insistently to be received into full Catholic communion.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes sense but it’s not nearly as interesting &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interpretation is that the marks were used in the context of: It doesn’t really exist, but that’s what they call it, so we’ll just put quotation marks around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this an intentional jab at anyone who believes in the Trinity?  (Or should I say, “Trinity”?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terry Mattingly&lt;/strong&gt; at Get Religion &lt;a href="http://www.getreligion.org/?p=21323&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+getreligion%2FDmXm+%28GetReligion%29"&gt;doesn’t like the implication if that’s true&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What do you think is going on here, precisely? Why is the existence or the activity of this one member of the Holy Trinity now subject to grammatical doubt? Has one corner of the Trinity been demoted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is part of a larger change in AP style. If so, are Christians now followers of “Jesus Christ”? When people survive some horrible disaster, are we supposed to report that they felt comforted by the presence of “God”? Do people now praise or express anger at “God” when wrestling with the big issues of life? I guess that when President Barack Obama ends a speech now, journalists are supposed to quote him saying: ” ‘God’ bless you and ‘God’ bless America.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That.  Would.  Be.  Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see “God” in quotation marks from the mainstream media:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After Little Billy was rescued from the well, his family said it was their faith in “God” that got them through the night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks right to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if this article contains accurate use of the quotation marks in the sense of a larger quotation, broken up by words not in the quotation, there’s an argument to make for the use of them when discussing specific references to mythology — like “Noah’s Ark” or the “Garden of Eden.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a question humans have been asking for time out of mind . . . I mean, for about two or three months. Because that’s when creationist and originator of the intelligently designed banana canon, Ray Comfort, introduced the idea. And he did so with no small measure of his own special brand of mustachioed, self-satisfied arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, November 19, a few days before the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin’s classic work, Comfort plans to distribute free copies of “Origin” at colleges and universities across the U.S. and (on the 24th) in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These free copies include a special introduction by Comfort, which claims, among other things, that evolution is scientifically false and that Darwin was a misogynist racist whose ideas inspired Hitler. (BTW, I heard he settled on the misogynist racist angle because he thought saying Darwin raped dolphins and ate kittens for breakfast was a little too far-fetched.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about spoiling an anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do not despair, folks. There is some good news in all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put Comfort’s claims in perspective — and to aid scientists, teachers, students, and other concerned citizens in protesting Comfort’s distortions — the &lt;a href="http://ncseprojects.org/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt; has created a special website chock-full of advice, analysis, background information, videos, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click on &lt;a href="http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/"&gt;http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/&lt;/a&gt; to see some of the tools the NCSE is providing, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NCSE Safety Bookmark — A tongue-in-cheek tool for separating the Comfort introduction from the rest of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Why Ray Comfort is Wrong” — A flyer detailing Comfort’s wacky take on science, history, and theology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A “Public Service Announcement” video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posters and signs you can get printed for Comfort’s event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A detailed backgrounder on the Comfort introduction, pointing out the flaws, distortions, misinterpretations, and other problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites, books, journals and other science resources devoted to evolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to Dr. Eugenie Scott’s debate with Comfort on U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report’s web site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of the colleges and universities that Comfort claims to be targeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the website, and forward the link around to all your chums.

There are three Nobel Laureates who might be associated with the creature but two of them have already been covered.

Consequently, I have two extra free lunches for deserving undergraduates. I'm going to award an &lt;u&gt;additional&lt;/u&gt; prize to the first &lt;u&gt;undergraduate student&lt;/u&gt; who can accept it.

&lt;p&gt;At 2:28 pm Eastern Standard Time, the space shuttle Atlantis left Earth. It was a flawless launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/11/photo3.jpg" alt="Atlantis launch!" title="Atlantis launch!" width="345"&gt;It is, of course, hard to describe the experience of watching it go up. I was surprised by just how bright it was. It’s like a mini-Sun, which is roughly right since it burns its liquid hydrogen/oxygen fuel at 3000 C, just a factor of two short of the temperature of the Sun. And, of course, it is loud. Not “hurt my ears” loud. More like “my whole body is vibrating” loud. Very intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was over in a couple of minutes. I guess the shuttle was eager to get to space. It’s been all dressed up and waiting for days. All too soon the painfully bright light had disappeared. The overwhelming sound had subsided. And the only sign of the absolutely amazing event we’d just witnessed were the slowly dissipating clouds of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it is an incredible accomplishment. We have just shot six people into space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ID theorists, apparently, have a very high opinion of themselves, believing they are fueling a scientific revolution of Copernican proportions. ID proponent Michael Behe has even written that the alleged discovery of design in nature “rivals those of Newton and Einstein, Lavoisier and Schrodinger, Pasteur and Darwin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, ID proponents regularly fling around the idea that they are on the leading edge of a scientific “paradigm shift,” about to dramatically change the course of science by reimporting appeals to a designer into a framework that had previously been dominated by an ideology of “scientific materialism.” Alas, this depiction of IDists as scientific revolutionaries is highly dubious. It’s very easy to for anyone to blithely say they’re causing a paradigm shift, especially as the claim is probably irrefutable except with the benefit of hindsight. The hard part is actually delivering the scientific goods.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ID proponent Stephen Meyer’s latest book, &lt;em&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/em&gt;–which I’ve been reading because I’ve agreed to appear with Meyer on the &lt;a href="http://www.michaelmedved.com/"&gt;Michael Medved show&lt;/a&gt; today at 4 ET–we find the “paradigm shift” argument used once again–but with a  dubious new twist. Meyer, trained as a historian of science, makes an argument that focuses on the medium in which an alleged paradigm shift in science is conveyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since World War II, scientists have stressed the importance of publishing their work in specialized peer-reviewed journals, but throughout the history of science “paradigm-shifting” ideas and theories have typically been presented in books, including many that we might now call “trade press” (rather than academic) books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this. First, books allow scientists to make sustained and comprehensive arguments for synthetic new ideas…books have often been the go-to genre for presenting and evaluating new arguments for synthetic interpretations of a relevant body of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, the best-known example of this form of scientific discourse was provided by Charles Darwin himself, who famously described his work in &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&lt;/em&gt; as “one long argument.” There, Darwin proposed a comprehensive interpretation of many diverse lines of evidence…Other scientists such as Newton, Copernicus, Galileo, and Lyell as well as a host of lesser figures have used books to advance scientific arguments in favor of novel and comprehensive interpretations of the scientific evidence in their disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set aside the hubris of this for a moment (Meyer is essentially saying that his popular, non peer-reviewed book is capable of causing a paradigm shift, and is likening it to Darwin’s “one long argument”). Just focus on the history of science argument about books versus scientific papers as repositories of deep insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I find this argument deeply misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout much of the history of science, specialized scientific journals didn’t exist in the form in which they do today. Neither did specialized “science” itself–the word “scientist” to denote a profession didn’t even exist until the 19th century. And so of course, sweeping argumentative books were often used to advance scientific arguments. Copernicus was an early scientific test run for the printing press, and surely wouldn’t be famous without it. As for Galileo, he didn’t just write books, he wrote lengthy Plato-style &lt;em&gt;dialogues&lt;/em&gt;–nowadays a rare genre indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the history of science shows any undeniable trend, it is towards increasing specialization–a trend that itself is virtually synonymous with scientific &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;. As printing became cheaper, and scientists became more numerous, specialized journals emerged even as scientific fields divided and subdivided. And this was, for the most part, a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt;–for it allowed scientists in different disciplines to home more carefully in on problems, and to  speak about them in a shared language addressed to a kindred group of specialists. Granted, such developments also made science less accessible to the broad public. But in terms of advancing knowledge, it was definitely a gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Meyer’s claim that writing a trade book, today, classes him with Darwin, Newton, Copernicus, et al, is so stunning. It ignores the great progress that has occurred over the course of science’s history, which is the very reason that we now have specialized journals. What’s more, contra Meyer, we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;have a scientific genre today that exists to synthesize a large body of scientific knowledge: large peer reviewed scientific assessments, such as those produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the National Academy of Sciences. (Let’s see Meyer get his pro-ID arguments endorsed by one of those.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade books can be quite scientifically accurate, and quite thoughtful. But today they are largely for popularization–which, of course, is  what Meyer is really doing for intelligent design. He’s very good at this, and he may win a lot of conservative Christian followers and book buyers; but that is hardly the same as initiating a modern scientific paradigm shift. I highly doubt such an achievement is even possible for ID theorists, in light of the inherent supernaturalism of their position, which makes it fundamentally irreconcilable with modern, naturalistic science. But the fact remains that if ID theorists want to win scientific credibility, the peer reviewed literature (and the peer reviewed assessments) are the only way for them to go–for good historic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258406423400"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=7410">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/828d85c61d2eb294</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Hippo critic</title><published>2009-11-16T21:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T21:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/8r7dspRdNx4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/16/hippo-critic/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Will I be able to use &lt;a href="http://motivatedphotos.com/?id=27658"&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

Oldfield, a  26 yr old Western Michigan University graduate. What d'ya think? Here's what he wrote: &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I didn’t so much read this book as skimmed it.  I read the first few chapters, and skimmed the rest, after repeatedly falling asleep or getting annoyed while reading....My annoyance was mainly because it read like someone’s term paper, citing philosophers and their theories briefly, and then saying why someone else refutes them, briefly. So, either you have to be really familiar with everyone from Thomas Aquinas to Kant, in which case, why are you bothering to read about this, or you have to keep Wikipedia up at all times in order to follow Loftus’ arguments...And, if you aren’t familiar with these theological arguments, it will be even harder to follow because Loftus starts to sound like an old dusty manuscript...To me, John Loftus sounds like the kind of sophomoric douche bag you meet at a coffee shop, who knows just enough about religion and philosophy and science to sound really smart, but really just talks in circles. He might be a great guy, but at this point I’m too irked to think otherwise. &lt;a href="http://bibliofreakblog.com/nonfiction/atheist-iby-john-loftusi/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8896269794314064745?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We both recommend it enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;

Last night he made a decision in the final minutes that led his team the New England Patriots to defeat. It will likely go down as one of the most criticized decisions any coach has ever made. With his team leading by six points and just over two minutes left in the game, he elected to go for it on fourth down on his own side of the field. His offense failed to get the first down, and the Indianapolis Colts promptly drove for a touchdown.</summary><author><name>By STEVEN D.

&lt;p&gt;They seem to be the skeptical response to almost every woo-claim. If I left the house and talked to real people in real life, I’d probably use those phrases in real conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, those phrases are my skeptical pet peeve. Yes, they’re true. Yes, they are important rules for us to live by. But I feel like they are used to dismiss any correlation or anecdotal claim out of hand. It’s as if the phrases are “Correlation does not equal causation and any correlation always means nothing more than coincidence” and “Anecdote is your story of personal deception or confirmation bias”. In fact, I’ve seen some pedants even dismiss facts because they included anecdotal information around them (i.e., This happened to me and it was only then that I learned…”, or a personal account of how something factual affected someone, or dismissing this AI out of hand because it’s a personal anecdote.) The thing is, correlation means that there is something connecting two things… and those two things may &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; may not be related. And an anecdote may not be proof, but that doesn’t mean it’s worthless, and anecdotes are an effective way of spreading information and helping people understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hate when believers are described as “stupid”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your skeptical pet peeve?  Is there anything skeptics do that gets under your skin at times?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/billboard_San_Diego_CoR_hi-res_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://unitedcor.org/images/billboard_San_Diego_CoR_hi-res_2.jpg" title="SanDiegoCoR" width="550" height="372"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re already getting some &lt;a href="http://www.sandiego.com/index.php?option=com_sdca&amp;amp;target=394f35ff-2ce2-49cf-9218-5ea091385f10"&gt;great publicity&lt;/a&gt; for it and local CoR coordinator &lt;strong&gt;Debbie Allen Skomer&lt;/strong&gt; is doing a terrific job of explaining the group’s reason for putting up the sign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see her in &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2009/11/12/dnt.xetv.atheist.billboard.xetv"&gt;this CNN video&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in that video is a guy who says he doesn’t like the ad because it’s “attacking somebody’s belief.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the wonderful parts of this campaign is that it shows how ridiculous some religious people are — people who can’t even read a couple short statements on the billboard, but who are quick to come to a judgment about what the message says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Diego Coalition of Reason is just calling out to other atheists in the area and letting them know they’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how I know that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I know how to read and that’s what the billboard says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now was that so hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the English speaking world (UK and Commonwealth), "going rogue" is a euphemism for heterosexual women engaging in anal intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I was at first suspicious, since the comment appeared over a year after the original posting, and many such long-delayed comments are spam, but this one looks legit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Added 11/18: As I say in a follow-up posting, DGA is legit, and so is the comment, in the sense that he did post the comment and did so earnestly. But it turns out that his sources were playing a prank on him.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a euphemistic use of &lt;em&gt;going rogue&lt;/em&gt; was news to me, but then there are lots of usages I haven't noticed. Anderson didn't give any cites, and I haven't been able to find any, so that for the moment I suspect that euphemistic uses are neither widespread nor frequent, but I'm open for evidence (beyond some individual readers saying that they're familiar with the use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Added 11/18: I'm now convinced that claims about this use are sheer invention.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anderson's comment went on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to imagine that Ms Palin is unaware of this connotation in choosing it for the title of her book, given that she has never been above flirting with straight male admirers in any of her gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't follow this at all. There are two problematic things here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I don't get the connection between Palin's flirtatious behavior and the expectation that she should be aware of sexual euphemisms (including those not current in the U.S.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I don&amp;#39;t accept the idea that an expression that can serve as a sexual euphemism on some occasions has a sexual connotation on all occasions — that is, that any sexually tinged use contaminates all uses. That&amp;#39;s a preposterous idea; a great many euphemisms work because they use perfectly ordinary vocabulary. Context is all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I didn't find the use Anderson reports, I did find one example of &lt;em&gt;go rogue&lt;/em&gt; with a reference to anal intercourse. It's from a comment by "thefrontpage" on a November 5 &lt;a href="http://wonkette.com/412017/george-w-bush-and-bill-clinton-are-not-going-to-debate-if-people-are-going-to-get-all-excited-about-it"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; by Wonkette, who passed on a story about a proposed Clinton-Bush debate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cancelled [the debate] after Clinton said he was going to &amp;quot;go rogue&amp;quot; on Bush, but Bush knows the real meaning of &amp;quot;going rogue&amp;quot; (unprotected anal sex), and he took offense at that, …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the whole comment is a humorous invention, so it's hard for me to take any part of it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the idea that the "real meaning" of &lt;em&gt;go rogue&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;#39;engage in unprotected anal sex&amp;#39; is silly. The conventional meaning of the expression is something like &amp;#39;deviate greatly from training or expected behavior; cease to follow orders; go off on one&amp;#39;s own&amp;#39; — a meaning that developed from &lt;em&gt;rogue&lt;/em&gt; 'that which lacks appropriate control; something which is irresponsible or undisciplined' (as &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;2 puts it, along with citations from 1964 on), which in turn seems to have developed from &lt;em&gt;rogue elephant&lt;/em&gt; 'elephant driven away, or living apart, fom the herd, and of a savage or destructive disposition' (attested in &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;2 from 1859 on).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258399564949"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2733">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d811d4a28f7229d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="flu"/><category term="H1N1"/><category term="Vaccine"/><title type="html">H1N1 Pandemic Update</title><published>2009-11-16T19:00:10Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T19:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2733" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a special episode of the&lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt; Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; podcast, I host a discussion with David Gorski, Mark Crislip, and Joe Albietz about the flu, the H1N1 “swine” flu pandemic, and the controversies surrounding the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Grothe’s podcast, and am glad to be &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/"&gt;back on this week&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the description, which provides a very accurate view of our arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Chris Mooney is a 2009-2010 Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT and author of three books, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Storm World&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored by Sheril Kirshenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Chris Mooney talks about the growing divide between science and society. He contrasts the issues addressed in &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt; with the current problems facing society as outlined in &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;. He argues for the unique public policy significance of science for society, and why scientific literacy matters more than other kinds of cultural or historical literacy. He discusses the policy relevance of scientific illiteracy in terms of global warming and biotechnology. He talks about the need for scientists to become better communicators to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;He shares his criticisms of the New Atheists and explains why their attacks against religious moderates work counter to the goal of scientific literacy. He recounts his experiences as an atheist activist while in college, and how his views have changed about campus [freethought] activism since that time. He explores other underlying causes of scientific illiteracy, including our educational system, the media’s dysfunctional treatment of science, and growing anti-science movements such as the climate deniers and vaccine skeptics. And he details concrete actions that science advocates can take in order to increase scientific literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a slow-peaking shower, so even if you go out tonight, or later than Tuesday, you’ll probably see a few meteors streaking across the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about them many times in the past; a review is on &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/leonids.html"&gt;my Bad Astronomy site&lt;/a&gt;, and I wrote &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/08/09/12-things-you-need-to-watch-the-perseid-meteors-sunday-night/"&gt;a guide to watching the Perseids&lt;/a&gt; which is still apropos of the Leonids. &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/10nov_leonids2009.htm?list1117568"&gt;NASA’s science news page&lt;/a&gt; has lots of info, and &lt;a href="http://www.imo.net/calendar/2009#leo"&gt;the International Meteor Organization&lt;/a&gt; has technical aspects, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 5 astronauts have masters degrees. 3 were successful football players. 1 has a PhD (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Satcher"&gt;and an MD as well&lt;/a&gt;, just for good measure). I’m not sure what that says about the requirements to go into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The astronauts go into quarantine for a week before the launch. They don’t want any swine flu in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- We are on hallowed ground. This is where humans left the Earth to touch the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- This is the 129th space shuttle launch. The first was in 1981, for an average of one launch every three months. The whole idea was to make space launch “routine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I calculate that it takes roughly thirty times more energy to get to the space station than it does to get a jet aircraft to altitude. Radius of the Earth: 6,400 km. Altitude of a jet: 12 km. Altitude of the space station: 350 km. (Gravitational potential energy goes as one over the distance.) However, it is to be noted that you want to actually stay up there once you get there, which means you need to be moving pretty fast (specifically, 28,000 km/hour at the altitude of the space station). Kinetic energy goes as velocity squared. This is why you need a kiloton bomb (see my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/11/16/countdown/trackback/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;) to get up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- As a mission control specialist described launch: “It’s like going over the top of a rollercoaster. Forever.” Actually, that sounds more like what it must be like in orbit: free-fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- They monitor everything that happens on the space station. Including light switches and toilet flushes. Think big brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The countdown clock is not linear. There are a number of planned “holds”, where they STOP THE CLOCK and check various systems, and then resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- We are roughly 3 miles from the launchpad. This distance was selected by calculating, should the unthinkable happen, how far a 50 pound chunk of debris would fly. We are just beyond that distance, trying not to think about what 40 pounds might do to the media tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now 1:35:37 from launch.&lt;br&gt;

It&amp;#39;s an internet poll, but who should win this one isn&amp;#39;t at all obvious — they&amp;#39;re all contemptible. Here are the results so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adnan Oktar, aka Harun Yahya
  94 (8%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Anjem Choudary
  72 (6%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Anthony Bush
  22 (1%)
  &lt;br&gt;
British Chiropractic Association
  197 (16%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor
  51 (4%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Dermot Aherne
  84 (7%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Damian Thompson
  66 (5%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Pope Benedict XVI
  388 (33%)
  &lt;br&gt;
Terry Eagleton &amp;amp; Karen Armstrong
  57 (4%)
 &lt;br&gt;
Tony Blair
  128 (11%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's sweet that the Pope is in the lead, since he is a traditional favorite and the Church has done such a good job of stepping in the malodorous mushy fecal slime of evil this year. I'm also fond of Cormac Murphy O'Connor for decreeing that atheists are "not fully human," a state to which I aspire but am constantly foiled by my merely human genetics and physiology. My clicky finger was also drawn to Oktar, who is not only a creationist of the foulest, dumbest sort, but may even be clinically insane. I finally voted for Eagleton/Armstrong, simply because I think their brand of gooey, meaningless drivel is far more common than Christian or Islamic fanaticism, and they represent it so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't use my choice as a guide! This is one of those polls where it wouldn't be bad if it ended up in a 10-way tie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/vote_on_the_bad_faith_awards.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ZZCBxW-eOIk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258396666378"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/argument_from_ignorance_ignora.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e94c994aaba0006d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Argument from ignorance, ignorance the size of Alaska</title><published>2009-11-16T16:57:45Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T16:57:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/H8D8-094Fn4/argument_from_ignorance_ignora.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/argument_from_ignorance_ignora.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;She has so much of it to spread around, too. &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/15/palin-book-evolution/"&gt;Sarah Palin's memoir reveals her unsurprising opinion about evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in this volume, she talks about creationism, saying she &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t believe in the theory that human beings — thinking, loving beings — originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; or from &lt;span&gt;"monkeys who eventually swung down from the trees."&lt;/span&gt; In everything that happens to her, from meeting Todd to her selection by Mr. McCain for the Republican ticket, she sees the hand of God: &lt;span&gt;"My life is in His hands. I encourage readers to do what I did many years ago, invite Him in to take over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, about half the American electorate will think what she wrote is just ducky. Those words won't dissuade very many voters at all, so don't make the mistake of thinking this revelation will somehow cripple her campaign to become president of the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/argument_from_ignorance_ignora.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/H8D8-094Fn4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258396666378"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/oh_yeahthat_debate.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/625cde4c95c2b8e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Local"/><title type="html">Oh, yeah…that debate</title><published>2009-11-16T16:47:09Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T16:47:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/sLEh1jigrFE/oh_yeahthat_debate.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/oh_yeahthat_debate.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those who were wondering, it's still happening. 7:30pm tonight, at the North Star Ballroom in the St Paul Student Center, 2017 Buford Ave. S.

It's the combination of hyperbole, unintentional irony, and oblivious incompetence, all spiced with a germ of truth, that makes it amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers, like Dawkins when he's tired and especially the gruesome Dennett, survives entirely on scorn and venom. His response to any challenge is simply to increase the number and volume of schoolyard taunts. These guys are intellectual alchemists who have perfected the art of using invective to turn philistinism into apparent sagacity. The formula goes something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 1--Begin by describing a philosophical challenge with a mixture of anger and fatigue, much as you would describe discovering a termite in your house after the extermintor had been through and presumably destroyed them all. The contempt must ooze front and center before you even address the argument so that anyone who might be inclined to take the challenge seriously is forwarned and suitably cowed. Don't skimp on the insulting adjectives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 2--Deflect the issue from the profoundly philosophical to the mundane by suddenly talking lab gobbledegook about genes, mutations, etc. Use words like phenotype liberally and try to throw in a diagram. Extra points for insisting Darwin himself was well aware of what you are saying and would have agreed with you unreservedly;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 3--Insist that any argument that comes within a hundred miles of religion, no matter how ethereal or tentative, leads directly to biblical literalism, perferably as practiced in the American South. Show in one paragraph how it is the root of every atrocity in history, will lead to the end of scientific inquiry and justifies the bombing of innocent villagers by the U.S. Air Force.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 4--Bask in the glow of hundreds of one-sentence comments thanking you profusely for your courage and agreeing you have proven there is no need to read what your opponent said to know that the stupid twit isn't even worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1 must be a good one, since it's the tactic the commenter is using. I wonder if he noticed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2 is my favorite. I like his admission that the &amp;quot;profoundly philosophical,&amp;quot; to his mind, is untainted with mundane reality, and that when talking about explanations for our origins (which is usually what prompts my scornful interventions), genes and mutations are mere &amp;quot;gobbledygook&amp;quot;. I know exactly where he is coming from, then — the land of the ignorant, where people are baffled and resentful of the intrusion of evidence. This must also be why he finds Dennett so gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3, unfortunately, is way off base. I'm one of those guys who thinks even moderate, liberal theism is wacky in and of itself: I don't need to tie Karen Armstrong to Ken Ham to make her look absurd. I also think people would commit atrocities without religion prodding them on, too. I don't believe the South is particularly deserving of scorn; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bell_Riley"&gt;Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt; operated out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for instance. I never endorse bombing any villages anywhere, sorry. His diatribe would have been improved if he'd left out this one point, which is so baseless it undermines the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4 has a tiny leavening of truth because there are lots of people who find common ground with me and are predisposed to agree with my interpretation of events, and so yes, this blog is a meeting place for mobs of atheists. So? Unfortunately for my ego, a few of the comments will be disagreements, while most are people wrangling with each other; the long threads get that way because I spark something that leads to discussion and argument. I don't get to accept even all the insults, because I'm mostly irrelevant to the conversation within a few hours of starting it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, I'm afraid people don't have the luxury of completely bypassing my target's words. I link back and quote liberally (gosh, there they are, the commenter's whole screed, right there in my post), and people are always tossing in fresh new absurdities from the source. A perfect example is right there in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/for_gods_sake_have_bryan_apple.php"&gt;post which made Bryan Appleyard indignant&lt;/a&gt;: I quoted him at length and rebutted him in detail, and poor Mr Appleyard is simply left mostly speechless, only able to screech that his feelings were hurt at being called a bad writer…and unable to address one whit of the substance of my criticisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/as_others_see_us.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/OVhF1E0G9uk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258396469897"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=21771">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4b7d8a81414746c6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="taxes"/><title type="html">More Tax Breaks for the Rich?</title><published>2009-11-16T18:16:21Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T18:16:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/P-F5bWIUQK8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/more-tax-breaks-for-the-rich/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I was talking with some folks at LSU who were working on a proposal to exempt textbooks from sales taxes in Baton Rouge, currently a whopping 9%.

gerbil, you'll surely remember that not too long ago, the Intelligent Design
folks, with the help of Ben Stein, put together a whole movie about how
evilutionists are all a bunch of evil fascists, out to silence the poor,
hard-working IDers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; You'll also remember that Bill Dembski has been talking up the fact that
he's got two peer reviewed papers allegedly about intelligent design. So,
you'd think that after complaining about being locked out of the debate,
now that he has some actual papers to talk about, he'd be eager to, well,
talk about them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yeah, right. As it turns out, debate is the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing that Bill
wants. When someone took a good look at one of his papers, and
posted a critique, Bill's response was the threaten to sue them for
copyright violation. Knowing how utterly trustworthy the Disco gang
is, I've got a screen-capture of the post with the threat below the fold, in

I am finally reading Bruce Hood's &lt;i&gt;SuperSense&lt;/i&gt;, though, and I will probably have a lot to say about it shortly.  In the meantime, since I have nothing original to say, how about some cool links?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Socialist Fire Departments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just made a similar joke on the Dispatches blog a week or so ago, but &lt;a href="http://angrytownhall.com/"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; carries it much farther.  Bravo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3-D Mandelbrot attempt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So a true 3-D equivalent of the Mandelbrot -- with its simple formula, and its unending and consistent complexity -- is apparently somewhat of the holy grail of 3-D fractals.  &lt;a href="http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbulb.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a remarkable attempt, though they admit it's not quite a true 3-D Mandelbrot.  It also introduced me to the idea of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomplex_number"&gt;hypercomplex numbers&lt;/a&gt;.  Woah.  If I turn out to be totally off base on this whole atheism thing, and end up reincarnated, I'm totally going to be a math major.  Well, maybe on the third life -- next time around, I'm going with a lit major, because I am also terribly interested in that, but I'd probably get laid a lot more in college...&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4402321624956716264?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258392350789"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2729">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c5ece8426a2c49e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Clinical Trials"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Nutrition"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Cancer prevention"/><category term="Pharmaceuticals"/><category term="prostate cancer"/><category term="tamoxifen"/><title type="html">Cancer prevention: The forgotten stepchild of cancer research?</title><published>2009-11-16T17:00:51Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T17:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2729" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has been periodically running a &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/series/forty_years_war/"&gt;series about the “40 years’ war” on cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with most articles by Gina Kolata. I’ve touched on this series before, liking some parts of it, while others not so much. In particular, I criticized an article one article that I thought to be so misguided about how the NIH grant system leads researchers to “play it safe” and how we could cure cancer if we could just fund “riskier” research that I had to write an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=544"&gt;extended screed&lt;/a&gt; about the misconceptions in the article. The latest installment, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/health/research/13prevent.html"&gt;Medicines to Deter Some Cancers Are Not Taken&lt;/a&gt;, also by Kolata, is much better in that it discusses a problem at the heart of cancer, namely that we have developed drugs that can decrease the risk of specific cancers but they are not as widely used as they could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/health/research/13prevent.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; contrasts a seeming incongruity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Americans do not think twice about taking medicines to prevent heart disease and stroke. But cancer is different. Much of what Americans do in the name of warding off cancer has not been shown to matter, and some things are actually harmful. Yet the few medicines proved to deter cancer are widely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take prostate cancer, the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, surpassed only by easily treated skin cancers. More than 192,000 cases of it will be diagnosed this year, and more than 27,000 men will die from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it turns out, there is a way to prevent many cases of prostate cancer. A large and rigorous study found that a generic drug, finasteride, costing about $2 a day, could prevent as many as 50,000 cases each year. Another study found that finasteride’s close cousin, dutasteride, about $3.50 a day, has the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a contrast. Think about it. Millions of Americans take statins, for instance, to lower their cholesterol and thereby try to prevent the complications of elevated cholesterol, such as heart disease, vascular disease, and strokes. Yet, for at least two common cancers, there are proven effective drugs that will lower the risk of cancer considerably with a side effect profile at least as favorable as that of statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, preventing cancer is not like preventing heart disease. “Cancer” is not a disease, but many diseases arising from many different organs with many different biological behaviors. There is no drug that can prevent “cancer.” There are, however, specific drugs that can lower the risk of specific cancers. So right there you have a big difference that could partially explain the reticence. Which cancers should be prevented? How many different drugs are you willing to take to prevent how many different cancers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that the article points out that is quite true and has been quite disappointing to cancer researchers, and that’s that diet does not have nearly as large an effect as we had hoped. Kolata correctly points out that if we could eliminate smoking cancer deaths would decrease by about a third. Lung cancer is quite rare in nonsmokers. Indeed, back in the early part of the 20th century, lung cancer was so rare that there are reports describing how, when a patient died of it, medical students would be told that they had to go to see the autopsy because they might not ever see another case in their careers. Now lung cancer is the &lt;a href="http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/content/abstract/59/4/225?ijkey=97ff33e71c882c7f20b5f9073f52bba24e3b2693&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;single largest cause of cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women, causing 30% of cancer deaths in men and 26% of cancer deaths in women, and it’s all due to smoking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/4105805301/" title="Cancer by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2804/4105805301_ea593c66aa.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="Cancer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other preventative intervention could conceivably even come close in terms of effect as cutting smoking to zero. Obviously, such a thing will not come to pass in my lifetime, but as a cancer surgeon I can always hope, can’t I? Also as a human being, too. After all, I’ve already lost an aunt to smoking-induced lung cancer in 2008, and I have several relatives who smoke who, I fear, might well join her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Kolata suggests that avoiding hormone replacement therapy containing estrogen and progestin after menopause would be a good preventative, which may be true, but since the Women’s Health Initiative study reported in 2002 that showed an increased risk of breast cancer from such HRT, few women take them any more anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more interesting is how Kolata correctly points out just how little diet and other lifestyle factors seem to matter compared to our hopes. If anyone wants to counter the claims of woo-meisters that we evil “allopathic” doctors don’t pay attention to diet and lifestyle, one only needs to look at just how much money has been spent on studies of diet and exercise and how they impact cancer and heart disease. There have been many studies. Of course, it’s incredibly difficult to do a randomized study, particularly a double-blinded one, of diet and exercise; so most of them end up being observational. The problem with such studies is, as with all such cohort studies, controlling for confounders. It’s hard enough to control for confounders that the investigators know about, but there are often many confounders that they don’t know about and may not identify until after the study is over. In any case, suffice it to say that studies of diet as a means of preventing cancer have been disappointing of late, as Kolata points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, public health experts for years recommended eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day to prevent cancer, but the evidence is conflicting, at best suggestive, and far from definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-fat diets were long thought to prevent breast cancer. But a large federal study randomizing women to a low-fat or normal diet and looking for an effect in breast cancer found nothing, said its director, Ross L. Prentice of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber, found in fruits, vegetables and grains, is often thought to prevent colon cancer, even though two large studies found no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought we would show relationships that were strong and true,” said Dr. Tim Byers, professor of epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health, “particularly for dietary choices and food and vegetable intake. Now we have settled into thinking they are important but it’s not like saying you can cut your risk in half or three-quarters.” Others wonder whether even such qualified support is misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a reason the research disappointed, said Colin B. Begg, chairman of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Perhaps the crucial time to intervene is early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s one possibility,” Dr. Begg said. “The other is that it’s all sort of nonsense to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential reason for these results is that the effect of diet or other environmental exposures may have a “window of vulnerability” that occurs in youth or childhood. Certainly, in the breast cancer field, we are starting to think that and actively research the possibility. The problem is, if that’s true, then dietary interventions during adulthood may have little or no effect on ultimate cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to drugs and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolata mentions the cautionary tales of beta-carotene and selenium, the former of which was thought to prevent cancer and the latter to prevent prostate cancer. However, when a large study of beta carotene was done, not only did the supplement not prevent cancer but it appeared to &lt;a href="http://atbcstudy.cancer.gov/"&gt;increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers&lt;/a&gt;. Selenium and vitamin E similarly were found to have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/another_one_bites_the_dust_clinical_tria.php"&gt;no protective impact on prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and, in fact, the trial studying the question was halted because there was a hint of actually increased risk. Even so, as Kolata points out, ads for such supplements continue to imply, with the Quack Miranda warning, that such supplements “improve prostate health,” whatever that means, although the implication is that they decrease the risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s where the drugs come in. Because I’m a breast cancer surgeon, I’m going to focus mainly on strategies to prevent breast cancer. It turns out that tamoxifen can decrease the risk of breast cancer by 50% in high risk women. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that antagonizes estrogen action in breast tissues but has partial agonist activity in bone and endometrium. Indeed, raloxifene, another SERM, is used primarily to prevent and treat bone loss in women with osteoporosis. A $110 million clinical trial showed that its ability to prevent breast cancer is not statistically significantly different than that of tamoxifen, with the advantage that, unlike tamoxifen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of uterine cancer and does not increase the risk of blood clots as much as tamoxifen does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with such overwhelming evidence that in women at high risk for breast cancer, why is it that so few are offered the option of tamoxifen or raloxifene? Kolata explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those were your tax dollars and mine,” he [Dr. Victor Vogel] added. “You can’t do too many $110 million studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cannot understand why no one cares, but some doctors say they see a number of problems. It is usually not the cost; tamoxifen is about 30 cents a day and raloxifene $3.30 a day. It is doctors’ practices and women’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most doctors, said Dr. Therese B. Bevers, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at M. D. Anderson, do not take the first step — calculating a woman’s lifetime risk of getting breast cancer — in part because that can lead to the next step, spending an hour or so discussing cancer risk and drug risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bevers suggests the drugs for women whose lifetime odds exceeds 20 percent. That could include, for example, a 55-year-old woman who began menstruating early (increasing the risk), had her first child late (again increasing the risk), and whose mother and sister got breast cancer. About half the time, though, women with that kind of risk turn down the drugs, Dr. Bevers said. “The No. 1 reason I hear is, ‘Oh, I just don’t like to take medications,’ ” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the same women will happily down supplements that woo-meisters like Dr. Mercola or Mike Adams will suggest to them as cancer preventing. Some will down many supplements a day without thinking twice about it, even though there is no good evidence that they do anything other than enrich the supplement manufacturers who make them and they often cost far more than the paltry 30 cents a day that tamoxifen costs. Moreover, in general for prevention the usual course of tamoxifen or raloxifene is five years, in marked contrast to supplements, where the woo-meisters recommend them for the rest of one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, never having worked anywhere else other than NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers, I am probably spoiled in this respect. Such centers always have genetic counseling and prevention clinics. I can simply refer suitable patients there, where our trusty and excellent genetic counselors will calculate patients’ lifetime risk of breast cancer, construct family trees, decide if testing for cancer susceptibility genes is appropriate, and then make science-based recommendations for risk prevention strategies and/or screening strategies tailored to the individual patient. (Who says “allopathic medicine” doesn’t individualize therapy?) In any case, I can see why primary care doctors don’t bring these issues up more often, but with the advent of genetic counseling clinics I am puzzled why more patients aren’t referred to a specialist for these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem mentioned in the article is that there aren’t any particularly good biomarkers for increased risk for cancer, especially ones that fall in response to preventative interventions, the way, for example, cholesterol does for heart disease. Another is what I mentioned earlier, namely that cancer is not one disease, meaning that it is likely that many drugs would be needed to prevent various cancers. True, for the really common cancers, like prostate, breast, and colon, it might be worth it to develop such drugs, but neither the risk-benefit profile nor the number of patients who would benefit would be likely to lead to such drugs for less common cancers. And, as has been pointed out, our risk assessment tools are currently crude at best. In fact, even with better biomarkers I’m not so sure that interest would improve because biomarkers have their own problems and many people have a tendency to fear pharmaceuticals more than they fear a hypothetical increased risk of cancer. In the case of drugs that prevent breast cancer, nearly all of them have anti-estrogen activities and thus produce side effects of estrogen deprivation, such as hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. It’s a very high bar to meet to produce effective drugs that people will actually take, given that it’s hard enough to persuade patients to comply with drugs designed to treat actual diseases and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of all of this is that drug companies, once interested in developing cancer preventing drugs, are now floundering. As Kolata notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But risk assessment is not easy, and biomarkers are still more of a dream than a reality. There are other problems, too. If each cancer requires a different drug for prevention, how many drugs can a person take? For now, Dr. Curt said, the very idea of cancer prevention is daunting. And since cancer can take decades to develop, by the time a study concludes, a drug’s patent life may be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a pretty picture, Dr. Vogel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to think that in boardrooms they are saying, Man, did we learn a lesson,” he said. “We will stay as far away as possible from cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, supplement manufacturers are not faced with such problems because they don’t actually have to demonstrate that their supplements have the health effects that they claim they have. The war against cancer goes on, but one weapon is not being developed.&lt;/p&gt;

The shuttle is waiting patiently about three miles away. It is fueled up, and ready to go. In the last 15 minutes the sky went from completely overcast to patchy sun to brilliant blue sky with a few puffy clouds. We are now 2:58:22 from launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/11/danielandrisa_space_shuttle-300x225.jpg" alt="daniel &amp;amp; risa before space shuttle atlantis launch" title="daniel &amp;amp; risa before space shuttle atlantis launch" width="300" height="225"&gt;To be honest, I’m surprised by how excited I am. Yesterday we toured the facilities at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;, and got to see the shuttle up close. It is impressive. Of course, it’s huge. But it’s hard to wrap one’s mind around the simple essential fact: this object is going into space! However, there’s something more primal about all this. I think every kid growing up since the 60s (and presumably well before?) must have had an “obsession with rockets” phase. What could possibly be cooler? They are huge. They go really, really, really fast. They make loud noises. They go exotic places. They are the perfect vehicles for a child’s imagination. As we grow up, most of us lose our fixation. But, as I’ve found out in the last 24 hours, it hasn’t been lost, only misplaced. When you actually see a rocket about to head into space, it’s a completely overwhelming experience. All those emotions come roaring back, and you’re left mesmerized and excited and giddy, just like you were as a 10 year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just took a little break and walked down to wave to the astronauts. They are in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrovan"&gt;astrovan&lt;/a&gt;, an (entirely appropriate, completely antiquated) airstream motorhome. They stopped briefly to say goodbye. Their next stop is the shuttle (and then &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"&gt;300 km up&lt;/a&gt;). You might think that this is just part of a media stunt, a final wave for the cameras. But, at the end of the day, these six individuals are about to strap themselves to the top of 1.2 million kg of liquid oxygen/hydrogen (by my calculations, the equivalent of 0.7 kilotons of TNT—a “small” nuclear bomb). This is not all just fun and games; it is a deadly serious enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now 1:53:33 from launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students working on a case now known as the ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/journalism/undergrad/page.aspx?id=59507"&gt;Medill Innocence Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘ uncovered evidence suggesting a man named Anthony McKinney has been wrongfully incarcerated for 31 years over the slaying of a security guard (&lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-oped1104pittsnov04,0,6284763.column"&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;). After their investigation ended in 2006, the findings were published on the project’s &lt;a href="http://www.medillinnocenceproject.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and informed a 2008 front-page piece in &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;. As a result, Northwestern Law School’s Center on Wrongful Convictions filed a petition for a new hearing on behalf of McKinney. Although students have already turned over videotaped interviews and affidavits for the case, state prosecutors want more. They issued a subpoena for e-mails, grades, expense reports, and other course materials to explore whether there was “bias, motive and interest” in the project. Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez claims students are ineligible for the privilege to protect their sources because they did not write the articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait a second… it sure doesn’t seem right to be &lt;em&gt;interrogating&lt;/em&gt; investigators. In the &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/judge-h-lee-sarokin/gestapo-knocks-at-door-of_b_333045.html"&gt;Judge H. Lee Sarokin&lt;/a&gt; goes so far as to compare the subpoena to tactics employed by the Gestapo, pointing out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor here were seeking incriminating (rather than exonerating) evidence derived from the student interviews..their purpose, but not necessarily their legal position, would be justified and acceptable. But the effort to investigate the students themselves warrants that [Gestapo] label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/business/media/16carr.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;ref=business"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has more on why &lt;em&gt;The Innocence Project&lt;/em&gt; is fighting the subpoena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Protess..is incensed by the prosecutor’s tactical aggression toward his students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you can’t attack the message, you attack the messenger,” Professor  Protess said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that prosecutors and other public officials see that much of the investigative reporting is coming out of nonprofits and are beginning to take aim at them,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be right. The record of Protess’ students makes it clear that they are engaged in significant journalism that has been recognized and applauded around the country. Therefore, in my opinion there is no question they should be entitled to protect sources and materials related to the investigation.

And though I didn’t plan it in advance, I blurted out something that I think really does apply here: Vaccine denialism might be considered a form of &lt;em&gt;decadence&lt;/em&gt;–one that our society can only countenance in the first place thanks to the tremendous prior triumphs of vaccination efforts. (You can see the segment where I make the point &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/23859?in=03:58&amp;amp;out=10:46"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for the decadence interpretation, it seems to me, is bolstered by the fact that it is generally liberal elites and celebrities, rather than poor folks or the disadvantaged, who feel empowered to attack vaccination and try to shirk it. In the context of human history and the past century, these people are surfing atop a wave of prosperity and scientific advancement that has given them marvelously prosperous and pleasant lives. There’s simply no way they could deny vaccination if vaccination hadn’t already delivered a world where the measles, the mumps, polio, and so on, are &lt;em&gt;seemingly&lt;/em&gt; nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionary.com gives &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decadence"&gt;this third definition&lt;/a&gt; of “decadence”: “unrestrained or excessive self-indulgence.” I might have added “costly” or even “dangerous” for the vaccine case in particular–but yeah, that’s the general picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it seems a safe assumption that the indulgence will end quickly indeed if vaccine-vanquished diseases start coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258388348815"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/early_medieval_magnates_talk_i.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93e80be6fd5327f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Early Medieval Magnates Talk in Lund</title><published>2009-11-25T13:07:27Z</published><updated>2009-11-25T13:07:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/_I9m4RbiTrs/early_medieval_magnates_talk_i.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/early_medieval_magnates_talk_i.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I finished a book manuscript on elite settlement and political geography in Östergötland, one of Sweden's core provinces, in the period AD 375-1000. In countries that have experienced an infestation of Romans, this era is known as the Early Middle Ages. In Scandyland we call it the Late Iron Age. Researching and writing the book has been my main project for over four years, as reflected in many blog entries here about sites such as Skamby in Kuddby and Sättuna in Kaga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday 26 November at 15:00 I will give a talk about these matters at the Dept of Archaeology at the University of Lund, Sandgatan 1. I'm sure there will be room for some interested members of the public. Do show up if you're into things like this -- I promise it won't be dry and academic.

They're OK, but not as good as the first book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science fiction is of course stories where fabulous things happen and are explained by science and technology rather than magic. There are two ways to do this: either you offer an explanation that is actually in line with what we know now and sort of makes sense, or you use technobabble to cover the fact that you, the writer, do not actually have any idea of how for instance space ships move instantaneously from one star to another. Both ways are in my opinion fine. And Simmons uses the technobabble technique with poetic flair: "torch ship", "lance the ground troops from orbit", "spin down into the system", "hyper-entropic field".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the third of the Hyperion novels, &lt;em&gt;Endymion&lt;/em&gt; (1996), he does something that jarred me awake to the fact that Simmons apparently does not know basic science at all. He tells us that a couple of fabulous things happen and offers neither technobabble nor believable scientific explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're on the planet Sol Draconi Septem. Having once been terraformed, thus receiving a breathable atmosphere, it has now relapsed (over a few centuries) into a chilly state where its atmosphere has frozen solid, collapsed onto the surface and formed glaciers. There is hardly any gaseous matter there any more. Those glaciers seem to consist largely of solid nitrogen. Yet Simmons tells us that there is breathable air and liquid salty water in tunnels dug through the ice by a species of large animal, the ice wraiths. And on top of the glaciers, where it is impossible to breathe, intense blizzards blow. So there is wind in a vacuum, and there is precipitation without an atmosphere. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecology of Sol Draconi Septem is also magical. It consists only of two species of carnivore that hunt each other: ice wraiths and humans. No plants and no herbivores. Simmons does mention that the human population is shrinking, which suggests that he understands that a system without energy input will dwindle and eventually stop running. But as far as I can see he's vastly overestimated the longevity of such a system. It is after all the equivalent of fencing a desert in, removing all animals and filling it with lions and tigers. And it's not just a matter of energy efficiency, but also one of materials: if a tiger eats a lion, far from all of the lion's building blocks become incorporated into the tiger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other skeptic-themed podcasts up for awards in various categories. (Skeptoid under People’s Choice category, Scam School under Best Video Podcast category, and Skepticallity under Science category.) Please cast votes for our skeptical brethren along with us. Astronomy Cast is only in the same category as us, so if you’d like to spread the love, send Astronomy Cast some votes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is great to see that science and skepticism is recognized so well in the podcasting community. As we continue to ride the crest of the Web 2.0 wave, let’s hope that more of our colleagues will be recognized for their excellent content and contributions to the global skeptical community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258388261996"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/cancer_prevention_drugs_supplements_and.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a77ff02572e45db9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Cancer prevention drugs, supplements, and a false dichotomy</title><published>2009-11-16T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/aTR21oD4W98/cancer_prevention_drugs_supplements_and.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/cancer_prevention_drugs_supplements_and.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has been periodically running a &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/series/forty_years_war/"&gt;series about the "40 years' war" on cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with most articles by Gina Kolata. I've touched on this series before, liking some parts of it, while others not so much. In particular, I criticized an article one article that I thought to be so misguided about how the NIH grant system leads researchers to "play it safe" and how we could cure cancer if we could just fund "riskier" research that I had to write an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/are_we_playing_it_too_safe_in_cancer_res.php"&gt;extended screed&lt;/a&gt; about the misconceptions in the article. The latest installment, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/health/research/13prevent.html"&gt;Medicines to Deter Some Cancers Are Not Taken&lt;/a&gt;, also by Kolata, is much better in that it discusses a problem at the heart of cancer, namely that we have developed drugs that can decrease the risk of specific cancers but they are not as widely used as they could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/health/research/13prevent.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; contrasts a seeming incongruity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many Americans do not think twice about taking medicines to prevent heart disease and stroke. But cancer is different. Much of what Americans do in the name of warding off cancer has not been shown to matter, and some things are actually harmful. Yet the few medicines proved to deter cancer are widely ignored.

&lt;p&gt;Take prostate cancer, the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, surpassed only by easily treated skin cancers. More than 192,000 cases of it will be diagnosed this year, and more than 27,000 men will die from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, it turns out, there is a way to prevent many cases of prostate cancer. A large and rigorous study found that a generic drug, finasteride, costing about $2 a day, could prevent as many as 50,000 cases each year. Another study found that finasteride's close cousin, dutasteride, about $3.50 a day, has the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a contrast. Think about it. Millions of Americans take statins, for instance, to lower their cholesterol and thereby try to prevent the complications of elevated cholesterol, such as heart disease, vascular disease, and strokes. Yet, for at least two common cancers, there are proven effective drugs that will lower the risk of cancer considerably with a side effect profile at least as favorable as that of statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/cancer_prevention_drugs_supplements_and.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/cancer_prevention_drugs_supplements_and.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/aTR21oD4W98" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258387868884"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Neurodojo/~3/hFtuxoqYZJw/how-to-act-when-you-might-be-eaten.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/54da261d67701876</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">How to act when you might be eaten</title><published>2009-11-16T08:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T08:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/5kDLJSAYMIo/how-to-act-when-you-might-be-eaten.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Neurodojo/~3/hFtuxoqYZJw/how-to-act-when-you-might-be-eaten.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;If you don’t have to worry about reproduction, life gets a little simpler.

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sv84MC-X8dI/AAAAAAAACd8/TDv61xXE3kU/s1600-h/Aspidoscelis_uniparens.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sv84MC-X8dI/AAAAAAAACd8/TDv61xXE3kU/s200/Aspidoscelis_uniparens.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aspidoscelis uniparens&lt;/i&gt; is a parthenogenetic whiptail lizard (formerly &lt;i&gt;Cnemidophorus uniparens&lt;/i&gt;), and Eifler and colleagues tested how they allocated their time under threat. To do they, they made six large enclosures (225 square meters) and put in six of these small lizards in. In half of these, they also included two leopard lizards, which prey on the smaller one. In fact, the leopard lizards successfully caught a couple of the subjects during the experiment. Unfortunately, the authors describe the predators in much less detail than the whiptails, which make it a bit difficult to interpret their findings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sv85eaXOXxI/AAAAAAAACeE/zJSeg2xdO-o/s1600-h/Gambelia_wislizenii.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sv85eaXOXxI/AAAAAAAACeE/zJSeg2xdO-o/s200/Gambelia_wislizenii.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The whiptails, not surprisingly, act differently when enclosed with the leopard lizards. They spend a less time moving when housed with leopard lizards, and they’re visible less often to human observers. The whiptails also seem to shift their activity more towards the early hours of the morning (say, 7:00 am), seemingly because the leopard lizards’ activity starts to pick up around 8:00 am.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But the whiptails didn’t change their behaviour as much as much as you might think. time spent in vegetation? Time spent digging? How fast the whiptails move? No differences between the control enclosures and the predator encloses. These are small animals, only a few centimeters long, in a very big, natural enclosure with lots of places to hide. There’s not really any way to predict how “worried” the whiptails would have to be – that is, how strong the predator cues would have to be – for them to start changing their behaviour more dramatically, or to even start changing them at all.&lt;br&gt;

I don't deny that it's hard work and is a kind of achievement, but it's not &lt;i&gt;education&lt;/i&gt; — it doesn&amp;#39;t teach people how to think for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I find this story about &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/13/AR2009111303900.html?hpid=sec-religion"&gt;kids memorizing the Bible&lt;/a&gt; rather dismaying. These are clearly kids with brains, discipline, and a kind of warped ambition, who have the potential to do interesting things, and our Christian leaders have apparently seen some virtue in the madrassas model, so they've got them engaged in the pointless and backwards-looking exercise of Bible drills. It's such a waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it's all-American and thoroughly capitalist. The winner of the Bible bee got $100,000. I only hope he takes the money and uses it to get a good secular education so he can do something &lt;i&gt;productive&lt;/i&gt; with his mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/our_american_madrassas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jHb2ebNRjmE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258387230188"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/the_uk_needs_more_god-botherer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5a23afad1169aa4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The UK needs more god-botherers advising the government</title><published>2009-11-16T14:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T14:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/m-DBQFkL-S0/the_uk_needs_more_god-botherer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/the_uk_needs_more_god-botherer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;That seems to be the idea behind &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6569144/Faith-groups-to-be-key-policy-advisers.html"&gt;forming a council of key policy advisors&lt;/a&gt;, whose qualifications seem to be the fervency of their obeisance to an invisible man in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move has been criticised by secularists who warned that it represented a worrying development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, Mr Denham argued that Christians and Muslims can contribute significant insights on key issues, such as the economy, parenting and tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, really? How? I suppose tithing and refusing to allow money to be lent at interest are a &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of economic strategy…just not a very productive one. And I don&amp;#39;t quite see the point of consulting with a gang of grisly old virgins on parenting, or asking some bearded imam whose chief talent is the memorization of the Koran about what to do about carbon emissions. I wish Mr Denham had gone on with some specifics that he hopes superstition can address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does have a few general platitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Faith is a strong and powerful source of honesty, solidarity, generosity - the very values which are essential to politics, to our economy and our society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, I see. I had no idea how different the government of the UK was from the government of the US. Here, honesty and generosity aren&amp;#39;t exactly common currency in government, or at least are in conflict. I suppose one could argue that Washington has been very generous to defense contractors, but they aren&amp;#39;t very forthright about it. I suppose there are principles of solidarity at work, with our most religious party, the Republicans, being monolithic in their opposition to equality, social support, and science, and Democrats straining to achieve some kind of unity — maybe they&amp;#39;d benefit from religious rigidity, too. I suppose if the UK government did model their political system after the Muslims and Christians, they could end up with a nice, pretty political system like ours, with Republicans and Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Denham should look more closely at our system. For instance, maybe he could pop over for the &lt;a href="http://www.boldfreshtour.com/"&gt;Bold Fresh Tour&lt;/a&gt;, and see how a couple of paragons of the idea of using religious principles in government represent honesty, solidarity, and generosity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/the_uk_needs_more_god-botherer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/m-DBQFkL-S0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258387178633"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4553617825394350025">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e443750cf8def123</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Bill Maher on Vaccination</title><published>2009-11-16T14:40:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T14:40:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/11/bill-maher-on-vaccination.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/SwFxx8lFTcI/AAAAAAAAKWc/TmyJ05QhkMc/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:300px;height:360px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/SwFxx8lFTcI/AAAAAAAAKWc/TmyJ05QhkMc/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bill Maher has attempted to clarify his position on vaccination [&lt;a href="http://therealbillmaher.blogspot.com/2009/11/vaccination-conversation-worth-having.html"&gt;Vaccination: A Conversation Worth Having&lt;/a&gt;]. His blog is a lot like his TV show. It's a confusing, rambling, attempt at justifying an indefensible position using (attempted) humor, sarcasm and anecdote as a substitute for rationalism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is whether vaccinations are good or bad. It's a strictly scientific question with a well-known scientific answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I can tell, these are Bill Maher's main reasons for opposing vaccinations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You wouldn't need to have vaccinations if you had a healthy immune system to begin with. (And I'm sure he has some opinions on what you should eat to ensure a healthy immune system.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The success of vaccinations has been exaggerated by the medical community but he's not accusing anyone of a conspiracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccines have bad things in them and they may be harmful to healthy people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinations are supported by drug companies and you need to be skeptical about anything that's supported by large for-profit corporations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm just trying to represent an under-reported medical point of view in this country, I'm not telling a specific pregnant lady what to do. With unlimited air time, I would have, for example, added to my discussion with Dr. Bill Frist on October 2 that, yes, any flu or health challenge can be dangerous when you're pregnant, and if your immune system is already compromised by, for example, eating a typical American diet, then a flu shot can make sense. But someone needs to be representing the point of view that says the preferred way to handle flus is to have a strong immune system to begin with, and getting lots of vaccines might not be the best way to accomplish that over the long haul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, sometimes its OK to fuck with nature -- I believe "intelligent design" is often anything but intelligent; that "God's perfect universe" is actually full of fuck ups and design flaws, like cleft lips and Down Syndrome -- so correcting nature is sometimes the right thing to do. And then, sometimes its not. For me, the flu shot is in the "not" category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, my audience is bright, they wouldn't refuse a flu shot because they heard me talk about it, but if they looked into the subject a little more, how is that a bad thing? If they went to the CDC Web site and saw what's in the vaccine -- the formaldehyde, the insect repellent, the mercury -- shouldn't they at least get to have the information for themselves?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Instead of setting up this straw man of me not understanding germs or viruses, let's have a real debate about how much we should use vaccines and antibiotics. Of course it's good that we have them in our arsenal, but isn't the real skeptic the one who asks if these powerful but toxic methods do harm to what actually is a a very good defensive system, the one you were born with?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I have never said there was a medical conspiracy. In fact, when Howard Dean asked me that, my response was "I wouldn't call it a conspiracy." Any more than there's a conspiracy for the Pentagon budget to be obscenely bloated and operated largely for the corporate welfare of defense contractors. If these are conspiracies, they're mostly legal ones that happen in plain sight. (Good time here to plug the hostess' book, Pigs At the Trough, it's all in there!) I have, in fact, used the phrase "medical-pharmaceutical-food industry" complex in comparing it to Eisenhower's famous depiction of a "military-industrial complex."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I believe in science and I believe in studies to determine the truth. I also believe Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon was correct when he said recently on MSNBC: "If you've got a checkbook in this town, you can get just about any set of facts you want." So if I remind you of a conspiracy theorist, you sometimes remind me of Britney Spears when she said "we should just do whatever the president says to do, and not ask questions and just support him." The medical community can be brutal on dissent, which would hold more weight if I thought this was a terribly healthy country, which it isn't. Health care is one sixth of our economy, and we spend way more on it than any other nation. The elephant in the room of the health care debate is that we are going to have a high health care bill every year no matter what law they pass because we're sick -- we need a lot of drugs and services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I a conspiracy theorist if I suggest that since the network's nightly news broadcasts are sponsored almost entirely by prescription drug ads, that you might have to hold your breath a long time before you hear the alternative point of view to using pharmaceuticals to cure all our ailments?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it conspiracy theory to believe that American medicine too much treats symptoms and not root causes of disease? I always ask my friends when they go to the doctor for something, "Did your doctor ask you what you eat?" The answer is almost always 'no,' and a lot can be cured with diet and a healthier lifestyle. (And a lot can't. I also understand the role of genetics and generations of artificial selection). But Americans don't want to hear that, so doctors don't push it. It's easier and more profitable to write a prescription for Lipitor. They're not bad people, and at the end of the day, you can't make someone eat right. I like and respect all the M.D.s I've had over the years, and for the record, I have a naturopath doctor and I have a Western doctor. I would make an analogy to Republicans and Democrats: in both politics and health, I don't commit to either party because I'm on the side of the truth, whoever has it. In both cases, I'm an Independent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This last quotation is the most revealing of all. Bill Maher listens to his naturopath doctor and feels competent to distinguish the truth when his quack doctor disagrees with evidence-based medicine (e.g. "Western" medicine).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to falling for quackery, Bill Maher is making an elementary error in logic. Yes, it's true there are problems with modern medicine and the influence of drug companies, especially in the USA. But that's not to be confused with a rational discussion about the value of vaccinations. The scientific judgment about whether vaccinations are good or bad is independent of any opinions you might have about conspiracies, imagined or otherwise. The real question isn't about drug companies, it's whether you accept science or quackery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientific evaluation of vaccination takes place in many countries throughout the world, including those with socialized medicine. They have all concluded that vaccinations are a proven technology that prevents disease.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hat Tip and Thank-you to &lt;i&gt;esaul&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-4553617825394350025?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258386592111"><id gr:original-id="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/11/16/on-being-systematic">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f51579051d76d1b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">On being systematic</title><published>2009-11-16T15:42:17Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T15:42:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/11/16/on-being-systematic" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over on another &lt;del&gt;planet&lt;/del&gt; blog Darren Saunders asks what is an &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/scurry/blog/2009/11/12/pronto-pre-print#comment-47016"&gt;Associate Faculty Member&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span&gt;AFM&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some sales training on this subject last week and I sat in, so I should know. I’ve also been re-writing the FAQs for the new f1000 website and have just realized that there isn’t an &lt;span&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt; relating to AFMs there, either. (Meta: how many times does a question have to be asked before it becomes ‘frequent’?) So, let’s have a stab at explaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, what Faculty of 1000 does is publish short reviews of the scientific (currently biology and medicine) literature. How this works is through our eponymous Faculty of over 5000 top scientists and medics, all over the world. These people are principle investigator level or higher. When they read a paper that they consider interesting, important, or otherwise worthy of wider recognition they write a review (or ‘evaluation’), assign a score (or rating) to the original article, and submit it to our editorial team (usually via a web interface). The piece is then edited in the usual way, coded to appropriate sections (i.e. sub-disciplines), and published on the website at f1000biology.com or f1000medicine.com, depending on the specialty of the contributing Faculty Member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system has been pretty successful for a few years now, and we know that people really like the service (because they tell us!). It lets scientists and medics see very quickly what’s happening in their own field, and rapidly get at what’s considered important in other communities (whether simply out of interest or because they’re moving into unfamiliar territory). Identifying important papers quickly and easily gauging the opinion of a field easily are not trivial tasks: f1000 is intended to help everyone, from students through to vice-chancellors, achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, choice of articles to review is left entirely to the Faculty, and may come from any journal. &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; journal: even the &lt;a href="http://f1000medicine.com/article/id/1161277"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally there are a high proportion of articles from the usual suspects—&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEJM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, etc.—although about 80% come from ‘second tier’ or less popular journals (he says, desparately avoiding the ‘I’ word).You might expect this, seeing as certain journals review editorially before a paper goes anywhere near peer review, and actually are quite successful at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, we don’t care about the providence of the articles reviewed at f1000. If they’re good, we want to know (and ‘good’ means 1-2% of the current eligible literature). However, there are a lot of journals publishing good stuff, and how do we know we’re scanning the right ones if we’re just leaving it to serendipitous reading by the Faculty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the Associate Faculty. Currently about a thousand Faculty Members have one or more Associates: less senior members of their lab or practice (which can mean anything from a post-doc to a PI in their own right). Once a month we send these Associates a table of contents from two journals: one general, one ‘specific’; both self-nominated. The Associate checks the table against their own reading, and selects articles &lt;em&gt;that they have already read&lt;/em&gt; that they will review. They also let us know if there are any articles that they think should be reviewed but that they will not do themselves: these then go into a ‘pot’ which we send (a couple of weeks later) to Associates who haven’t committed to producing a review that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Associate commits to reviewing an article, it’s pretty much between them and their Faculty Member as to how it’s handled. Sometimes the Associate will do the bulk of the writing, other times the Faculty Member will. In either case, the full Faculty Member has to approve the evaluation and has final say—they are the corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cover, at the last count, about 660 journals in this fashion. We’ve asked the Faculty to tell us what journals they think should be scanned in this scheme, and eventually we’ll be covering over a thousand different journals. This does not mean that we won’t be evaluating articles outwith this ‘core’ of journals: Faculty Members have complete freedom to evaluate papers regardless of where they are published. Our Associate Faculty help them identify the good stuff, and we help &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to choose by providing the tables of content with a selection system (somewhat arcane, but we are working on it). The buzzphrase is ‘systematic and comprehensive’: we’re certainly systematic and are working on the comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope that clears some things up for Darren.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Richard Grant</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/posts.rss</id><title type="html">Confessions of a (former) Lab Rat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258385948305"><id gr:original-id="http://physiology-physics.blogspot.com/2009/11/tale-of-microprocessor-risc-and-few.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/628a5ef99eaa7947</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">A Tale of a Microprocessor, RISC and a Few Loops of miRNA</title><published>2009-11-16T08:42:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T08:42:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/-8s7AqsyI7s/tale-of-microprocessor-risc-and-few.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://physiology-physics.blogspot.com/2009/11/tale-of-microprocessor-risc-and-few.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The word ‘microprocessor’ is generally used to designate VLSI and SLSI (Very/Super Large Scale Integrated circuits) devices which accept, decode and execute instructions presented in binary coded forms. They may be called the heart of the computer. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), on the other hand, is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a simplified, yet highly-optimized set of instructions to deliver good performance. However, like ‘cell’ and ‘nucleus’, they too have been adopted in biology, and not without reason!Proteins are essential for cells as they perform various functions as enzymes, ion channels, receptors and so on. They are manufactured in the ribosomes, organelles present in the cytoplasm, under the instruction of messenger RNA (mRNA). This instruction code is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides that make the mRNA molecule. However, the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is dictated in turn by the DNA that is present in the nucleus. Messenger RNA carries this message from the nucleus into the protein production units. But what would happen if we interfered with the ‘message’?RNA interference (RNAi) would occur affecting the regulation of gene expression. Micro RNAs (miRNA) are one of the small RNAs that regulate the expression of protein-encoding-genes, after the mRNA strand has formed. miRNAs have partly or fully complementary sequence to one or more mRNAs. This enables them to latch on to the mRNA molecule masking the ‘instruction codes’ in the mRNA strand, interfering with protein formation (translation). In other words, the gene has been silenced!miRNAs are first transcribed from DNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase II into primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). pri miRNA is then cleaved by another enzyme, RNAse III, called Drosha, into precursor miRNA (pre miRNA) (see the picture on the left). However, Drosha (an RNAase III endonuclease) is assisted by Pasha (partner of Drosha), another enzyme, in this task. Later, it was found out that these two resided in a 500 kilo Dalton complex, called the microprocessor (micro RNA processor). So far, all these have been happening in the nucleus of the cell. The pre miRNA then moves into the cytoplasm through the exportin 5 pathway. Next, Dicer, another RNase III endonuclease, makes a mature miRNA duplex, which is then ‘uploaded’ into a complex called RISC (RNA induced silencing complex). RISC then prevents translation of the mRNA strand, as the ‘partially’ complementary miRNA strand interferes with the translation of the mRNA molecule into specified amino acid sequences can not occur. We can compare complementarity of nucleotide bases in terms of a pair of gloves and its corresponding fingers. The information of the gloves&amp;#39; coordinates gets obliterated by the occupying fingers. This RISC dependent mechanism occurs in parts of the cytoplasm, called P bodies (‘p’ for processing).RNAi is very important for plants as they lack an immune system. Invading organisms can not dictate foreign protein formations as their RNAs are destroyed, not merely inhibited, as is usually seen in higher animals (animal miRNAs exhibit only imperfect homology to the mRNA in contrast to plants, and thus they only inhibit translation). Some of the tumor suppressor genes inhibit tumor formation by the action of miRNAs and not through protein formation. In humans, exploiting RNAi may be a useful tool in combating diseases such as cancer, AIDS etc. So it remains to be seen whether the microprocessor can bring a revolution in medicine and research as its counterpart in electronics did in the field of computing.Last modified: neverReference: Saumet, A., &amp;amp; Lecellier, C.

The trouble is, the study doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, in its meagre entirety, goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted in the United States showed that women with big breasts are smarter than those who are less endowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a Singapore newspaper article, Sin Chew Daily revealed that the study was aimed to find out whether the size of a woman’s bust affected her brainpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by a female researcher in Chicago, involved 1,200 women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects were divided into five groups, from extra small to extra big, reports The Star Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study speculated that such women were smarter due to the higher level of female hormones that could result in better development in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating things about the internet is that with a simple search we can track memes over time, and googling some of the details brings up some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this &lt;a href="http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/skraablikk/article159726.ece?execute=viewComments"&gt;Swedish newspaper story&lt;/a&gt; from November 28th, 2003 - that's six years ago - gives us some more details, including the name of the researcher, sociologist Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, and brilliantly manages to reference &lt;em&gt;'Einsteins relativitetsteori'&lt;/em&gt;, which makes me wish I'd paid attention in Swedish lessons in school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/imagecache/Medium/manboobs.JPG" width="450" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Can Einstein's relativitetsteori explain these?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By January 2004, the story had apparently made its way&lt;a href="http://big-boobs.blogspot.com/"&gt; onto Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;, although the original link appears to be broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...we found that women with big busts average 10 IQ points higher than less well-endowed women," reveals lead researcher Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, herself a meager 32A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is tantalising evidence that the story appeared in Mens' Health magazine by 2006 (&lt;a href="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html" title="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html"&gt;http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html&lt;/a&gt;), although again the link appears to be broken. That same year, one &lt;a href="http://personals.villagevoice.com/blog/1130/post_9474.html?dcb=personals.villagevoice.com"&gt;over-excited poster&lt;/a&gt; on Village Voice even speculates that this phenomenon could explain why America leads the world: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"American women have the largest breasts in the world and our nation's breasts have been increasing in volume with each generation. According to a recent report, the average U.S. cup size has ballooned to an impressive C. That, the sociologists speculate, may explain why the United States leads the world in science and technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the original study is nowhere to be found, which is not surprising because Yvonne Rossdale doesn't appear to exist, which is in itself not surprising because as the Swedish newspaper article reveals, the very first mention of this study anywhere comes from the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TfMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA10&amp;amp;lpg=PA10&amp;amp;dq=%22Dr.+Yvonne+Rossdale%22+iq&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ZouwuZDp2F&amp;amp;sig=nHTWBWlAKNZzfMJb4gMIsv2dRsQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=cxoAS7ScHsT64Abyk5HtCw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Dr.%20Yvonne%20Rossdale%22%20iq&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;November 4th, 2003 edition&lt;/a&gt; of Weekly World News. An edition whose front page carries the EXCLUSIVE story that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein have secretly adopted a shaved monkey baby together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn1.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn2.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right folks, the study &lt;a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001561/2003/11/28.html"&gt;was a spoof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things about this story that are genuinely fascinating, and quite important for science communication. The first is how in the name of God this study ended up in any newspaper in the first place - what kind of mind picks up an edition of Weekly World News, skips past the haunted VCR and the shaved monkey baby, and decides that they've found a real piece of science worth sharing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, equally troubling question is why so many newspapers and magazines around the world are willing to simply regurgitate stories without apparently stopping to do even the most basic fact-checking. When picking up a story reporting research by "Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, a sociologist from the University of Chicago", a journalist should at the very least Google her name, and preferably actually contact her to verify the story. That is, after all, what the job of a journalist is &lt;em&gt;supposed to be&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge can travel the modern world in an instant, but unfortunately, nobody thought to add any checks to ensure that the knowledge was correct. As a result, apparently half of Asia now believe that big-breasted women have higher IQs. That's quite funny, until you realize that by the same process, parents in south Africa now believe the MMR vaccine causes autism, resulting in the recent deaths of four children from an easily preventable childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the information age, ignorance moves at light-speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;An eclectic essayist is necessarily a dilettante, which is not in itself a bad thing. But Gladwell frequently holds forth about statistics and psychology, and his lack of technical grounding in these subjects can be jarring. He provides misleading definitions of “homology,” “saggital plane” and “power law” and quotes an expert speaking about an “igon value” (that’s eigenvalue, a basic concept in linear algebra). In the spirit of Gladwell, who likes to give portentous names to his aperçus, I will call this the &lt;strong&gt;Igon Value Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: when a writer’s education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of creative lexicography, I plan to be on the look-out for future opportunities to refer to the &lt;em&gt;Igon Value Problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gladwell uses "igon value" in an inessential way, to provide some local color in the chapter of &lt;em&gt;What the Dog Saw&lt;/em&gt; called "Blowing Up: How Nassim Taleb Turned the Inevitability of Disaster into an Investment Strategy":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/IgonValue.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eigenvalue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really is a very basic concept in linear algebra, and the analysis of the   eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrices is not just some ephemeral bit of esoteric mathematical fluff — among innumerable practical connections, consider this quote from Sergei Brin and Larry Page, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/"&gt;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&lt;/a&gt;", Seventh International World-Wide Web Conference (WWW 1998), April 14-18, 1998, Brisbane, Australia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus this silly mis-hearing tells us (as Pinker notes) that Gladwell's understanding of the ideas he's writing about is limited, here as often, to a sort of metaphorical caricature.  And the resulting conceptual equivocation can be a critical part of the "insights" that he has to offer, which, as Pinker also tells us, often reflect his role as the anti-intellectual's intellectual (or the intellectual's anti-intellectual?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The common thread in Gladwell’s writing is a kind of populism, which seeks to undermine the ideals of talent, intelligence and analytical prowess in favor of luck, opportunity, experience and intuition. For an apolitical writer like Gladwell, this has the advantage of appealing both to the Horatio Alger right and to the egalitarian left. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;common thread&amp;quot; is central to the essay where Igon Value occurs: it constrasts Nassim Taleb, who thinks that investment success is &amp;quot;all pure luck&amp;quot;, who &amp;quot;[doesn&amp;#39;t] believe that things like the stock market behave in the way that physical phenomena like mortality statistics do&amp;quot;, an &amp;quot;empiricist who doesn&amp;#39;t believe in empiricism&amp;quot;, with Victor Niederhoffer, whose &amp;quot;hero is the nineteenth-century scientist Francis Galton … and if he is your hero you believe that by aggregating and analyzing data points, you can learn whatever it is you need to know.&amp;quot; No points for guessing who is the hero of Gladwell&amp;#39;s narrative. And while eigenvalues don&amp;#39;t play any direct role in the argument, things like Gaussian distributions and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002682.html"&gt;fat tails&lt;/a&gt;" do. The "Igon value" flub doesn't increase my confidence that Gladwell has any clue at all what any of this really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to end like this: "What I find most interesting here is that neither the author, nor the stereotypically legendary fact-checkers at the New Yorker (where the pieces in  &lt;em&gt;What the Dog Saw&lt;/em&gt; originally appeared), nor Hachette (&lt;em&gt;What the Dog Saw&lt;/em&gt;'s publisher), took the trouble to hire an out-of-work mathematician to check the text for things of this sort. I presume this means that they assign a very low value to the reputational damage associated with such errors; though of course it might also be hard to find a technically-competent proofreader who would see how to correct the flubs without disturbing the problematic substance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my heavy-handed fundamentalist way, I decided to check the version of the piece in the New Yorker ("&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/04/22/020422fa_fact_gladwell"&gt;Blowing Up&lt;/a&gt;", April 22, 2002). And to my surprise, I found that the New Yorker (at least in its digital archive) spelled the term correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/IgonValue2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm puzzled. Did some copy-editor at Hachette introduce the error? Was the mistake in Gladwell's draft, transferred uncorrected to Hachette despite having been fixed at the New Yorker? Did the New Yorker's editors read Pinker's review and retroactively fix Gladwell's 2002 essay in their archives? Inquiring minds want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In an unironically mock-Gladwellian spirit, I can't resist citing Thomas Pynchon's character Dr. Dudley Eigenvalue, and other aspects of Pynchon's vectorial poetics. See &lt;a href="http://www.thomaspynchon.com/v/extra/eigenvalue.html"&gt;this discussion preserved at pychon.com&lt;/a&gt;, and   Hanjo Berressem's paper  "&lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6750/is_54-55/ai_n31524567/"&gt;A multiplicity of critical eigenvalues&lt;/a&gt;".]&lt;/p&gt;

I've been devoting a bit of time each week to peruse more and more of it, and while there are endless obstacles to a complete understanding of it (including legalese and the annoying tendency of legislation to contain edits to other bills without including the &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt; of the other bills being edited) it is telling that opponents of the bill are having some difficulty coming up with &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; criticisms of it.  For example, the now infamous death panel fiasco was a willful misunderstanding of a completely wholesome concept, the idea that physicians should be compensated for having end-of-life discussions with patients.  It makes sense on multiple levels to reward such discussions.  For one, they are hard conversations to have, and without a motivating factor, they are avoided by many physicians.  The result is a situation in which many patients fail to communicate their desires for the end of their lives, they fall in the default pathway of over-utilization of resources at the end-of-life, with invasive and often pointless interventions that have no benefit and burden and overwhelm the health-care system.  The ideologues who sank that language in the bill should truly rot in hell, because they destroyed a good thing just to create a bogus political argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of the death panel conspiracy theory, has anyone been checking out Arthur Goldwag's coverage of Sarah Palin's conspiratorial beliefs?  How sad is it that we still have candidates for national office that believe things that  fail  the snopes.com test?  Palin gives me the creeps, she represents my worst nightmare, a crank candidate with inroads towards a national campaign.  Goldwag's writing on the &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/11/02/arthur-goldwag-on-th.html"&gt;birther movement is also excellent&lt;/a&gt; and I'm glad to see these crackpots are being &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21808122/Judge-Carter-Ruling-on-MTD"&gt;laughed out of court&lt;/a&gt; for the fools they are.  In particular I liked the text of Judge Carter's decision describing what it's like to deal with cranks in court:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hearings have been interesting to say the least.  Plaintiffs' arguments through Taitz have generally failed to aid the Court.  Instead, Plaintiffs' counsel has favored rhetoric seeking to arouse the emotions and prejudices of her followers rather than the language of a lawyer seeking to present arguments through cogent legal reasoning.  While the Court has no desire to chill Plaintiffs' enthusiastic presentation, Taitz's argument often hampered the efforts of her co-counsel Gary Kreep ("Kreep"), counsel for Plaintiffs Drake and Robinson, to bring serious issues before the Court.  The Court has attempted to give Plaintiffs a voice and a chance to be heard by respecting their choice of counsel and by making every effort to discern the legal arguments of Plaintiffs' counsel amongst the rhetoric. 
   This Court exercised extreme patience when Taitz endangered this case being heard at all by failing to properly file and serve the complaint upon Defendants and held multiple hearings to ensure that the case would not be dismissed on the technicality of failure to effect service.  While the original complaint in this matter was filed on January 20, 2009, Defendants were not properly served until August 25, 2009.  Taitz successfully served Defendants only after the Court intervened on several occasions and requested that defense counsel make significant accommodations for her to effect service.  Taitz also continually refused to comply with court rules and procedure.  Taitz even asked this Court to recuse Magistrate Judge Arthur Nakazato on the basis that he required her to comply with the Local Rules.  See Order Denying Pls.' Mot. For Modification of Mag. J. Nakazato's Aug. 6, 2009, Order; Denying Pls.' Mot. to Recuse Mag. J. Nakazato; and Granting Ex Parte App. for Order Vacating Voluntary Dismissal (Sep. 8, 2009). Taitz also attempted to dismiss two of her clients against their wishes because she did not want to work with their new counsel.  See id. Taitz encouraged her supporters to contact this Court, both via letters and phone calls.  It was improper and unethical for her as an attorney to encourage her supporters to attempt to influence this Court's decision.  Despite these attempts to manipulate this Court, the Court has not considered any outside pleas to influence the Court's decision.
   Additionally, &lt;b&gt;the Court has received several sworn affidavits that Taitz asked potential witnesses that she planned to call before this Court to perjure themselves.  This Court is deeply  concerned that Taitz may have suborned perjury through witnesses she intended to bring before this Court.&lt;/b&gt;   While the Court seeks to ensure that all interested parties have had the opportunity to be heard, the Court cannot condone the conduct of Plaintiffs' counsel in her efforts to influence this Court. 
...
    Plaintiffs have encouraged the Court to ignore these mandates of the Constitution; to 
disregard the limits on its power put in place by the Constitution; and to effectively overthrow a sitting president who was popularly elected by "We the People"-over sixty-nine million of the people.  Plaintiffs have attacked the judiciary, including every prior court that has dismissed their claim, as unpatriotic and even treasonous for refusing to grant their requests and for adhering to the terms of the Constitution which set forth its jurisdiction.  Respecting the constitutional role and jurisdiction of this Court is not unpatriotic.  Quite the contrary, this Courtconsiders commitment to that constitutional role to be the ultimate reflection of patriotism. 
Therefore, for the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can just taste the crankery.  The complete looseness with the truth as long as it conforms to the warped worldview of these crackpots is part and parcel of cranks the world over.  Reading the follow-up of this case from right wing sites like Free Republic, and Storm Front, it's impossible to tell the difference between the conservative ideologues and the unrepentant racists.  All the appeals to patriotism and the constitution are such weak cover for the fact these cranks are angry we have a black president.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to work the long hours of a surgical intern and must say, it's a lot of drudgery.  Internship is much more about paying your dues than about learning a whole lot, although my daily routine is occasionally punctuated by moments of extreme excitement.  For instance, I will not forget the first time I placed a chest tube in a patient in the bedside, the blood that poured out of the guys chest that was keeping him from breathing, or the time I walked into a room to discover a patient in the midst of having a heart attack.  Luckily, the training sets in, and we have a lot of supervision, so even when things get crazy I've always got someone with me who has seen it all before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also am increasingly motivated to write more as I feel less plugged-in than ever to the outside world since writing at least forced me to read tons of diverse information on lots of different topics.  Cranks and crankery are all around us and I'm constantly reminded of the problems they create.  It seems every time I see some topical show, and the commentators pause to reflect for a moment on the problem they're all facing, it seems like they all &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; what the problem is but just don't have a good name for it.  The problem is that lies can be equally effective as the truth, and denialism creates very real problems for us and our democracy every single day. Denialism works, and cranks run amok throughout our country and the world.  We have to keep writing about it until rather being on the tip of everyone's tongue, people are willing to come out and call out denialism for what it is, and shout it down when it rears its ugly head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/11/this_day_in_crankery_november.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/opNybjCx4g4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258381145289"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/marys_monday_metazoan_baby_bea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdd8888d1e9e0b1d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: Baby bear and kitty cat</title><published>2009-11-16T13:28:23Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T13:28:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8oQyNP_1HlE/marys_monday_metazoan_baby_bea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/marys_monday_metazoan_baby_bea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/z4xueqvdb-8%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Like many others, he has found a superficial way in which to interpret quantum mechanics to make is seem as if it is congruent with Eastern metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-illusion-of-past-pres_b_326250.html"&gt;And now he has done it again&lt;/a&gt;, in that anti-science rag the Huffington Post. Chopra goes beyond the typical New Age distortion of QM, which is basically the claim that QM is really weird, therefore magic is real. Chopra assumes some very specific, and common, misinterpretations of QM. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum physics tells us that objects exist in a suspended physical state until observed, when they collapse to just one outcome — we don’t know what happens until we investigate, and our investigation influences that reality. Whether or not certain events may have happened some time ago, may not actually be determined until some time in your future — it may actually be contingent upon actions that have not yet taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra is referring to the wave-particle duality of matter, quantum entanglement, and the uncertainty principle – but he gets them profoundly wrong. First he makes the common mistake of interpreting the collapse of the wave function as being dependent on an observer, which is false. QM states that light, electrons, and all fundamental particles exist not as  discrete point particles, but spread out as a wave. We can only describe the probability that they will be in a specific place at any moment, and that probability is the wave function. Particles, when free from interactions with other matter, actually behave like waves (see the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"&gt;double slit experiments&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But when a particle (whether of photon of light or an electron) interacts with other stuff they are no longer spread out but collapse down to a point particle. This is the wave-particle duality of matter. The collapse to a particle, however, is not dependent on any observer – just interaction with other stuff. No observer is necessary. When a photon from the sun strikes the earth and its energy is absorbed by a leaf on a tree in the middle of the jungle, it collapses to a particle. The same is true when it strikes a dead rocky asteroid out in space. Consciousness, and even life, is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Chopra mangles quantum entanglement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in France shot particles of light “photons” into a measuring apparatus, and showed that what they did — now, in the present — could retroactively change something that had already happened in the past. As the photons passed a fork in the apparatus, they had to decide whether to behave like particles or waves when they hit a beam splitter. Later on — well after the photons passed the fork — the experimenter could randomly switch a second beam splitter on and off electronically. It turns out that what the observer decided at that point, determined what the particle actually did at the fork in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, these experiments are fascinating. But they do not describe the future affecting the past, as Chopra misinterprets. They describe what is known as quantum entanglement. When particles are paired or linked in some way – for example when they are created by the same process – some of their properties are linked, even while still being in a wave of probability. For example, if one particle is spin up, the other will be spin down, even though their spin is not determined until much later, and even if the particles are separated by millions of light years at the time of the collapse of the wave function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicists do not pretend to understand the fundamental nature of quantum entanglement – that is a Nobel prize waiting to be won. But it does not represent the future affecting the past. Nor does it represent faster than light, or instantaneous communication. Experiments have been done showing that it is impossible to transmit information faster than light using quantum entanglement. Information is not going faster than light, or into the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra is using a common trick of the pseudoscientist – exploiting cutting edge science, which the public is not likely to understand, and pretend as if there is proof where there is uncertainty. Take some interesting experiments, then leap way ahead to conclusions that serve their metaphysical purposes, but which are not settled science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short – beware of anyone pretending to understand the ultimate implications of QM and that it supports their far out philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is Chopra’s woo philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only with the advent of quantum physics that scientists began to consider again the old question of the possibility of comprehending the world as a form of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the quantum theory implies that consciousness must exist, and that the content of the mind is the ultimate reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is a mind, and consciousness is the ultimate reality. Not surprisingly, a very Eastern philosophy, packaged nicely  for a Western audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another false underlying assumption of Chopra, which he does not state expressly, is that all of this quantum weirdness (whatever its implications) applies to the macroscopic world. This is true, in a way (depending on how you look at it), but highly misleading. All objects, no matter how large, also are waves and particles. However, the wavelength of matter (the degree to which it is spread out, rather than having a definite position) decreases with mass and velocity. This is defined by the de Broglie equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;λ = h/mv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck’s constant, m is mass, and v is velocity. What this means is that when you start to get larger than a large molecule, the quantum wavelength shrinks to insignificance. When you get to macroscopic objects, the wavelength is orders of magnitude less than the size of elementary particles. So you have a wavelength, but it is so close to zero it can be treated as zero – which is another way of saying you do not behave like a quantum object, but like an object in classical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra, however, thinks that QM applies to everything equally. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we do not look at it, the moon is gone. In this world, only an act of observation can confer shape and form to reality — to a dandelion in a meadow, or a seed pod, or the sun or wind or rain. Anyway, it’s amazing, and even your dog can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is doubly wrong – not only is consciousness (an observer) not the thing that collapses wave functions, but QM effects do not apply to dandelions or moons (try shooting dandelions through a double slit experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason QM effects are not seen in the macroscopic world in which Chopra’s brain exists is decoherence. Remember that weird quantum entanglement I mentioned? Well, this can be observed only is carefully contrived experimental situations. It exists in nature, of course, but tends to be fleeting, because of decoherence. Whenever either paired particle interacts with other stuff in the universe, it becomes less entangled with its original partner, until they are decohered – their properties are no longer linked. It is hard to keep particles from decohering – in fact this is a stumbling block to the development of quantum computers that exploit QM effects. The particles keep decohering and losing their properties which can be used to store information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any macroscopic object, all the particles in that object are interacting with each other and decohering all the time. Again – the weird quantum world collapses to a classical physical world when you scale up to dandelions and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra really needs to have a conversation with a real quantum physicist. You would think that before someone makes a career out of promoting a specific scientific interpretation to the public they would make sure they got the science right. But I suspect Chopra doesn’t care about getting the science right. He seems to be working backwards from his metaphysics, and then happily misinterpreting QM to suit his needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258378193718"><id gr:original-id="784 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71ba617081109248</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="breasts" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/634"/><category term="hoax" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1103"/><category term="intelligence" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/799"/><category term="IQ" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1102"/><category term="journalism" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/695"/><category term="Woo" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/woo"/><category term="Subfeature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/977"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/media"/><title type="html">Media Fall for Big Breasts IQ Hoax</title><published>2009-11-16T09:30:35Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T09:30:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/784" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; On November 12th, the &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/health-fitness/health/Women-with-big-breasts-are-smarter/articleshow/5222300.cms"&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt; became the latest media outlet to publish a report on a study showing a correlation between breast size and IQ. The trouble is, the study doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, in its meagre entirety, goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted in the United States showed that women with big breasts are smarter than those who are less endowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a Singapore newspaper article, Sin Chew Daily revealed that the study was aimed to find out whether the size of a woman’s bust affected her brainpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by a female researcher in Chicago, involved 1,200 women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects were divided into five groups, from extra small to extra big, reports The Star Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study speculated that such women were smarter due to the higher level of female hormones that could result in better development in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating things about the internet is that with a simple search we can track memes over time, and googling some of the details brings up some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this &lt;a href="http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/skraablikk/article159726.ece?execute=viewComments"&gt;Norwegian newspaper story&lt;/a&gt; from November 28th, 2003 - that's six years ago - gives us some more details, including the name of the researcher, sociologist Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, and brilliantly manages to reference &lt;em&gt;'Einsteins relativitetsteori'&lt;/em&gt;, which makes me wish I'd paid attention in Swedish lessons in school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/imagecache/Medium/manboobs.JPG" width="450" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Can Einstein's relativitetsteori explain these?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By January 2004, the story had apparently made its way&lt;a href="http://big-boobs.blogspot.com/"&gt; onto Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;, although the original link appears to be broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...we found that women with big busts average 10 IQ points higher than less well-endowed women," reveals lead researcher Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, herself a meager 32A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is tantalising evidence that the story appeared in Mens' Health magazine by 2006 (&lt;a href="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html" title="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html"&gt;http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html&lt;/a&gt;), although again the link appears to be broken. That same year, one &lt;a href="http://personals.villagevoice.com/blog/1130/post_9474.html?dcb=personals.villagevoice.com"&gt;over-excited poster&lt;/a&gt; on Village Voice even speculates that this phenomenon could explain why America leads the world: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"American women have the largest breasts in the world and our nation's breasts have been increasing in volume with each generation. According to a recent report, the average U.S. cup size has ballooned to an impressive C. That, the sociologists speculate, may explain why the United States leads the world in science and technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the original study is nowhere to be found, which is not surprising because Yvonne Rossdale doesn't appear to exist, which is in itself not surprising because as the Swedish newspaper article reveals, the very first mention of this study anywhere comes from the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TfMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA10&amp;amp;lpg=PA10&amp;amp;dq=%22Dr.+Yvonne+Rossdale%22+iq&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ZouwuZDp2F&amp;amp;sig=nHTWBWlAKNZzfMJb4gMIsv2dRsQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=cxoAS7ScHsT64Abyk5HtCw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Dr.%20Yvonne%20Rossdale%22%20iq&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;November 4th, 2003 edition&lt;/a&gt; of Weekly World News. An edition whose front page carries the EXCLUSIVE story that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein have secretly adopted a shaved monkey baby together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn1.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn2.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right folks, the study &lt;a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001561/2003/11/28.html"&gt;was a spoof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things about this story that are genuinely fascinating, and quite important for science communication. The first is how in the name of God this study ended up in any newspaper in the first place - what kind of mind picks up an edition of Weekly World News, skips past the haunted VCR and the shaved monkey baby, and decides that they've found a real piece of science worth sharing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, equally troubling question is why so many newspapers and magazines around the world are willing to simply regurgitate stories without apparently stopping to do even the most basic fact-checking. When picking up a story reporting research by "Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, a sociologist from the University of Chicago", a journalist should at the very least Google her name, and preferably actually contact her to verify the story. That is, after all, what the job of a journalist is &lt;em&gt;supposed to be&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge can travel the modern world in an instant, but unfortunately, nobody thought to add any checks to ensure that the knowledge was correct. As a result, apparently half of Asia now believe that big-breasted women have higher IQs. That's quite funny, until you realize that by the same process, parents in south Africa now believe the MMR vaccine causes autism, resulting in the recent deaths of four children from an easily preventable childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the information age, ignorance moves at light-speed.&lt;/p&gt;

Group one performed a neuromuscular exercise program consisting of what the authors defined as balance exercises, dynamic joint stability exercises, plyometric exercises, agility drills, and sport specific drills.  The program was previously described in a JOSPT article here.  Group two consisted of a gradual progressive strengthening program for the lower extremity muscles, with specific emphasis on the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus medii, and gastrocnemii.  In general, the results show that:     At 6 months, the neuromuscular group had higher Cincinnati knee scores and global function rating (this was actually previously published in Physical Therapy here).     At 1 year, the neuromuscular group continued to have higher Cincinnati knee scores and global function scores.  The neuromuscular group also had less pain at 1 year out.     At 1 and 2 years, the strengthening group showed significantly stronger hamstrings     This finding was not statistically significant, but thought it was worth mentioning that the neuromuscular group had greater laxity on KT testing at the 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year marks – up to 33% more laxity.  There is some debate that accelerated rehab may lead to graft elongation.       Clinical Implications  There are several implications from this study.  First and foremost, it appears that neuromuscular and strengthen exercise programs following ACL reconstruction are safe and effective in restoring function.  Neuromuscular control exercises appear to lead to better functional outcomes, at least for the first year.  This makes sense, as balance and proprioception will likely have significant carry over into everyday activities.  But one thing keeps coming back to me when I look at these results:     The best rehabilitation program likely combines both strengthening and neuromuscular control exercises   This is how I have always approached ACL patients (and pretty much every injury).  Why choose between optimal function vs. optimal strength when you can have both!?  As an aside, two things I learned about Norway – 1) Insurance routinely covers ACL rehab for 6 months, sweet!  and 2) The mean time from injury to surgery was more than 46 weeks.  So much for universal health care!           Risberg MA, &amp;amp; Holm I (2009).

Like many others, he has found a superficial way in which to interpret quantum mechanics to make is seem as if it is congruent with Eastern metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-illusion-of-past-pres_b_326250.html"&gt;And now he has done it again&lt;/a&gt;, in that anti-science rag the Huffington Post. Chopra goes beyond the typical New Age distortion of QM, which is basically the claim that QM is really weird, therefore magic is real. Chopra assumes some very specific, and common, misinterpretations of QM. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum physics tells us that objects exist in a suspended physical state until observed, when they collapse to just one outcome — we don’t know what happens until we investigate, and our investigation influences that reality. Whether or not certain events may have happened some time ago, may not actually be determined until some time in your future — it may actually be contingent upon actions that have not yet taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra is referring to the wave-particle duality of matter, quantum entanglement, and the uncertainty principle – but he gets them profoundly wrong. First he makes the common mistake of interpreting the collapse of the wave function as being dependent on an observer, which is false. QM states that light, electrons, and all fundamental particles exist not as  discrete point particles, but spread out like a wave. We can only describe the probability that they will be in a specific place at any moment, and that probability is the wave function. Particles, when free from interactions with other matter, actually behave like waves (see the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"&gt;double slit experiments&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a particle (whether of photon of light or an electron) interacts with other stuff it is no longer spread out but collapses down to a point particle. This is the wave-particle duality of matter. The collapse to a particle, however, is not dependent on any observer – just interaction with other stuff. No observer is necessary. When a photon from the sun strikes the earth and its energy is absorbed by a leaf on a tree in the middle of the jungle, it collapses to a particle. The same is true when it strikes a dead rocky asteroid out in space. Consciousness, and even life, is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Chopra mangles quantum entanglement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in France shot particles of light “photons” into a measuring apparatus, and showed that what they did — now, in the present — could retroactively change something that had already happened in the past. As the photons passed a fork in the apparatus, they had to decide whether to behave like particles or waves when they hit a beam splitter. Later on — well after the photons passed the fork — the experimenter could randomly switch a second beam splitter on and off electronically. It turns out that what the observer decided at that point, determined what the particle actually did at the fork in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, these experiments are fascinating. But they do not describe the future affecting the past, as Chopra misinterprets. They describe what is known as quantum entanglement. When particles are paired or linked in some way – for example when they are created by the same process – some of their properties are linked, even while still being in a wave of probability. For example, if one particle is spin up, the other will be spin down, even though their spin is not determined until much later, and even if the particles are separated by millions of light years at the time of the collapse of the wave function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicists do not pretend to understand the fundamental nature of quantum entanglement – that is a Nobel prize waiting to be won. But it does not represent the future affecting the past. Nor does it represent faster than light, or instantaneous communication. Experiments have been done showing that it is impossible to transmit information faster than light using quantum entanglement. Information is not going faster than light, or into the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra is using a common trick of the pseudoscientist – exploit cutting edge science, which the public is not likely to understand, and pretend as if there is proof where there is uncertainty. Take some interesting experiments, then leap way ahead to conclusions that serve their metaphysical purposes, but which are not settled science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short – beware of anyone pretending to understand the ultimate implications of QM and that it supports their far out philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is Chopra’s woo philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only with the advent of quantum physics that scientists began to consider again the old question of the possibility of comprehending the world as a form of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the quantum theory implies that consciousness must exist, and that the content of the mind is the ultimate reality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is a mind, and consciousness is the ultimate reality. Not surprisingly, a very Eastern philosophy, packaged nicely  for a Western audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another false underlying assumption of Chopra, which he does not state expressly, is that all of this quantum weirdness (whatever its implications) applies to the macroscopic world. This is true, in a way (depending on how you look at it), but highly misleading. All objects, no matter how large, also are waves and particles. However, the wavelength of matter (the degree to which it is spread out, rather than having a definite position) decreases with mass and velocity. This is defined by the de Broglie equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;λ = h/mv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck’s constant, m is mass, and v is velocity. What this means is that when you start to get larger than a large molecule, the quantum wavelength shrinks to insignificance. When you get to macroscopic objects, the wavelength is orders of magnitude less than the size of elementary particles. So you have a wavelength, but it is so close to zero it can be treated as zero – which is another way of saying you do not behave like a quantum object, but like an object in classical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra, however, thinks that QM applies to everything equally. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we do not look at it, the moon is gone. In this world, only an act of observation can confer shape and form to reality — to a dandelion in a meadow, or a seed pod, or the sun or wind or rain. Anyway, it’s amazing, and even your dog can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is doubly wrong – not only is consciousness (an observer) not the thing that collapses wave functions, but QM effects do not apply to dandelions or moons (try shooting dandelions through a double slit experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason QM effects are not seen in the macroscopic world in which Chopra’s brain exists is decoherence. Remember that weird quantum entanglement I mentioned? Well, this can be observed only in carefully contrived experimental situations. It exists in nature, of course, but tends to be fleeting, because of decoherence. Whenever either paired particle interacts with other stuff in the universe, it becomes less entangled with its original partner, until they are decohered – their properties are no longer linked. It is hard to keep particles from decohering – in fact this is a stumbling block to the development of quantum computers that exploit QM effects. The particles keep decohering and losing their properties which can be used to store information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any macroscopic object, all the particles in that object are interacting with each other and decohering all the time. Again – the weird quantum world collapses to a classical physical world when you scale up to dandelions and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra really needs to have a conversation with a real quantum physicist. You would think that before someone makes a career out of promoting a specific scientific interpretation to the public they would make sure they got the science right. But I suspect Chopra doesn’t care about getting the science right. He seems to be working backwards from his metaphysics, and then happily misinterpreting QM to suit his needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258374078154"><id gr:original-id="784 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dea4e56af270b0f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="breasts" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/634"/><category term="hoax" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1103"/><category term="intelligence" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/799"/><category term="IQ" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1102"/><category term="journalism" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/695"/><category term="Feature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/976"/><category term="Woo" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/woo"/><category term="Subfeature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/977"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/media"/><title type="html">Media Fall for Big Breasts IQ Hoax</title><published>2009-11-16T09:30:35Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T09:30:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/784" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; On November 12th, the &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/health-fitness/health/Women-with-big-breasts-are-smarter/articleshow/5222300.cms"&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt; became the latest media outlet to publish a report on a study showing a correlation between breast size and IQ. The trouble is, the study doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, in its meagre entirety, goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted in the United States showed that women with big breasts are smarter than those who are less endowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to a Singapore newspaper article, Sin Chew Daily revealed that the study was aimed to find out whether the size of a woman’s bust affected her brainpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by a female researcher in Chicago, involved 1,200 women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects were divided into five groups, from extra small to extra big, reports The Star Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study speculated that such women were smarter due to the higher level of female hormones that could result in better development in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating things about the internet is that with a simple search we can track memes over time, and googling some of the details brings up some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this &lt;a href="http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/skraablikk/article159726.ece?execute=viewComments"&gt;Norwegian newspaper story&lt;/a&gt; from November 28th, 2003 - that's six years ago - gives us some more details, including the name of the researcher, sociologist Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, and brilliantly manages to reference &lt;em&gt;'Einsteins relativitetsteori'&lt;/em&gt;, which makes me wish I'd paid attention in Swedish lessons in school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/imagecache/Medium/manboobs.JPG" width="450" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Can Einstein's relativitetsteori explain these?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By January 2004, the story had apparently made its way&lt;a href="http://big-boobs.blogspot.com/"&gt; onto Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;, although the original link appears to be broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...we found that women with big busts average 10 IQ points higher than less well-endowed women," reveals lead researcher Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, herself a meager 32A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is tantalising evidence that the story appeared in Mens' Health magazine by 2006 (&lt;a href="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html" title="http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html"&gt;http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-55339.html&lt;/a&gt;), although again the link appears to be broken. That same year, one &lt;a href="http://personals.villagevoice.com/blog/1130/post_9474.html?dcb=personals.villagevoice.com"&gt;over-excited poster&lt;/a&gt; on Village Voice even speculates that this phenomenon could explain why America leads the world: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"American women have the largest breasts in the world and our nation's breasts have been increasing in volume with each generation. According to a recent report, the average U.S. cup size has ballooned to an impressive C. That, the sociologists speculate, may explain why the United States leads the world in science and technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the original study is nowhere to be found, which is not surprising because Yvonne Rossdale doesn't appear to exist, which is in itself not surprising because as the Swedish newspaper article reveals, the very first mention of this study anywhere comes from the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TfMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA10&amp;amp;lpg=PA10&amp;amp;dq=%22Dr.+Yvonne+Rossdale%22+iq&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ZouwuZDp2F&amp;amp;sig=nHTWBWlAKNZzfMJb4gMIsv2dRsQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=cxoAS7ScHsT64Abyk5HtCw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Dr.%20Yvonne%20Rossdale%22%20iq&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;November 4th, 2003 edition&lt;/a&gt; of Weekly World News. An edition whose front page carries the EXCLUSIVE story that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein have secretly adopted a shaved monkey baby together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn1.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/wwn2.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right folks, the study &lt;a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001561/2003/11/28.html"&gt;was a spoof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things about this story that are genuinely fascinating, and quite important for science communication. The first is how in the name of God this study ended up in any newspaper in the first place - what kind of mind picks up an edition of Weekly World News, skips past the haunted VCR and the shaved monkey baby, and decides that they've found a real piece of science worth sharing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, equally troubling question is why so many newspapers and magazines around the world are willing to simply regurgitate stories without apparently stopping to do even the most basic fact-checking. When picking up a story reporting research by "Dr. Yvonne Rossdale, a sociologist from the University of Chicago", a journalist should at the very least Google her name, and preferably actually contact her to verify the story. That is, after all, what the job of a journalist is &lt;em&gt;supposed to be&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge can travel the modern world in an instant, but unfortunately, nobody thought to add any checks to ensure that the knowledge was correct. As a result, apparently half of Asia now believe that big-breasted women have higher IQs. That's quite funny, until you realize that by the same process, parents in south Africa now believe the MMR vaccine causes autism, resulting in the recent deaths of four children from an easily preventable childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the information age, ignorance moves at light-speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve blurred out the school’s identifying information in the pic below, but you can see that several of the high school students staged a counter protest, which I think is just great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/high-schoolers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/high-schoolers.jpg" alt="Counterprotest" title="Counterprotest" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see, but a few students are holding up a poster which says “Come Hug Me.”  The full message contains a $5 offer to any of Phelps’ people who will come get a hug from a gay student.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one took them up on the offer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That picture comes courtesy of a reader named &lt;strong&gt;Sarah&lt;/strong&gt;, who attended that high school years ago and stopped by when she heard Phelps’ people were coming for a visit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She came in proper attire, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows Sarah (right) and her friend &lt;strong&gt;Kat&lt;/strong&gt; (left) wearing well-stated “I’m Not with Stupid” shirts as they stand near a member of the Phelps Clan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/15831_737590894848_7702158_42480229_1888783_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/15831_737590894848_7702158_42480229_1888783_n.jpg" alt="notwithstupid" title="notwithstupid" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting ignorance with humor — I like it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why that guy is wearing a rainbow-y thing, but Sarah suggests it may just indicate a connection between the signs and homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it give you a warm, fuzzy feeling to know that so many young people realize how crazy Phelps and his clan’s beliefs are?  The Westboro group’s views regarding homosexuality are only slightly more extreme than those of the Christian Right in general.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, they can find it stressful and uncomfortable when denied the status that they crave. Similarly, people low in testosterone find it uncomfortable to be placed in positions of authority. An intriguing new study has built on these earlier findings, showing a mismatch between testosterone-level and status can have an effect on group functioning. Groups made up of people whose status in the group doesn&amp;#39;t match their testosterone level tend to have less collective confidence (or &amp;quot;collective efficacy&amp;quot; in the psychological jargon). This could be important given that prior investigations have shown that groups with higher collective efficacy perform better.Michael Zyphur and colleagues assigned 92 groups of between 4 and 7 undergrads to an on-going task that involved meeting twice a week for 12 weeks, and included creating a professional management-training video. Six weeks into the project the researches measured the participants&amp;#39; testosterone levels via saliva samples. They also asked all members in each group to vote on each others&amp;#39; status. Then six weeks after that, at the end of the project, the researchers measured each group&amp;#39;s collective efficacy by summing members&amp;#39; confidence in their group&amp;#39;s ability to succeed.The key finding was that groups made up of members whose status was out of synch with their testosterone level tended to have the lowest collective efficacy. The researchers think that testosterone-status mismatch within a group probably has a detrimental effect on that group&amp;#39;s collective confidence. However, another possibility, which they acknowledge, is that a lack of group confidence leads to a mismatch between testosterone levels and status among group members. Co-author Jayanth Narayanan told the Digest that his team need to replicate their finding in a work setting. &amp;quot;Perhaps workplace settings might enhance these effects. Perhaps some types of work environments might attenuate these effects. These are open questions at this stage,&amp;quot; he said. _________________________________Zyphur, M., Narayanan, J., Koh, G., &amp;amp; Koh, D. (2009).

You'll have to go below the fold to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/MAHEOO-REIKI-COURSE-NATIVE-AMERICAN-GREAT-SPIRIT_W0QQitemZ330347019962QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item4cea377eba"&gt;Item number 330347019962: MA'HEO'O REIKI COURSE (NATIVE AMERICAN - GREAT SPIRIT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our old white woman is named Rosemary, and--well, I'll just let the seller tell you.&lt;br&gt;Rosemary is a holistic healer, a Reiki Grand Master, and Certified Master Teacher of a multitude of Reiki forms specializing in Usui and Kundalini Reiki.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So she's into Asian bullshit. Why the Native American spin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's worth noting that she apparently does other things: "Crystals, grid work, shamanic, chakras, lucid dreaming, Modality Tapping," and the list goes on. She practices from "Magickal Myrtle Beach," presumably from the inside of a sacred configuration of miniature golf courses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I always knew something was sinister about that place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ma'heo'O Reiki&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ma'heo'o translated means Great Spirit, Great One or God. The word Ma'heo'o is Cheyenne, Native American language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The word "Reiki" is American, woo-peddler language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This system of energy works will combine the elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire with the Great Spirit to effectively promote and activate healing in the human condition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Little known True Fact: Native American cosmology was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Classical Greece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ma'heo'o Reiki was created by Rev. Sheryl Carter&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm sure her nickname is "Trailing Coyote" or somesuch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;and employs symbols derived from the Native American Peoples and Mother Earth so as to work in accordance with Native American Tradition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, because all Native American Peoples had the same symbols and traditions. They were all in the same place. No pesky heterogeneity to worry about, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It contains a variety of new techniques based on Native American Spirituality which offer the ability to bring you into alignment with the frequencies of the elements, center and calm the 5 elements within our bodies, bring about recognition of our sacred name and totem animals, teachings of connecting the sacred circuit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apart from the fact that that isn't a sentence, I feel the need to remind the reader that our kind seller previously only named &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; elements. I guess now we can form Captain Planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ma'heo'o Reiki course will guide you through the various frequencies of the energy symbols and techniques that you can use to improve and enrich your life. Native American Tradition is covered and incorporated into the treatments and the completing of the Sacred Circuit techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Handbook of North American Indians&lt;/i&gt; is a fifteen-volume encyclopedia (with plans to top out at twenty) that attempts to collect and organize all of the information we have about the various tribes, nations, and organizations of Indians. It's been a work in progress since 1978. Somehow I doubt a little pamphlet can, in any capacity, cover and incorporate "Native American Tradition."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess our seller is just a flaming racist!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-4400733357303230643?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258361364828"><id gr:original-id="http://www.shockmd.com/2009/11/16/the-neuroscience-of-music-enjoyment-and-depression/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d4125f1de884611</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Neuroscience of Music Enjoyment and Depression</title><published>2009-11-16T02:35:44Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T02:35:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/b4B4kJCgHBY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.shockmd.com/2009/11/16/the-neuroscience-of-music-enjoyment-and-depression/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">When feeling down good music can cheer you up.

The work had been presented at least in part at recent meetings, but now all of us can digest it in entirety.The impressive economy of this paper is that they targeted (using Agilent chips) less than 30Mb of the human genome, which is less than 1%.  They also worked with very few samples; only about 30 cases of Miller Syndrome have been reported in the literature.  While I&amp;#39;ve expressed some reservations about &amp;quot;exome sequencing&amp;quot;, this paper does illustrate why it can be very cost effective and my objections (perhaps not made clear enough before) is more a worry about being too restricted to &amp;quot;exomes&amp;quot; and less about targeting.  Only four affected individuals (two siblings and two individuals unrelated to anyone else in the study) were sequenced, each at around 40X coverage of the targeted regions.  Since Miller is so vanishingly rare, the causative mutations should be absent from samples of human diversity such as dbSNP or the HapMap, so these was used as a filter.  Non-synonymous (protein-altering), splice site mutations &amp;amp; coding indels were considered as candidates.  Both dominant models and recessive models were considered.  Combining the data from both siblings, 228 candidate dominant genes and 9 recessive ones fell out.  Looking then to the unrelated individuals zeroed in on a single gene, DHODH, under the recessive model (but 8 in the dominant model).  Using a conservative statistical model, the odds of finding this by chance were estimated at 1.5x10e-05.An interesting curve was thrown by nature.  If predictions were made as to whether mutations would be damaging, then DHODH was excluded as a candidate gene under a recessive model.  Both siblings carried one allele (G605A) predicted to be neutral but another allele predicted to be damaging.Another interesting curve is a second gene, DNAH5, which was a candidate considering only the siblings&amp;#39; data but ruled out by the other two individuals&amp;#39; data.  However, this gene is already known to be linked to a Mendelian disorder.  The two siblings had a number of symptoms which do not fit with any other Miller case -- and well fit the symptoms of DNAH5 mutation.  So these two individuals have two rare genetic diseases!Getting back to DHODH, is it the culprit in Miller?  Sequencing three further unrelated patients found them all to be compound heterzygotes for mutations predicted to be damaging.  So it becomes reasonable to infer that a false prediction of non-damaging was made for G605A.  Sequencing of DHODH in parents of the affected individuals confirmed that each was a carrier, ruling out DHODH as a causative gene under a dominant model.  DHODH is known to encode dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes a biochemical step in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines.  This is a pathway targeted in some cancer chemotherapies, with the unfortunate result that some individuals are exposed to these drugs in utero -- and these persons manifest symptoms similar to Miller syndrome.  Furthermore, another genetic disease (Nagler) has great overlap in symptoms with Miller -- but sequencing of DHODH in 12 unrelated patients failed to find any coding mutations in DHODH.   The authors point to the possible impact of this approach. They note that there are 7,000 diseases which affect fewer than 200K patients in the U.S. (a widely used definition of rare disease), but in aggregate this is more than 25M persons.  Identifying the underlying mutations for a large fraction of these diseases would advance our understanding of human biology greatly, and with a bit of luck some of these mutations will suggest practical therapeutic or dietary approaches which can ameliorate the disease.  Despite the success here, they also underline opportunities for improvement.  First, in some cases variant calling was difficult due to poor coverage in repeated regions.  Conversely, some copy number variation manifested itself in false positive calls of variation.  Second, the SNP databases for filtering will be most useful if they are derived from similar populations; if studying patients with a background poorly represented in dbSNP or HapMap then those databases won&amp;#39;t do.  How economical a strategy would this be?  Whole exome sequencing on this scale can be purchased for a bit under $20K/individual; to try to do this by Sanger would probably be at least 25X that.  So whole exome sequencing of the 4 original individuals would be less than $100K for sequencing (but clearly a bunch more for interpretation, sample collection, etc).  The follow-up sequencing would a add a bit, but probably less than one exome&amp;#39;s worth of sequencing.  Even if a study turned up a lot of candidate variants, smaller scale targeted sequencing can be had for $5K or less per sample.  Digging into the methods, the study actually used two passes of array capture -- the second to clean up what wasn&amp;#39;t captured well by the first array design &amp;amp; to add newer gene predictions.  This is a great opportunity to learn from these projects -- the array designs can keep being refined to provide even coverage across the targeted genes.  And, of course, as the cost per base of the sequencing portion continues its downwards slide this will get even more attractive -- or possibly simply be displaced by really cheap whole genome sequencing.  If the cost of the exome sequencing can be approximately halved, then perhaps a project similar to this could be run for around $100K.So, if 700 diseases could each be examined at 100K/disease, that would come out to $70M -- hardly chump change.  This underlines the huge utility of getting sequencing costs down another order of magnitude.  At $1000/genome, the sequencing costs of the project would stop grossly overshadowing the other key areas - sample collection &amp;amp; data interpretation.  If the total cost of such a project could be brought down closer to $20K, then now we&amp;#39;re looking at $14M to investigate all described rare genetic disorders.  That&amp;#39;s not to say it shouldn&amp;#39;t be done at $70M or even several times that, but ideally some of the money saved by cheaper sequencing could go to elucidating the biology of the causative alleles such a campaign would unearth, because certainly many of them will be much more enigmatic than DHODH.Sarah B.

The entire eclipse lasts closer to two &lt;i&gt;hours&lt;/i&gt;. What I wanted to know is just how much we'd have to change physical parameters to make the eclipse happen as it does in TV world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won't give away the answer, but &lt;i&gt;wow&lt;/i&gt; is it a pain to figure out! The reason is there's a &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; of different variables that go into it. First off, consider the shadow of the moon holding still as it would appear to in &lt;a href="http://www.salagram.net/solar-eclipse.gif"&gt;this static picture&lt;/a&gt;. In that, the earth would turn through the shadow, making the eclipse occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in reality, the moon is moving too. So you have to add that motion in. Que moving coordinate frames with spherical trig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to quantify all this has not been particularly easy. When I first thought this question up, I figured it would take 15 minutes of derivation. I've been tinkering with it for 3 months here and there, and still haven't solved the full system, although I think I've accounted for all the variables to an order of magnitude approximation which is all I really needed in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was hoping to find a nice little equation (and by little, I don't literally mean little) that was behind one of these &lt;a href="http://www.chris.obyrne.com/Eclipses/calculator.html"&gt;eclipse calculators&lt;/a&gt;, but surprisingly, I haven't been able to find it with all the powers of the internet behind me! I've been using Google books, and going through quite a few texts available and still haven't found the full equation (only approximations).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the more recent ones (starting around 1970) all have their solutions written as computer languages (and I don't care enough to sit there and reverse engineer their Fortran or C++). So interestingly, the most useful books are ones that date back to the turn of last century!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've always thought of astronomical history as very interesting so I find myself reading more than strictly necessary. One of the most interesting things I've come across in this venture was a note on "Flame-like proturberances" during solar eclipses:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img height="80%" width="80%" src="http://s94958815.onlinehome.us/angryastronomer/oldeclipse.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immediately after the commencement of the total obscuration, red protuberances, resembling flames, appear to issue from the edge of the moon's disk. These appearances, which were first noticed by Vassenius, on the occasion of the total solar eclipse which was visible at Gottenberg on the 3rd of May, 1733, have been re-observed on the occurrence of every total solar eclipse which has taken place since that time, and constitute one of the most curious and interseting effects attending this class of phenomena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- From &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pIU-AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Handbook of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, 1875.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Obviously today we call them solar prominences and know they're a result of matter captured by the Sun's magnetic fields or blown out through other stellar activity. But it's interesting seeing just how far Astronomy has come in the last 134 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those that are curious, there's a &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1998ASPC..150...11T&amp;amp;link_type=GIF"&gt;review article&lt;/a&gt; on the history of solar prominences that's quite interesting as well. In the 1840's some thought these prominences were "mountains on the sun". It wasn't until the 1850's that it was realized these were more likely clouds of some sort, and it wasn't the 1900's that a full interpretation was realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think of what we'll learn in the next 100 years....&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5751883206630749257?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258351061505"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/schadenfreude_again_over_david_irving.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8129d7ba2b65d249</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History"/><title type="html">Schadenfreude again over David Irving</title><published>2009-11-16T05:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-11-16T05:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/jcEyPjrSpsc/schadenfreude_again_over_david_irving.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/schadenfreude_again_over_david_irving.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I seem to have attracted several truly idiotic Holocaust deniers in the comments after this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/combatting_holocaust_denial_ur_doing_it.php"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, including, believe it or not, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/combatting_holocaust_denial_ur_doing_it.php#comment-2073239"&gt;Eric Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the anti-Semite who&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070227222832/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/17/wiesel.arrest.ap/index.html"&gt; attacked Elie Wiesel at a San Francisco hotel in 2007&lt;/a&gt; and who now runs a blog full of Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism where he recently &lt;a href="http://erichunt.net/david-irving-speech-attacked-violent-jewish-hate-criminals/" rel="nofollow"&gt;bragged&lt;/a&gt; about attending an appearance by arch-Holocaust denier David Irving and &lt;a href="http://erichunt.net/spielberg-zisblatt-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow"&gt;bleating&lt;/a&gt; about a vacuous legal suit he's bringing against Steven Spielberg and Irene Weisberg Zisblatt over what he considers to be a "defamatory" documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

The catalyst for this most recent round of criticism by the press and navel-gazing by researchers is the investigation of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) of nine psychiatric researchers, one of which held $6 million in stock in a company formed to bring a drug for depression to market, but had allegedly concealed this, even though he was an investigator on an NIH grant to study the drug he was developing. From my perspective, there is more than a little politics going on in this story, given that for the last decade federal law, specifically the Bayh-Dole Act, and policy have actually encouraged investigators and universities to co-develop drugs and treatments with industry, but it does bring into focus the issue of conflicts of interest, in particular undisclosed conflicts of interest. There are two articles of note that recently appeared in the scientific literature discussing this issue, one in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5936/28"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; in July (about the Grassley investigation) and an editorial in the &lt;a href="http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-34/issue-6/pdf/pg412.pdf"&gt;Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; by Simon N. Young, PhD, the Co-Editor-in-Chief of the journal and faculty at McGill University. I was more interested in the latter article because it takes a much braoder view of the issue. Science-based medicine (SBM) depends upon the integrity of the science being done to justify treatments; so it’s useful to discuss how conflicts of interest intersect medical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most public discussions of conflicts of interest (COIs), Young notes, the primary focus is on payments by pharmaceutical companies to investigators. Make no mistake, this is a big issue, but COIs are not just payments from drug companies. Indeed, I’ve written about just such COIs that have arguably impacted patient care negatively right her on this very blog, for example &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=192"&gt;seeding trials&lt;/a&gt; (in which clinical trials are designed by the marketing division of pharmaceutical companies), a case of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=408"&gt;fraud that appeared to have been motivated by COIs&lt;/a&gt;. What needs to be understood is that every single scientific and medical investigators have COIs of one sort or another, and many are not financial. That’s why I like Young’s introduction to what COIs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A COI occurs when individuals’ personal interests are in conflict with their professional obligations. Often this means that someone will profit personally from decisions made in his or her professional role. The personal profit is not necessarily monetary; it could be progress toward the personal goals of the individual or organization, for example the success of a journal for a publisher or editor or the acceptance of ideas for a researcher. The concern is that a COI may bias behaviour, and it is the potential for bias that makes COIs so important. Before getting into the specifics of COIs, I will describe some of the research on the biases we all have, the evidence that we are not always aware of our own biases, how biases can be created by vested interests and how people behave in response to revela- tions of COIs. The idea that scientists are objective seekers of truth is a pleasing fiction, but counterproductive in so far as it can lessen vigilance against bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, financial COIs are probably the easiest to deal with as far as a practical matter. Here, transparency is key, because it’s not necessarily COIs per se that can destroy the credibility of a study. Rather it’s the COIs that are not disclosed (henceforth referred to as undisclosed COIs, or UCOIs) that cause the most problems. If I read a paper and in the paper it is disclosed that the first author received funding from the pharmaceutical company that makes the drug being studied, that in and of itself does not invalidate the study, the simplistically nonsensical arguments of, for example, Dr. Jay Gordon notwithstanding, who of late has been claiming that the promotion of H1N1 flu vaccination is far more due to pharmaceutical companies’ drive for profits than it is based on scientific and public health considerations and who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php"&gt;likens vaccine manufacturers to tobacco manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; promoting junk science. Good science trumps COIs, and, in spite of how badly they are often castigated and some of their misdeeds in the past, pharmaceutical companies do fund a lot of good science. That being said, pharma funding of a study does make me look at it more skeptically than I would if it were funded by another source, mainly because there is a direct financial incentive, often with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the development of a drug on the line, to have a good result. For these COIs, daylight is the best remedy. If readers don’t know about a financial COI, they can’t judge how important that COI is or is not or how it might impact a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Young points out that, while disclosure is the primary means by which scientific organizations and journals deal with COIs, this is not a bullet-proof solution. True, there is evidence that disclosure does work to have the intended effect, and Young cites a study in which two manuscripts were given to two groups of reviewers to read, one to each group. The manuscripts’ content was identical, but one listed COIs and the other did not. The results showed that those reading the manuscripts with the disclosed COIs found the study reported in the manuscript to be “less interesting and less important.” However, it turns out that disclosure may not always be effective due to paradoxical effects. First, authors who declare a COI may feel that their declaration “frees” them to be less objective and argue their point more strongly. Also, authors may feel that the weight of the declared COI makes it necessary for them to exaggerate the significance of their results in order to overcome any additional skepticism in the reader provoked by the COI. Finally, readers may actually be influenced by statements and information they know they should ignore, the COI disclosure notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more difficult to quantify are non-financial COIs. Let’s start with one COI that each and every researcher can be reasonably assumed to have, and that’s a strong desire to have one’s ideas and hypotheses validated by science and accepted by the scientific community. I originally became a scientist, as well as a physician, in order to study cancer and to develop more effective therapies for cancer than what we currently have. To achieve that goal, I have to develop hypotheses that accurately describe a phenomenon and make useful predictions. I can see how easy it is to become emotionally attached to my preferred hypothesis, especially since I can see that if I’m right I will have a rare chance to improve significantly the care of breast cancer patients. If my hypothesis is wrong it could well be back to the drawing board for one of the two projects that my lab works on, my career half over and not a lot of time to make a mark. (Bringing an idea to fruition in terms of treatment can easily take 10 or 20 years, and I probably have about 20 years left in my career if I stay healthy and productive.) Add to that my desire to be perceived as a good researcher and for my strategy for treating breast cancer that I’m working on (but have not yet published on) to take hold, and it’s easy to see that I have to be very, very careful not to let such considerations sway me. For a scientist, few things are more painful than to see a cherished hypothesis fall under the weight of opposing evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about how a very common procedure for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, vertebroplasty, had recently been subjected to two significant clinical trials, one from the U.S. and one from Australia, both of which found vertebroplasty to be &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=665"&gt;no more efficacious at relieving pain than placebo&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, I even likened it to acupuncture and briefly recapped its history, in which small, lower quality studies (unblinded, no controls, or other methodological shortcomings), along with physicians’ anecdotal experience, led to the perception that vertebroplasty is efficacious. Consider this quote I included in my post from one of the early boosters of vertebroplasty, Dr. Joshua A. Hirsch, director of interventional neuroradiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I adore my patients,” Dr. Hirsch added, “and it hurts me that they suffer, to the point that I come in on my days off to do these procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the desire of physician-scientists and physician-investigators to help their patients. Trust me, we get a rush when we can dramatically help a patient. Scientists get the same rush when their hypotheses are confirmed. It’s one of the rewards that motivate us. In Dr. Hirsch’s case, he even declared that he “believed in clinical trials” but that he really believed that vertebroplasty worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where basic human psychological considerations then start to mix with more tangible COIs. Let me use myself as an example If my hypothesis is not falsified, then there’s the potential for more publications, more grants, and much more prominence in the breast cancer research community than I currently have, which, admittedly, is relatively modest. More importantly, if my hypothesis is correct, the results of my research might improve the survival and ease the suffering of millions of women with breast cancer. Here, emotional attachment to a hypothesis can merge with other intangible COIs (fame, prominence, the respect of one’s peers) and tangible COIs (more grants, more publications, promotions, and awards). Any researcher who claims that these things don’t sway their decisions and thinking or don’t contribute to bias is either self-deluded or lying. Indeed, this pride of ownership of their own research can lead to overselling it or to downplaying its shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This presumably is responsible for the fact that when authors were interviewed about their published papers “important weaknesses were often admitted on direct questioning but were not included in the published article.”&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; Certainly editors are used to ask- ing authors to mention the limitations of their studies and to be more cautious about the implications of the research. Another related factor is the desire for researchers to advance their careers and get recognition from their peers. Research suggests that social and monetary reward may work through both psychological&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; and neuroanatomical processes&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; that overlap to some extent. The big difference in relation to COIs is that social rewards, unlike monetary rewards, cannot be disclosed in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed they can’t, even though scientists are human after all, and therefore subject to the same human needs as any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point that comes up in behavioral research about COIs is that human beings do not know their own minds very well. They think they do, but they really do not, which may account for just how vehemently so many researchers deny that financial support from drug companies or elsewhere affects their decisions. Ask yourself how many times you’ve heard a researcher claim that, yes, he has a COI but he would never, ever be influenced by that. He can remain objective in spite fo that. As Young summarizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent short review in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; asks how well people know their own minds and concludes the answer is not very well.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This is because “In real life, people do not realize that their self-knowledge is a construction, and fail to recognize that they possess a vast adaptive unconscious that operates out of their conscious awareness.” Wilson and Brekke&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; reviewed some of the unwanted influences on judgments and evaluations. They concluded that people find it difficult to avoid unwanted responses because of mental processing that is unconscious or uncontrollable. Moore and Loewenstein&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; argue that “the automatic nature of self-interest gives it a primal power to influence judgment and makes it difficult for people to understand its influence on their judgment, let alone eradicate its influence.” They also point out that in contrast to self-interest, understanding one’s ethical and professional obligations involves a more thoughtful process. The in- volvement of different cognitive processes may make it difficult to reconcile self-interest and obligations. MacCoun,&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; in an extensive review, examined the experimental evidence about bias in the interpretation and use of research results. He also discussed the evidence and theories concerning the cognitive and motivational mechanisms that produce bias. He concluded that people assume that their own views are objective and “that subjectivity (e.g., due to personal ideology) is the most likely explanation for their opponents’ conflicting perceptions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when it comes to COIs, we as human beings are in general very, very poor at judging how much we are being influenced by such considerations, because self-interest is primal and functions at very basic and largely unconcious areas of our minds. Again, this is why so many scientists will deny that they are being influenced pharma funding and why physicians will vehemently deny that their prescribing choices are influenced by gifts received from drug companies. They really, really believe it, too. They’re not lying. They’re self-image is that they are rational and that they can separate these COIs from their scientific and medical decision-making process, but behavioral research would argue otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does all of this mean that the “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) crowd or the quacks of the world are right? Is science-based medicine so hopelessly compromised by COIs and bias that it can be discounted in favor of fairy dust like homeopathy, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and other magic? Of course not. Reality is reality, science is science, and evidence trumps all, even COIs. Here, I think it’s instructive to contrast how science-based medicine is dealing with COIs now with how CAM advocates deal with them. However halting, messy, and at times inadequate science-based medicine deals with COIs, it is as nothing compared to how poorly CAM advocates deal with them. Let’s contrast how CAM advocates and pseudoscientists deal with COIs. Basically, they don’t. To them, COIs only matter if the person with the COI is someone they don’t like. The aforementioned &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Dr. Gordon likes to state&lt;/a&gt; over and over again that if a study is funded by a drug company he doesn’t believe it. I’ve tried over five years to convince him that this is poppycock. Yet, when it comes to COIs, few can match CAM researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as long as the investigator or physician with a COI is on the “right” side, COIs can be completely overlooked. For example, the patron saint of the anti-vaccine and autism quackery movement, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, not only received large amounts of money from trial lawyers before doing his “research” in 1998 that sparked the MMR scare but he had filed for a patent on a vaccine to compete with the existing MMR, as investigative journalist Brian Deer &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm"&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt;. The result was incompetent and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;possibly even fraudulent research&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=andrew+wakefield&amp;amp;domains=ageofautism.com&amp;amp;sitesearch=ageofautism.com&amp;amp;btnG=+Google+Search+"&gt;circles the wagons around Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; whenever he is criticized and even awarded him &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/08/age-of-autism-awards-2008-galileo-award-dr-andrew-wakefield.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;its “Galileo Award” for 2008&lt;/a&gt;, where Mark Blaxill likened the “inquisition” against him for his COIs and incompetent research to the Inquisition that ultimately forced Galileo to recant, likening the scientific complaints against Wakefield for his gross incompetence and undisclosed COIs to a “religious war,” writing this gag-inducing bit of desecration of Galileo’s memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t in any way diminish the importance of Galileo, but in an interesting way, Wakefield’s steadfastness in the face of adversity outshines the man in whose name we honor him. For, although Galileo finally agreed to recant his support for heliocentrism, Wakefield has never buckled under the pressure. Instead he has stuck to his guns and continued to fight for families with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for that one and ask for your forgiveness if you now find yourself praying to the porcelain god, disgorging the contents of your upper GI tract as an offering. Meanwhile, at the risk of causing a repeat trip to worship, I will point out that just last month the granddaddy of all anti-vaccine groups, with the wonderfully Orwellian name &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org/Events/schedule.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;gave Wakefield its Humanitarian Award&lt;/a&gt;. What can we conclude from this? Basically, in SBM UCOIs, once discovered, usually get you castigated, particularly if there is even a whiff of fraud. In quackery land, they get you awards, regardless of whether there is fraud. There are numerous other examples of “alternative medicine” practitioners with nearly as massive COIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there are at least two huge differences between pseudoscience and quackery versus SBM. In SBM, scientists try very hard to falsify their hypotheses in order to test their validity; in contrast, among pseudoscientists and quacks, rarely do “investigators” actually “test” anything. Rather they look for confirmatory evidence to support their beliefs and view themselves as virtuous underdogs fighting for their patients for having done so, even as they subject them to useless or even harmful quackery. More telling is the reaction to COIs. This is where the hypocrisy of CAM supporters comes into full relief. AoA bloggers will blast, for instance, Paul Offit as &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html"&gt;Dr. PrOffit&lt;/a&gt;, and cranks like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. will call him a “&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/"&gt;biostitute&lt;/a&gt;” for having received royalties from a drug company for the vaccine his lab invented. They’ll blast scientific journals for accepting too much advertising from drug companies. Yet, on AoA itself are numerous ads for compounding pharmacies, supplement sellers, gluten-free diets, and all manner of other unproven “treatments” for autism. Another example, Dr. Joseph Mercola, routinely castigates SBM for COIs while at the same time &lt;a href="http://products.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;selling&lt;/a&gt; all manner of supplements and woo on his website. To such as J.B. Handley and his merry band of anti-vaccine cranks at &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; and AoA or Dr. Mercola, it’s only a COI if they say it is. Indeed, the right kind of COI can even make you a hero in their eyes, and that’s not even counting the positive reinforcement given someone like Wakefield by legions of adoring anti-vaccinationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that COIs do matter. Because science is a human endeavor, it will never be perfectly pristine, because nothing humans do is perfectly pristine. Moreover, SBM hasn’t always understood or handled COIs, both disclosed and undisclosed, real or perceived, very well, to the point where new regulations by the government may well be necessary. Moreover, there are always more intangible COIs, such as pride of ownership of research, the desire to be proven right, and the respect of one’s peers that, unlike financial COIs, can’t be quantified. As Young says in his article, the “objective of a literature relatively free of bias remains a pious but distant hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, I’ll paraphrase Winston Churchill’s (in)famous comment about democracy in describing SBM by saying that science-based medicine is the worst form of medicine, except for all those others that have been tried. In particular, that includes dogma-based medicine or anecdote-based medicine, two dominant forms of medicine that have been practiced since the days of ancient Egyptian physician-priests to ancient shaman medicine men through the days of barber-surgeons using bleeding as a treatment for almost everything to the physician of 200 years ago advocating purging and treatments with toxic metals like cadmium and antimony. Progress in medicine was glacial, with few advances over decades or even centuries, until science was seriously applied to medical investigation in a serious and systematic way beginning in the 19th century and exploding in the 20th. The last 50 years have seen incredible advances in medical care, thanks to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, SBM is not perfect. Financial interests, COIs, and the pride of individual practitioners undermine it, and there are a depressing number of ills that it offers too little for. But it’s so much better than any alternative we have tried before. It works, and, although it does so in fits and starts, sometimes all too slowly, it’s getting better all the time. Dealing more effectively with COIs will only help it to continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here you go, an image of the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc_200911109_apollo11.html"&gt;Apollo 11 landing site&lt;/a&gt; as seen by the &lt;a href="http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="onegiantleap" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/onegiantleap.jpg?w=540&amp;amp;h=309" alt="onegiantleap" width="540" height="309"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A detailed description of this photo is given over at the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/09/one-giant-leap/"&gt;Bad Astronomy blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it before, but this time LRO is in its 50 km mapping orbit, so the resolution on this image is far higher — about 50 or so centimeters (20 inches). In this image, &lt;a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/FIGURES/traverses/as11traverse.jpg"&gt;the tracks&lt;/a&gt; made by Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they scampered on the Moon for 2 hours and 31 minutes are obvious. You can even see the lander footpads, each just less than a meter (a bit over a yard) across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright spots south of (below) the lander are various scientific packages they installed, including the Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector and the Passive Seismic Experiment. If I’ve got the scale right, &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Apollo_11_photo_map.gif"&gt;the faint dark trail going to the upper left&lt;/a&gt; is where they put the TV camera. Somewhere between that and the lander is the flag. The Sun was shining straight down in this image, so the flag isn’t visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The image above is a piece of a much larger photo taken by the LRO…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="lro_apollo11overview" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/lro_apollo11overview.jpg?w=540&amp;amp;h=540" alt="lro_apollo11overview" width="540" height="540"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to the Rogues at the &lt;a href="http://theskepticsguide.org"&gt;Skeptic’s Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; and Phil Plait at the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy"&gt;Bad Astronomy blog&lt;/a&gt; for giving me the heads up on these new photos from the LRO.  Incidentally, Phil has a really detailed blog post on this new development – &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/09/one-giant-leap/"&gt;I recommend you check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be interesting to see what sort of reaction the Moon hoax CTers will have to this news, seeing as how it addresses a critical claim they’ve been making all along (that no direct photos of the Apollo landing sites exist).  Of course, I predict that the CTers will engage in all manner of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Special_pleading"&gt;special pleading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Moving_the_Goalposts"&gt;goalpost moving&lt;/a&gt; to explain away this damning evidence – even going so far as to appeal to the conspiracy theory (i.e. NASA &lt;em&gt;faked&lt;/em&gt; the photos) to rationalize their delusions.  Such thinking displays the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Falsifiability"&gt;unfalsifiable&lt;/a&gt; nature of conspiracy theories and shows how misguided &amp;amp; separated from reality these folks can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that’ll go over so well… many college students (though not all) are capable of thinking for themselves and that’s not good for Cameron or Comfort, who need you to follow them where the evidence doesn’t lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many affiliates of the Secular Student Alliance are &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2799"&gt;planning events around the misinformation campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Comfort and Cameron would be better off reaching out to people who won’t rebut their claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Speech Gene", of course, is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2"&gt;FOXP2&lt;/a&gt;, and Wade's article covers a paper by Genevieve Konopka et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7270/abs/nature08549.html"&gt;Human-specific transcriptional regulation of CNS development genes by FOXP2&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 462: 213-217, 11/12/2009. We've been &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=001269089414569134552%3Aqvjtfauf7ou&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=FOXP2&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;muttering&lt;/a&gt; on this weblog for more than five years about the overselling of  FOXP2 as &amp;quot;the Language Gene&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;the Speech Gene&amp;quot; — for a recent summary of the issues, see &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1478"&gt;Mice with the 'language gene' stay mum&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1482"&gt;More on FOXP2&lt;/a&gt;", 6/5/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt; took up the cognitive aspects of the "gene for X" question in an excellent special issue in 2006, ("Genes, Brain and Cognition: A Roadmap for the Cognitive Scientist"). An articles that specifically discusses the FOXP2 evidence, as it existed in 2006, is &lt;a href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/simon-e-fisher-homepage"&gt;Simon Fisher&lt;/a&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2006.04.004"&gt;Tangled webs: Tracing the connections between genes and cognition&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt; 101(2): 270-297, September 2006):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[T]he deceptive simplicity of  finding correlations between genetic and phenotypic variation has led  to a common misconception that there exist straightforward linear  relationships between specific genes and particular behavioural and/or  cognitive outputs. The problem is exacerbated by the adoption of an  abstract view of the nature of the gene, without consideration of  molecular, developmental or ontogenetic frameworks. […] Genes do not specify behaviours or cognitive processes; they make regulatory factors, signalling molecules, receptors, enzymes, and so on, that interact in highly complex networks, modulated by environmental influences, in order to build and maintain the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fisher is the scientist who first identified the role of FOXP2 in speech and language impairment. See also the discussion of FOXP2 in Evan Balaban, "&lt;a href="http://dpblab.fiu.edu/courses/psy5058_balaban2006.pdf"&gt;Cognitive Developmental Biology: History, Process, and Fortune's Wheel&lt;/a&gt;", in the same issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Konopka et al. paper is entirely in line with this perspective. Human FOXP2 differs from Chimpanzee FOXP2 in just two amino acids, and so, as Konopka et al. explain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To test whether the amino acids under positive selection in human FOXP2 have a distinct biological function, which would support the role of these changes in evolution, we expressed either human FOXP2 or the same construct mutated at two sites to yield the chimpanzee amino acid content, FOXP2&lt;sup&gt;chimp&lt;/sup&gt;, in human neuronal cells without endogenous FOXP2. […] To determine if modifying two amino acids leads to changes in gene expression, we conducted whole-genome microarray analysis. We identified 61 genes significantly upregulated and 55 genes downregulated by FOXP2 compared to FOXP2&lt;sup&gt;chimp&lt;/sup&gt; […] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To place these gene expression changes within a more systematic context, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis […] to examine co-regulation of gene expression across all genes. We uncovered two modules where the module eigengene […] was driven by differences in FOXP2 and FOXP2&lt;sup&gt;chimp&lt;/sup&gt;, and one module driven by similar gene regulation […] Notably, two of the genes with the most connections, so-called &amp;#39;hub&amp;#39; genes, in one of the differential networks are DLX5 and SYT4, two genes important for brain development and function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's their figure of "one of the modules containing FOXP2 and FOXP2&lt;sup&gt;chimp&lt;/sup&gt; differentially expressed genes":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/KonopkaFig3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/KonopkaFig3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this research supports the idea that the hominin mutation in FOXP2 has a biological effect, and perhaps an important one, apparently involving the interaction of a large number of genes with a large number of developmental and functional roles. It remains to be seen how this relates to human/chimp differences in anatomy, physiology, and behavior; and especially, what it has to do with speech, language, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Wade's first sentence calls  FOXP2 "a gene that underlies the faculty of human speech", and his second sentence is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;All animals have an FOXP2 gene, but the human version’s product differs at just 2 of its 740 units from that of chimpanzees, suggesting that this tiny evolutionary fix may hold the key to why people can speak and chimps cannot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done his best to steer his readers along exactly the mistaken path that Simon Fisher warned against ("any characterisation of this as a 'gene for grammar' (or even as a 'gene for language') clearly becomes untenable once we are able to view it within a more complete biological framework"), Wade is then forced by the facts into a somewhat different narrative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[T]hey confirmed suspicions that FOXP2 was a maestro of the genome … Like the conductor of an orchestra, the gene quiets the activity of some and summons a crescendo from others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it's been known since its discovery that FOXP2, like the rest of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"&gt;FOX&lt;/a&gt; family, is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"&gt;transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Several of the genes under FOXP2’s thumb show signs of having faced recent evolutionary pressure, meaning they were favored by natural selection. This suggests that the whole network of genes has evolved together in making language and speech a human faculty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And some of the genes in FOXP2’s network have already been implicated in diseases that include disorders of speech, confirming its importance in these faculties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But the FOXP2 network is certainly not the only set of genes involved in language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, he didn't add, language is not the only thing that the FOXP2 network is involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "God Gene" is a different story altogether. To start with, it doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's basically nonsense to call FOXP2 the "language gene" or the "speech gene", but at least FOXP2 exists, and is involved in the development of various anatomical structures that play a role in spoken language (as well in eating, breathing, etc.); and a FOXP2 mutation is known to be associated with developmental disorders that are partly linguistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Wade's "God Gene" is entirely hypothetical. No one has discovered a family of atheists whose lack of interest in spiritual transcendence can be linked to a shared genomic variation. So what's the argument that there's a  gene-for-belief-in-a-higher-power? Let's let Wade &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/weekinreview/12wade.html"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;IN the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico, the archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery have gained a remarkable insight into the origin of religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;During 15 years of excavation they have uncovered not some monumental temple but evidence of a critical transition in religious behavior. The record begins with a simple dancing floor, the arena for the communal religious dances held by hunter-gatherers in about 7,000 B.C. It moves to the ancestor-cult shrines that appeared after the beginning of corn-based agriculture around 1,500 B.C., and ends in A.D. 30 with the sophisticated, astronomically oriented temples of an early archaic state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This and other research is pointing to a new perspective on religion, one that seeks to explain why religious behavior has occurred in societies at every stage of development and in every region of the world. Religion has the hallmarks of an evolved behavior, meaning that it exists because it was favored by natural selection. It is universal because it was wired into our neural circuitry before the ancestral human population dispersed from its African homeland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the "God gene" is a completely hypothetical just-so story, with two components. The first is the theory that religion was culturally advantageous in the circumstances of early human evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The ancestral human population of 50,000 years ago, to judge from living hunter-gatherers, would have lived in small, egalitarian groups without chiefs or headmen. Religion served them as an invisible government. It bound people together, committing them to put their community’s needs ahead of their own self-interest. For fear of divine punishment, people followed rules of self-restraint toward members of the community. Religion also emboldened them to give their lives in battle against outsiders. Groups fortified by religious belief would have prevailed over those that lacked it …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no evidence for several aspects of this, but it&amp;#39;s a plausible argument in favor of … cultural evolution? No, Wade (and some others) want this lesson to have been learned genetically, not culturally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[G]enes that prompted the mind toward ritual would eventually have become universal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty part is the universality of this argument. My current favorite application  leads us to postulate the Hat Gene. (OK, the Head-Covering Gene — but Wade should really be writing about &amp;quot;the spirituality gene&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the transcendence gene&amp;quot;, since &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; is hardly a cultural universal. So I&amp;#39;m going to stick with my Hat Gene, since it&amp;#39;s catchier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the manifold advantages of head-coverings to paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and the near-universality of head coverings among human groups at all subsequent stages of development — the Hat Gene hypothesis is a winner all around. Still, I doubt that I could get funding for a Genome-Wide Association study looking for correlations with preferences in haberdashery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, there's Wade's new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Faith-Instinct-Religion-Evolved-Endures/dp/1594202281/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Faith Instinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published Nov. 11, 2009. I'm holding out for &lt;em&gt;The Hat Instinct&lt;/em&gt;, myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258334233987"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/husdalcom/~3/jpfBCm_n10I/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/46d033e6a43889d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Supply, Demand, and…”Miscellanous” Risk?</title><published>2009-11-15T18:01:03Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T18:01:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ZpNeaTFZesY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/husdalcom/~3/jpfBCm_n10I/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I’ve said so before, sometimes new articles are found in new and unlikely places.

At its "Appeal to Heaven" fundraiser, You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International offered attendees a preview of its new documentary, a greeting by Rep. Michele Bachmann and a fiery sermon by founder Bradlee Dean, who called liberals "criminals" and urged attendees to fight a "war" for the faith against liberals.

&lt;p&gt;The almost exclusively white crowd had assembled at the Sheraton ballroom in Bloomington to raise funds for the ministry and its outreach to public high schools across the Midwest, a practice that some civil liberties groups say violates the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/more_violent_christian_rhetori.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/more_violent_christian_rhetori.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/MYiPrZbEs6Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258319461392"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=2012">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42ad84c9810b80e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Home stuff"/><category term="Random Thoughts"/><title type="html">We live interesting (albeit grungy) lives</title><published>2009-11-15T21:10:13Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T21:10:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/we-live-interesting-albeit-grungy-lives/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">My daughter just remarked, “Swords, teapots and rubber duckies — wow, that Bon Ami is great stuff!”

&lt;p&gt;If you go either to the page that lists all the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Workshops/" title=""&gt;Friday morning Workshops&lt;/a&gt; or the main Saturday/Sunday &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;Program page&lt;/a&gt; you will see that each session has a title, names (and links to homepages) of moderators and a brief description. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can also see that at the end of each description there is a link that says "Discuss here". If you click on any of those links, you will be transported to the individual wiki page of that particular session/demo/workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderators have been asked to use those individual pages. They may expand the description so it's longer. They may put their notes there. Or add important links. Or add/link/embed important files. They may ask questions: what do you want discussed there? And they will answer your questions if you put them there - just edit the page and ask. An entire discussion may (and hopefully will) occur on that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you blog about a particular session, or write an MSM piece about it, or have images or audio/video files of it, please remember to post the permalink on that session's page as well. We want these pages to be archives of what happens at the conference. As we'll try to livestream and record all sessions, we'll also link or embed the recordings on the individual pages as well - a record for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference lasts, in physical space, only about three days. But each and every session can have a much longer life, on its individual wiki page, both before and after the meeting. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Manufactroversy (măn’yə-făk’-trə-vûr’sē)
 N., pl. -sies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 1. A manufactured controversy that is motivated by profit or extreme ideology to intentionally create public confusion about an issue that is not in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Effort is often accompanied by imagined conspiracy theory and major marketing dollars involving fraud, deception and polemic rhetoric.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all the sophisticated sophistry besieging mass audiences today, there is a need for the study of rhetoric now more than ever before. This is especially the case when it comes to the contemporary assault on science known as manufactured controversy: when significant disagreement doesn’t exist inside the scientific community, but is successfully invented for a public audience to achieve specific political ends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, Stephen at &lt;a href="http://granades.com/"&gt;Live Granades&lt;/a&gt; has written a &lt;a href="http://granades.com/2009/11/11/how-to-generate-scientific-controversy/"&gt;how-to manual&lt;/a&gt; -- well, a manualette:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. Pick something that is regarded as true by the vast majority of scientists in the field and claim that it causes something bad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2. Demand that scientists prove a negative by showing that the good thing doesn’t actually have bad results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
3. When people point out that the facts don’t back up your claim, ignore them. As those people get angry and shouty at you, smugly say, “They’re persecuting me! They’re so closed-minded that they won’t let anyone ask questions!” Bonus points for saying that science is now a religion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
4. If more patient scientists perform studies that undermine your claim, or if you manage to get the government to modify the good thing to fix what you were complaining about, move the goalposts!
&lt;/p&gt;

Now, on the front page of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on November 14, a story ("&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/business/media/14vulgar.html"&gt;It Turns Out You Can Say That On Television, Over and Over&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, by Edward Wyatt) about expressions that don&amp;#39;t reach the level of obscenity or profanity but are offensive to many people — and have now been appearing with increasing frequency on television (in prime-time network series), where they can serve as approximations to even stronger stuff.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is famously modest in the vocabulary it allows in its pages (though it sometimes slips up), an editorial position that can make some stories hard to report on; see Ben Zimmer's entertaining &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=349"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; "Times bowdlerizes column on Times bowdlerization", which includes a link to a &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2139453/"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Jesse Sheidlower on the time SCUMBAG slipped into a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; crossword puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyatt's story mentions the insult &lt;em&gt;douche &lt;/em&gt;but skirts &lt;em&gt;douchebag&lt;/em&gt;, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of the recently popular word "douche" defend its use, noting that it was invoked, usually with the suffix "bag," [not actually a suffix, of course] in the 1990s by the character Andy Sipowicz on "NYPD Blue," an ABC series that frequently pushed the boundaries of network acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then in a quote from cursing scholar Timothy Jay, we get the full word: "I would bet most kids today couldn't tell you what a douche bag is."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides &lt;em&gt;douche&lt;/em&gt;, the article reports on the use of &lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jackass&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt; on prime-time network television. Those are things you can print in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; (though I think the paper is still averse to &lt;em&gt;scumbag&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists have a very fixed view of the world – literally and figuratively. They have The Truth – it’s written in a series of manuscripts that were produced by various tiny Middle Eastern sects 2-3 millennia ago, which were eventually sifted and sorted and mistranslated into a set of what were deemed to be acceptable views to a group of Church leaders around 1500 years ago. All they have to do is to read it, and The Truth is obvious – God created all species, so there can be no evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, however, doesn’t claim to have The Truth. We simply have the best approach to reality that we can have, based on the available evidence. If we were to find fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian, then we would all have to backtrack on the phrase that forms the title of this blog. However, there comes a point at which the absence of contradictory evidence, and the overwhelming weight of supporting evidence, leads us to stop pussy-footing around. We abandon all that philosophical bet-hedging and simply state “evolution is true”. If the fossil rabbits ever turn up (don’t hold your breath), we’ll revisit the statement – as the French say, only imbeciles don’t change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of getting to such clarity, scientists spend a lot of time arguing, doing experiments that occasionally have contradictory results, and trying to figure out who in the resulting intellectual battle is actually right. It’s part of what makes science fun. Whenever these kind of debates arise – be they in evolutionary biology or climate science, to take two targets of certain sections of the blogosphere and of conservatives – they are immediately taken to be proof that there is “a crisis”. This is particularly irritating when the views that are supposed to be evidence of “the jury being out” in fact represent a tiny minority. Sometimes this can have dreadful consequences. There are some fools and charlatans who claim that AIDS is not caused by HIV. Tragically, they have had a great impact on the policy of the South African government. That does not mean that there is any kind of “debate” or “crisis” over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of this kind of claim has come, unsurprisingly, in the wake of the article by Donald Williamson on the evolution of caterpillars, and its recent utter and total debunking by Hart &amp;amp; Grosberg, which has been dealt with extensively&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/controversal-paper-on-origins-of-caterpillars-debunked/"&gt; by Jerry on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Brian Thomas, “a Science Writer at the Institute for Creation Research” has &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/5003/"&gt;posted an article &lt;/a&gt;which claims that the Williamson study and its trashing “discloses deep evolutionary disagreement”. He concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Beneath the veneer of a controversial peer-review process is a substantial debate over the very basics of evolution. Some scientists have pointed out that neo-Darwinism is inadequate to explain why life forms appear fully-equipped, unique, and discrete. One of these bravely offered hybridogenesis as an alternative evolutionary mechanism. Others cogently demonstrated some scientific deal-breakers for hybridogenesis. Perhaps both sides are correct in their assessments of the opposing evolutionary ideas—neither explanation is sufficient. And if life could not have evolved, it must have been created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas may be a “science writer”, but he’s surely no scientist! No one with a scrap of scientific insight could read the article by Hart and Grosberg and not be totally and utterly convinced that they are right and Williamson was completely wrong. That’s the power of science – we determine our views on the basis of the evidence. Thomas, along with all other creationists, can’t allow himself to do that, or he’d come round to reality – life was not created, it evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hi Dr. Isis,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm looking for your thoughts, as a scientist, educator, and mother, on how to address some gender issues that seem to have come up among one of undergrads for whom I TA. I'm teaching a special topics course, which is attached to our Intro Psychology course, and focuses on TV viewing and child development, from infancy through adolescence - focusing in different weeks on aggression, language development, academic achievement, eating behavior, sleeping behavior, and sexual activity. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Part of the idea is to present them with journal articles (likely their first exposure to original research) and I ask them for 1-page reading responses each week. I gave them one of the classic papers on the negative effects of TV viewing, particularly with respect to aggression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here are the relevant points from one of my students' responses (which i have summarized to distill the main points):&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. Watching violent television is beneficial for boys.&lt;br&gt;2. Watching this sort of TV programming allows boys to feel masculine, and can develop a sense of masculinity in them.&lt;br&gt;3. Without such development of masculinity, many boys will grow up to be too sensitive &lt;br&gt;4. Men and women were made for different reasons: men for the more "rugged things" in life and women to "help children develop their sensitive side," to care, and to nurture.&lt;br&gt;5. Without a little bit of violent television, some kids could miss out on learning this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Without getting into the particulars on whether or not there is a relationship between violent TV viewing and aggression in children, and whether or not there are gender differences in that relationship (check out the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdh7MngntnI"&gt;Albert Bandura Bobo Doll experiment&lt;/a&gt; which shows the girls reacting with the same aggression as the boys)... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the appropriate way for me - in a position of authority and power as a TA - to address this with this student? Should I address it at all?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;[Dude's name redacted a la Isis]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to get to [redacted]'s excellent question in a moment, but first I have to say that I am &lt;em&gt;fascinated&lt;/em&gt; by the video that he included in his letter. Utterly, utterly fascinated. In this video there are people going totally Tony Soprano on this bobo doll, and Albert Bandura made a documentary using the footage. Now it's on YouTube. I can't imagine the participants consented to that. I also know there is no way &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"&gt;our IRB&lt;/a&gt; would let us get away with stuff like that now...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="DISPLAY:inline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/consent.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="DISPLAY:block;MARGIN:0pt auto 20px;TEXT-ALIGN:center" height="459" alt="consent.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2009/11/consent-thumb-450x459-22244.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cancerboard.ab.ca/polyomx/images/consent.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: "Alright, kid. I'm gonna to need you to sign here. Then we'll let you take a hammer to that creepy doll for a while. Then we're gonna put the video up on YouTube. It'll come up in searches with that kid who wants us to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc"&gt;leave Britney alone&lt;/a&gt; and videos of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F35L1dZtxjI"&gt;Kim Kardashian eating a popscicle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, surely, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to start by doing a little bit of editing to this adorable little muffin's letter so that we can begin from a more productive place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm looking for your thoughts, as a scientist [and] educator &lt;strike&gt;and mother&lt;/strike&gt;, on how to address some gender issues that seem to have come up among one of undergrads for whom I TA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how my role as a mother qualifies me to address this question, unless you think a couple verses of The Wheels on the Bus, a trip to the zoo, and a Spongebob Squarepants Band-Aid is going to fix this kid&amp;#39;s problem.  Otherwise, I got nothing for you. If you start wetting the bed, [redacted], you can write to me as a mother.  Otherwise, let&amp;#39;s move on and address this like the scientists that we all are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feminist in me reads what [redacted]&amp;#39;s student wrote and wants to stomp my adorable shoes and say, &amp;quot;No!  Boys and girls are just the same!&amp;quot;  But, that&amp;#39;s not going to do me and my adorable shoes any good, is it?  Let me, instead, focus on this....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the appropriate way for me - in a position of authority and power as a TA - to address this with this student? Should I address it at all?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What would you do, [redacted], if I were in your class and I wrote a paper in which my central thesis was that the moon is made of cheese?  I imagine that you would call me on it and either respond with evidence to the contrary, or demand that I provided evidence of such tomfoolery.   My thinking is that this is how you handle this situation -- you handle it the same way as any other situation in which a student submitted complete bullshit.  Call it.  Ignore the fact that it is pure misogynist propaganda and just call it for the scientific nonsense it is.  If he wants to press on with it, let him gather his sources and fight back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If he watched enough violent television as a child, he'll be really good at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/ask_dr_isis_-_how_do_i_handle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/vdiOkE-_BnU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258305613179"><id gr:original-id="http://calvinus.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/recharge-your-batteries/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dea350e20f4f82d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Recharge Your Batteries</title><published>2009-11-15T10:10:44Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T10:10:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Oz7JFitcH0g/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://calvinus.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/recharge-your-batteries/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">New materials to make batteries with might actually rival petrol for energy storage capacity....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D.C. Council is considering a law forbidding discrimination against those in gay marriages. The law would apply to all groups that have contracts with the District, including Catholic Charities, one of the city's largest social services providers. The Archdiocese of Washington says that because of the Church's opposition to same-sex marriage, it would have to suspend its social services to the poor, the homeless and others rather than provide employee benefits to same-sex married couples or allow them to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://views.washingtonpost.com/post-user-polls/2009/11/dc-council-vs-the-catholic-church.html?hpid=talkbox1"&gt;Should the city require the Church to follow a law it considers immoral?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes 18%&lt;br&gt;
No 82%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should what the church &lt;i&gt;considers&lt;/i&gt; immoral to be a relevant factor? I could consider the wearing of pants to be immoral, or even better, going to church to be immoral…but it doesn&amp;#39;t make it so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/a_poll_on_the_catholic_opposit.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jZ7T7og1NLA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258304085871"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3616">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/153ddf8700780aa3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Rising Rates of Autism in the Age of Modern Medicine</title><published>2009-11-15T15:47:21Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T15:47:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/jlmxDtgNGw4/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Emily L.

I still have to transcribe my notes from yesterday; I'll plan on getting that done on the plane this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kristi Montooth: Mitochondrial-nuclear epistasis for metabolic fitness in flies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do physiological systems evolve to maintain metabolic fitness? This is a process that involves interactions between two genomes, the nuclear and mitochondrial. Energy metabolism is important and is the target of mutation, but the same players are found all across the tree of life, suggesting that there is also strong selective pressure to maintain a common system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montooth is looking at inducible gene expression: is there an energetic cost to switch genes off and on? She's using respirometers that can measure the metabolic rate of single flies or larva. Flies are subjected to heat shock, which switches on HSP70.  Flies normally have 6 copies of HSP70; they have mutants with 12, and they show a much greater rise in metabolic rate in response to heat shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the source of the energy for this response. Mitochondria also have a high mutation rate and show strong linkage (no sexual recombination to cover for errors that arise). She's arguing for selection for compensatory evolution in the nuclear genome, and the accumulation of intergenomic epistasis. To dissect the effects of coevolution of mitochondria and nuclear genomes, she transplanted mitochondria from different species into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. These have between 18 and 100 amino acid substitutions from the Dmel sequence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She plots mitochondrial genome in order of increasing divergence against measured fitness (she used a competition assay that she did not describe in detail). There is no correlation seen at all. Also, high fitness X/mtDNA genotypes in one sex can be low fitness genotypes in the other sex. Interactions between the X and mtDNA can maintain variation in both genomes. All of the fitness effects, with one exception, are subtle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the transgenomic effects have very strong effects on female fecundity, developmental rates, and locomotion. But adult metabolic rate shows no difference! The idea is that there are lots of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain metabolism very tightly, which then have secondary effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Johanna Schmitt: Adaptive evolution of Arabidopsis flowering pathways in different climates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schmitt does ecological development, looking at the timing of plant development in different environments. How does phenology respond and adapt to climate variation? We expect evolution to adapt to variation in seasonal timing. The signaling pathways in Arabidopsis are well known; they respond to hormones, photoperiod, and ambient temperature by way of a fairly complicated set of pathways she showed us in a slide...sorry, no way I can reproduce it here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across its range, it shows a great deal of life history variation; one pattern in the Mediterranean, another in colder northern climes, and yet another in Northern Scandinavia, varying in how much time they spend in vegetative rosettes vs. bolting and flower production. Questions: are there are genetic variants associated with different life history patterns, can they identify the genes, and can they perturb them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiments involved massive plantings in different sites in Europe with different climates, with different mutants. Is natural variation in candidate genes involved in variation in flowering time? They studied &lt;i&gt;FRIGIDA&lt;/i&gt;, a gene that effects the vernalization pathway. When you lose &lt;i&gt;FRIGIDA&lt;/i&gt;, you should see much more rapid flowering. Loss of function in this gene has evolved multiple times in northwestern Europe. The effect depends on the timing of planting and climate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of the mutant varies across geography, and they have a photothermal model of flowering time. The plants are tracking light and temperature, and the different mutants are counting up these inputs in slightly different ways. They can use this model to make predictions on the effects of &lt;i&gt;FRIGIDA&lt;/i&gt; on flowering time with changes in germination timing, and then test these in the next year with plantings at different times and in their different geographical sites, and the model is working accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also plugging in predicted future climate change from NOAA, and asking what we can expect to see 100 years from now; she showed maps of expected flowering times in 2100. They are also making predictions of the expected distributions of &lt;i&gt;FRIGIDA&lt;/i&gt; alleles over time, and they hope to do the same for many other alleles in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artyom Kopp: How the fly got its sexy legs - the origin and evolution of Drosophila sex combs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sex comb is a male specific structure on the front legs which most Drosophila species lack -- it's a fairly recent innovation. How do you evolve a novel structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s limited to the melanogaster and obscura species groups, with quite a bit of diversity in different species, varying from 2-50 teeth, location, and arrangement. How do you go from sexually monomorphic state of a generically hairy leg to one with a specific bristle arrangement in males? The sex comb in males is homologous to a subset of bristles also found in females; in males, that patch of epidermis rotates 90° and the bristles enlarge. He showed a very pretty developmental series of this epithelium undergoing cell shape changes that move the bristles to a new location. Other species show similar morphological remodeling, but sometimes with some significant differences: D. kikkawai doesn&amp;#39;t do the rotation, but instead the bristle precursors arise in their final position. These modes do not cluster together phylogenetically, so these are examples of convergent evolution, generating similar structures with different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are taking apart the genetics and regulatory inputs of sex comb development. Basically, it involves just about everything. It seems to arise by an interaction between Hox and sex determination genes. Spatial modulation of &lt;i&gt;Sex combs reduced&lt;/i&gt; controls sex comb position.  &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; in pupa; stages is only expressed in a limited domain in the leg, and ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; produces multiple sex combs. Expression is also sexually dimorphic, with no upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; in female legs. In D. ficusphila, which has enormous sex combs, &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; levels are elevated yet further to 7 times the levels found in D. willistoni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sex determination gene &lt;i&gt;Double sex&lt;/i&gt; is also spatially patterned, and is refined and elevated to high levels in the area around the developing sex combs. Ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;Dsx&lt;/i&gt; induces ectopic sex combs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can a new developmental pathway evolve? In the ancestral condition, &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; is controlled by spatial cues to produce segmental patterns of bristles; in the sex-comb carrying species, &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; is coupled to &lt;i&gt;Dsx&lt;/i&gt;. This explains the spatial pattern of gene expression, but it also needs to acquire new downstream targets to, for instance, regulate epidermal rotations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drosophila are old, and many of these species differences are millions of years old. They are now looking at more recently diverged species with differences in sex comb morphology, and are looking for correlations between &lt;i&gt;Scr&lt;/i&gt; and species divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, I have to run for the airport shuttle. Good talks, and I unfortunately have to miss Rudy Raff's wrap-up of the meeting.&lt;p&gt;

As well as the typical and well described two-component signalling systems (a histadine-kinase sensor which senses a signal and passes this on to a response-regulator) bacteria also contain multi-component systems, for both inter- and intra-cellular signalling.All cells constantly monitor their external and internal environment in order to effectively exploit their surroundings. Bacteria are no different, and all contain a variety of different signal transduction pathways in order to do this. The  distribution of these transduction pathways varies between bacteria, based not just on phylogeny but lifestyle and environment as well. Galperin's study (reference below) looked at the distribution of bacterial signalling systems over 167 different genomes (including some archaea) to examine if there were any overall trends.The first trend he found was that the number of signal transduction pathways in a genome increases with genome size:Image taken from reference (1) belowThe graph above shows log[protein number] on the y-axis plotted against log[genome size] on the x-axis. There are exceptions, but the overall trend is that the two have a clear linear relationship: the more genes a bacteria has, the more of them it will dedicate to monitoring its internal and external surroundings.The second trend, which perhaps is not quite such a surprising find, is that the number of signal transduction pathways depends markedly on the surrounding environment. Ruminant bacteria (with a few exceptions) have smaller and simpler transduction pathways, with fewer external signals being reported. In contrast, facultative pathogens, which have diverse ecological niches, will have far more systems for  sensing their surroundings. This makes sense, as faculative anaerobes need to respond and react to the different environments in which they find themselves. Ruminant bacteria, which live their whole lives in the gut of ruminant mammals (such as sheep and cattle), only can survive in one environment, so have very little need for sophisticated sensor-response systems.It was also found that gram negative bacteria have a larger number of signalling systems than gram positive. This may be due to the fact that gram negative bacteria are motile, and therefore need to monitor what kind of environment they are moving into, and how their internal conditions are reacting to the change. It may also have something to do with the difference in cell wall structure. Gram negative cells have two cell membranes, with a glycoprotein layer in the middle (Gram positives are just glycoprotein all the way up) and are therefore more likely to have signalling systems with more than two componants, as the signal in some cases must be transmitted first through the outer membrane, and then through the inner.As well as looking at responses to extracellular conditions, the study also examined intracellular signalling pathways, the bacterial sensing of its internal conditions. Intracellular pathways followed different trends to extracellular ones, for example free-living archaea were found to have fewer extracellular signaling transduction pathways, but more intracellular ones. Cyanobacteria were found to have the largest number of intracellular pathways. A potential reason for this is that cyanobacteria are the only bacteria that produce oxygen, rather than trying to keep it outside the cell. Oxygen is dangerous, it produces reactive species and affects the overall redox balance inside the cell. Cyanobacteria therefore may need more signalling pathways to keep a close eye on the oxygen inside it's cell.The study also shows that, despite the evolutionary similarity to eukaryotic systems, there are some unique features within bacterial signalling systems (especially the lesser explored internal cell signalling). Many of these are shared by pathogenic bacteria, offering the potential for another target for bacteriocidal drugs, or at the very least drugs that prevent the growth and invasion of bacteria in the body, allowing the immune system time to safely remove them.---1)Galperin MY (2005).

Many of them result in someone getting very upset.  Sometimes, it results in a fight over faith — maybe a debate you don’t want to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do if you want to come out publicly as an atheist but not draw all the negative attention that sometimes comes with it?  Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Keith&lt;/strong&gt; is having that dilemma and he’s thinking about the best way to handle it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After reaching mid-life, I’ve realized I’m pretty tired of being a secret atheist.  Not that I pretend to be religious, but when religious topics come up at work or among friends, I tend to clam up and avoid the subject.  Lately, though, I’ve started to wonder if that’s the best stance for me to take.  I worry that I’m being a coward, and that if I spoke up for myself I might (like you’ve said before) show people by example that atheists are decent people too, and also let other closet atheists know that they are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I’ve thought about addressing this is by announcing my atheism on Facebook (as a friend did recently).  But is this too in-your-face?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say to the world that I’m not afraid to be called atheist, and that atheists are all around.  I don’t want it to come across as a challenge, like I’m saying “I’m an atheist… take that world!”  Especially because the vast majority of my Facebook friends are Christian, and at least half of those are Very Christian (and family members).  Most of them probably don’t know I’m an atheist.  (I suppose part of my motivation is that I’m reaching a point where I DO want those family members to know — mostly cousins — but I don’t want to talk to them directly about it.  That would feel like a confession of a dirty secret!  I just want to announce that I’m proud of who I am.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook thing seems innocuous enough.  Is there a better way to be public about your atheism without trying to generate controversy within your family?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For over 5 years Belle de Jour has been one of the most high-profile and successful anonymous bloggers. In her &lt;a href="http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, Belle talked about her experiences as a high-class London call girl. A book followed, then a popular &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_diary_of_a_call_girl"&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Belle &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6917260.ece"&gt;revealed herself&lt;/a&gt; as Brooke Magnanti to &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;. And that's Dr. Brooke Magnanti. She's a scientist.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
My first thought was: what a fantastic coup for the image of women in science. Despite what people think, women in science, and scientists in general, can like fashion, enjoy looking beautiful, have hopes, fears and money troubles. Take away the label of "scientist", and all that's left is... a woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important message to send when we try to promote careers in science to girls: you don't have to be weird, or geeky, or a maths genius, or stop washing your hair, to be a scientist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, you can still be so glamorous that Billie Piper would want to play you on tv. (There was Billie, thinking she'd made break from her geeky Dr Who role, whereas in fact she was playing a developmental neurotoxicologist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4596662.stm"&gt;image problem of science&lt;/a&gt; is not limited to women. Male scientists suffer from stereotyping just as much as female ones. Anyone else out there want to own up to their secret life as a quantum physicist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second reaction, however, was of dismay. Belle turned to prositution in the period between submitting her PhD thesis and taking her viva. Procedures for completing a PhD differ quite a bit between countries. In Britain, a "big book" style thesis is required, typically of around 200 pages or so, rather than a collection of research papers. Writing such a tome is a big job, and the research papers still have to be written as well in order to get a publication record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis is then sent to examiners, typically around 3 expert scientists from both inside and outside the candidate's own institute, who review the book in detail. The PhD exam takes the form of a viva, literally an "oral exam", between the committee and the cadidate, lasting a few hours. Finally, the examiners recommend that the candidate passes, immediately (rare), following minor (most common) or major changes (less common) to the thesis, or not at all (very rare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can take many months, during which the student's employment status is often sketchy at best. With PhD funding in Britain typically shorter than elsewhere, although efforts are being made to bring it in line with the US and Europe, these final stages often spill over the end of the funded period. And with competition for academic jobs as fierce as it is, employers prefer to hire candidates whose PhD's are a certainty, rather than a pending proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, it is not uncommon for PhD students to find themselves forced to take a job to avoid financial hardship, and end up sidetracked from science and unable to finish their PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was precisely Belle's predicament, and faced with eviction from her home, she decided to become an escort to supplement her income. This would leave her enough time to write, work and prepare for her viva while earning enough money to support herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Belle says she "didn't object to the concept" of getting paid for sex, and certainly deserves not to be judged for it, I'm sure whe would rather have avoided having to resort to it in the first place. This would not be an outrageous suggestion. Having just finished a PhD, she had just become one of the most highly-educated people in the country. Isn't education supposed to shield you from this kind of hardship? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are being told that their work is crucial for driving our knowledge-based economies, but are paid so little that they have to run up hefty debts, wait tables or turn tricks to make ends meet. Isn't it time young scientists received respect in a more tangible form, like jobs and money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only way we can ensure that the best scientists stay in science, and not just those for whose circumstances allowed them to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note on the media coverage of this case. I sincerely hope for Belle and her loved ones that she receives a fairer treatment than several other bloggers (like &lt;a href="http://www.girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.com/"&gt;Girl with a One Track Mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Jack"&gt;Night Jack&lt;/a&gt;) who wrote under the veil of anonymity and were outed and subsequently hounded by the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While so far the coverage is mild and generally complimentary of Belle, and having decided to out herself has the advantage of holding the strings for now. I hope she hangs on to them. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sarah</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258283514363"><id gr:original-id="783 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/04eb3084975bb517</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Sins of the Mothers</title><published>2009-11-15T10:55:48Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T10:55:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/783" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; In ‘The Merchant of Venice’ Lancelot tells the Jewish convert to Christianity, Jessica, that there is no mercy for her in heaven as she is the daughter of two Jews. Her only hope is that her mother got her with another man. In Lancelot's worldview, Jessica’s actions in life clearly cannot eradicate her ancestry on one hand, nor her mother’s adultery on the other. She says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That were a kind of bastard hope indeed, so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June this year, the Court of Appeal found that the Jewish Free School in Brent had discriminated against a child on racial grounds. The school has an excellent Ofsted ranking, is constantly oversubscribed and is able, under the present rules, to pick and choose its pupils when there is a surplus of candidates. At the JFS, there always is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with ‘child M’ is that his father was born Jewish, but his mother is a convert. The Office of the Chief Rabbi does not recognise her conversion as valid, since the ritual was performed under Progressive, rather than Orthodox, auspices. Child M is an observant Jew, as are the members of his immediate family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not the practice - it’s the paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Pannick QC, for the school, which operates under Orthodox rules, argued that the discrimination was not ethnic: “… a faith school is entitled to adopt an oversubcription policy that gives priority to those children who are members of the religious faith as defined by the religious authority of the faith.” And the ‘religious authority of the faith’ here clearly likes to maintain a good degree of control over the validity of conversion rites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this tortured issue is difficult, and even distasteful, to a modern, liberal mind for a few reasons. They revolve around the issue of identity in a modern context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is the ethnic element – and there undoubtedly is one. Dinah Rose QC, representing child M, has pointed out that the JFS would accept a child of ethnically Jewish atheists but exclude others with non-Jewish mothers even when they were “Jewish by belief and practice”. And it occurs to me that as the OCR normally holds Jewishness to be matrilineal, this problem would presumably not arise with an ‘improperly’ converted father; his ethnicity would be irrelevant in relation to his child’s religious identity. So there are gender equality issues too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I think it jars with the modern trend to individuality, the permission to ‘self-declare’. We would resist being told which football team to support, which way to vote and which clothes to wear. We create our identities by our choices and we expect to be able to choose our religion: “Jesus is my saviour”, “There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God”; it’s unusual, in a modern context, to be excluded from a group after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an historical tradition of religions as guilds – protected organisations where you were ‘admitted’ rather than where you ‘joined’. Initiation into the Mithraic Mysteries was influenced by your class and profession (and certainly by your gender). Entering a medieval religious house was also encumbered, as you usually needed to bring money with you. Perhaps it’s a sign of demand that a group can afford to be so picky. It isn't a particularly modern model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is a modern sense that as an individual, you should pay the price of your own mistakes and benefit from the bounty of your own successes. We aren’t supposed to inherit sins or privilege. Horace’s "For the sins of your fathers you, though guiltless, must suffer" is often sadly true - babies are born with defects from alcoholic mothers, for example. But in a modern context it’s an sometimes admission of regrettable causality, not a mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there is a class of indentured labourers in modern Pakistan called the haari who have been likened, even by organisations as august as the UN, to slaves. They are landless peasants with debts to pay before they gain their liberty, but these debts are not self-incurred. When a child of a few months has a debt that will take years to pay off, we have a sense that he is a different case than a man who has just blown the equity on his house in a poker game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appeal Court in June appears to have judged that the tradition matrilineal test of Jewishness was by definition discriminatory: whether “benign or malignant, theological or supremacist” this “makes it no less and no more unlawful.” “The requirement that if a pupil is to qualify for admission his mother must be Jewish, whether by descent or conversion, is a test of ethnicity which contravenes the Race Relations Act”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pointed out that: “If for theological reasons a fully subscribed Christian faith school refused to admit a child on the ground that, albeit practising Christians, the child’s family were of Jewish origin, it is hard to see what answer there could be to a claim for race discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has certainly created a great deal of discussion within the Jewish community and there are probably significant splits of opinion between different groups, not least between the liberal and orthodox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school went to the Supreme Court to ‘appeal against the appeal’* at the end of last month. We await the final outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, the point of the matter is that in our own times, we expect a person to be defined by their practice rather than their provenance. It seems that the fact of this court action has achieved this in some measure, as the JFS’s new admissions policy gives weight to charitable works and attending the synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I support the BHA’s call to phase out religious schools “unless they too can be persuaded to become inclusive and accommodating institutions”. Where tax-payers' money is involved, it seems only fair. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Jourdemayne</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258282838136"><id gr:original-id="783 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82e721dab75373e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="admissions policy" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1099"/><category term="Appeal Court" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1097"/><category term="BHA" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/784"/><category term="Jewish Free School" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1096"/><category term="state-funded religious education" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1100"/><category term="Supremem Court" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1098"/><category term="Law" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/politics/law"/><category term="Religion" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/religion"/><title type="html">The Sins of the Mothers</title><published>2009-11-15T10:55:48Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T10:55:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/783" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; In ‘The Merchant of Venice’ Lancelot tells the Jewish convert to Christianity, Jessica, that there is no mercy for her in heaven as she is the daughter of two Jews.

For over 5 years Belle de Jour has been one of the most high-profile and successful anonymous bloggers. In her &lt;a href="http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, Belle talked about her experiences as a high-class London call girl. A book followed, then a popular &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_diary_of_a_call_girl"&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Belle &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6917260.ece"&gt;revealed herself&lt;/a&gt; as Brooke Magnanti to &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;. And that's Dr. Brooke Magnanti. She's a scientist.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
My first thought was: what a fantastic coup for the image of women in science. Despite what people think, women in science, and scientists in general, can like fashion, enjoy looking beautiful, have hopes, fears and money troubles. Take away the label of "scientist", and all that's left is... a woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important message to send when we try to promote careers in science to girls: you don't have to be weird, or geeky, or a maths genius, or stop washing your hair, to be a scientist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, you can still be so glamorous that Billie Piper would want to play you on tv. (There was Billie, thinking she'd made break from her geeky Dr Who role, whereas in fact she was playing a developmental neurotoxicologist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4596662.stm"&gt;image problem of science&lt;/a&gt; is not limited to women. Male scientists suffer from stereotyping just as much as female ones. Anyone else out there want to own up to their secret life as a quantum physicist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second reaction, however, was of dismay. Belle turned to prositution in the period between submitting her PhD thesis and taking her viva. Procedures for completing a PhD differ quite a bit between countries. In Britain, a "big book" style thesis is required, typically of around 200 pages or so, rather than a collection of research papers. Writing such a tome is a big job, and the research papers still have to be written as well in order to get a publication record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis is then sent to examiners, typically around 3 expert scientists from both inside and outside the candidate's own institute, who review the book in detail. The PhD exam takes the form of a viva, literally an "oral exam", between the committee and the cadidate, lasting a few hours. Finally, the examiners recommend that the candidate passes, immediately (rare), following minor (most common) or major changes (less common) to the thesis, or not at all (very rare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process can take many months, during which the student's employment status is often sketchy at best. With PhD funding in Britain typically shorter than elsewhere, although efforts are being made to bring it in line with the US and Europe, these final stages often spill over the end of the funded period. And with competition for academic jobs as fierce as it is, employers prefer to hire candidates whose PhD's are a certainty, rather than a pending proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, it is not uncommon for PhD students to find themselves forced to take a job to avoid financial hardship, and end up sidetracked from science and unable to finish their PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was precisely Belle's predicament, and faced with eviction from her home, she decided to become an escort to supplement her income. This would leave her enough time to write, work and prepare for her viva while earning enough money to support herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Belle says she "didn't object to the concept" of getting paid for sex, and certainly deserves not to be judged for it, I'm sure whe would rather have avoided having to resort to it in the first place. This would not be an outrageous suggestion. Having just finished a PhD, she had just become one of the most highly-educated people in the country. Isn't education supposed to shield you from this kind of hardship? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are being told that their work is crucial for driving our knowledge-based economies, but are paid so little that they have to run up hefty debts, wait tables or turn tricks to make ends meet. Isn't it time young scientists received respect in a more tangible form, like jobs and money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only way we can ensure that the best scientists stay in science, and not just those for whose circumstances allowed them to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note on the media coverage of this case. I sincerely hope for Belle and her loved ones that she receives a fairer treatment than several other bloggers (like &lt;a href="http://www.girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.com/"&gt;Girl with a One Track Mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Jack"&gt;Night Jack&lt;/a&gt;) who wrote under the veil of anonymity and were outed and subsequently hounded by the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While so far the coverage is mild and generally complimentary of Belle, and having decided to out herself has the advantage of holding the strings for now. I hope she hangs on to them. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Sarah</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.layscience.net/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.layscience.net/rss.xml</id><title type="html">The Lay Scientist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258281079144"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/clock_quotes_476.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10dfd702a7bd8780</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-11-15T09:10:54Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T09:10:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_kp4KfH5Gn4/clock_quotes_476.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/clock_quotes_476.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I sometimes think Thomas Cook should be numbered among the secular saints.

&lt;p&gt;[Apologies for cross-posting – this appeared last week over at&lt;a href="http://z-letter.com"&gt; z-letter.com&lt;/a&gt;, but I felt it could do with a wider outing!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, the Alvarez (père et fils) first suggested that an extraterrestrial impact caused the catastrophic climate changes that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs – and loads of other stuff – 65 MY ago. The location of that impact is now widely thought to have been the Chicxulub crater on the Yucutan Peninsula in Mexico. Other suspects for the death of the dinosaurs include the Deccan Traps, a massive area of igneous rock in India that is more than 2 km thick and covers 500,000 km2. These rocks, formed 60-68 MY ago, would have led to massive release of sulphur dioxide, which wouldn’t have made the climate any nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, over the last few years, &lt;a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/PaleoWebsite/chatterjee.html"&gt;Sankar Chatterjay of the Texas Technical University&lt;/a&gt;, has been arguing that  a submarine structure off the western coast of India, which he has called “Shiva”, is in fact a massive crater produced by a meteor strike. “Shiva” – if it exists – is 500 km across, and would be indicative of a a meteor about 40km wide – nearly 10 times larger than the estimated size of Chixculub object.&lt;/p&gt;

The overlying 4.3-mile-thick strata and water column were removed to show the morphology of the crater. Credit: Sankar Chatterjee, Texas Tech University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chatterjee recently presented his ideas at a meeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA), in a 15 minute talk. Here’s an extract from &lt;a href="http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_160197.htm"&gt;his abstract&lt;/a&gt; which describes the catastrophic consequences of such an impact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The impact was so powerful that it led to several geodynamic anomalies: it fragmented, sheared, and deformed the lithosphere mantle across the western Indian margin and contributed to major plate reorganization in the Indian Ocean. It initiated rifting between India and Seychelles in the west and created the Laxmi Ridge; it shattered the Indian plate easterly along the Narmada-Son Rift extending 1500 km across, dividing the Indian shield into a southern peninsular block and a northern foreland block. Because of topographic barrier of the Western Ghat Mountain range, the impact-triggered tsunami was restricted along the Narmada-Son Rift at the KT boundary. The relationships between large meteoritic impact, hotspot, flood basalt volcanism, plate tectonics, geodynamic anomalies, and sudden environmental catastrophe on Earth may open up a new field of unified investigation. Although the Reunion hotspot responsible for Deccan eruption was close to the Shiva crater in time and space, impact probably triggered a component of the Deccan Trap: the iridium-rich alkaline igneous complex rocks that were emplaced asymmetrically as a fluid ejecta at the KT boundary along the NE downrange direction of the bolide trajectory outside the crater ring. Two large impacts such as Shiva and Chicxulub in quick succession on the antipodal position, in concert with Deccan eruptions, would have devastating effects globally leading to climatic and environmental catastrophes that wiped out dinosaurs and many other organisms at the KT boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the non-geologist, it’s hard to know whether Chatterjee is right or not. In fact, it may be hard for the geologists, too, as this idea has been floating around since at least the 2003 meeting of the GSA, when&lt;a href="http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003AM/finalprogram/abstract_58126.htm"&gt; Chatterjee gave a similar talk&lt;/a&gt;. Although he published a paper in &lt;em&gt;Museum of Texas Tech University Special Publication&lt;/em&gt;s in 2006 (available &lt;a href="http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/publications/opapers/specpubs/SP50.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), this is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed in a major peer reviewed journal, to help the rest of us decide whether he’s really found evidence of what would be more than a smoking gun – it would be a veritable smoking howitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

Coffee

Could Stall Liver Disease Progression

By Kristina Fiore, Staff Writer, MedPage Today

Drinking three or more cups of coffee daily lowers the risk of liver

disease progression for patients with chronic hepatitis C, researchers

say.

Those who so indulged had a 53% decreased risk of disease progression,

compared with patients who didn&amp;#39;t drink coffee, Neal D. Freedman, MD,

of the National Cancer Institute, and colleagues reported in the

November issue of Hepatology.

&amp;quot;Although we cannot rule out a possible role for other factors that go

along with drinking coffee, results from our study suggest that

patients with high coffee intake had a lower risk of disease

progression,&amp;quot; Freedman said in a statement...

The capacity for empathy supposedly involves mirror neurons, those media darlings of The Young, [The Not-So-Young], and The Neuro:A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron &amp;quot;mirrors&amp;quot; the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting.These magical cells have even inspired famous neuroscientists to utter ridiculous hyperbole:The mirror neurons, it would seem, dissolve the barrier between self and others. I call them &amp;quot;empathy neurons&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dalai Llama neurons&amp;quot;.-- MIRROR EURONS AND THE BRAIN IN THE VAT  by V.S. Ramachandran Synesthesia for pain, a newly described syndrome, goes one step further (Fitzgibbon et al., 2009):In synaesthesia for pain a person not only empathises with another&amp;#39;s pain but experiences the observed or imagined pain as if it was their own. Neural mechanisms potentially involved in synaesthesia for pain include “mirror systems”: neural systems active both when observing an action, or experiencing an emotion or sensation and when executing the same action, or personally experiencing the same emotion or sensation. For example, we may know that someone is in pain in part because observation activates similar neural networks as if we were experiencing that pain ourselves. We propose that synaesthesia for pain may be the result of painful and/or traumatic experiences causing disinhibition in the mirror system underlying empathy for pain.And what is synesthesia, exactly? According to Edward M. Hubbard&amp;#39;s website, SYNESTHESIA can be defined as...an unusual conscious experience, in which stimulation of one sensory modality leads to a sensory experience in a second, unstimulated sensory modality. For example, seeing letters might lead some people to see colors. Others report that the days of the week or months of the year are arranged like a map in space. Still others report that hearing voices or music cause them to see colors, or that hearing words makes them taste foods...in fact, almost any sensory modality can be involved in synesthesia.One of the more common forms of synesthesia (illustrated above) is grapheme-color synesthesia, where numbers and letters are consistently associated with specific colors (Ward et al., 2005). A more unusual form is  lexical-gustatory synesthesia, in which spoken and written words elicit specific taste sensations that remain constant (Ward &amp;amp; Simner, 2003). For instance, Tony Blair tastes like desiccated coconut.According to the recent review of the literature by Fitzgibbon et al. (2009),  amputees with phantom limb pain comprise the vast majority of those with synaesthesia for pain:Known Characteristics of Synaesthesia for Pain in a Sample of Amputees with Phantom PainBrought on by viewing others in pain and/or observing pain on the television and in movies.Brought on both when observed pain matches that of the amputated site and/or any general painBrought on regardless of the identity of the observed person in pain, i.e. can be a loved one or a stranger.The experience is similar to the experiences of phantom pain, for example, described as a short sudden ‘electric shock’.Experienced in the phantom limb and/or stump.The researchers propose that:pain experiences may cause disinhibition of mechanisms underlying empathy for pain, resulting in synaesthesia for pain. This proposal is supported by studies that have found mirror activity to be involved in the pain matrix (e.g. Ochsner et al., 2008 and Singer et al., 2004); however, the specific processes that weaken these inhibitory mechanisms are unclear...Ultimately, in synaesthesia for pain, &amp;quot;there is no self–other distinction in the observation of pain in another person.&amp;quot;ReferencesFitzgibbon, B., Giummarra, M., Georgiou-Karistianis, N., Enticott, P., &amp;amp; Bradshaw, J.

In our field it can take quite a long time to get a paper all the way to publication; this one took longer than usual…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper describes the results of our search for Higgs bosons predicted in supersymmetric theories,  in the CDF experiment at Fermilab. Alas, we didn’t see any evidence for Higgs boson production, despite earlier &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/01/26/bump-huning-part-2/"&gt;hints that something might lurk in our sample&lt;/a&gt;, and so we were able to rule out some regions of supersymmetric parameter space. We first obtained a preliminary result from this analysis in late 2007.  A group of us from Rutgers University, University of Valencia, and UC Davis all worked directly on it, within our several-hundred-member collaboration, using Tevatron data recorded up through mid-2007. Since then we’ve more than tripled our data sample, but this result stuck with the data sample on which it was based and has finally reached publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis was the topic of the Ph.D. thesis of my student Cris Cuenca, who was formally a student of my former postdoc Juan Valls at University of Valencia.  Cris was a visitor in our group at UC Davis, and I was effectively his thesis advisor. After we got the preliminary results, Cris focused on writing his thesis, eventually defending it in Valencia in April 2008.  One nice effect of that was that I got to visit Valencia for the first time: what a fantastic city!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the thesis was done, it was clear we needed to publish the result formally. In fact, we should have been already writing the paper but as usual it’s hard to find time to get started on writing projects. Here is a place we could have saved some time, though…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote a draft after the birth of our son Ian in June 2008, while helping with baby care at home. In our collaboration there is a very formal review process before submitting a paper for publication.  The spokespeople of the collaboration “godparents” who perform a full internal review of the analysis and the draft of the paper. Without naming names, we got some very knowledgeable godparents who asked us hard questions. Some of these questions took weeks to answer, because more data analysis had to be performed. And some of them led to even more questions. This review process is a good thing — it ensures that the quality of the final paper is very high, and that the result is correct to the best of our ability. In fact, in the course of the review process we found that there was a minor software bug, and we repeated the full end stage of the analysis. As it turned out, the bug had very little effect on the final result but we needed to be sure. (At present there are only unknown bugs in the analysis software!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever there is a change to an analysis like this, it needs to be re-approved in our physics analysis group meetings, with two presentations: a “pre-blessing”, and then a “blessing” two weeks later.  (Hey, I’m not responsible for the pseudo-religious jargon used in this process…) This eventually happened in March 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the result final and the godparents happy with the paper draft, it was time for the general collaboration review. The collaboration gets two weeks to comment on each draft. Then the authors go through comment by comment and reply to the commenters,  modifying the draft as needed. The godparents reviewed our replies and then we arrive at the next draft.  This part of the process can take many weeks depending on how much time the authors have two devote to the paper.  Once the final draft stage is reached, a  “paper reading” is scheduled at the weekly general collaboration meeting. Following the presentation of the result, the collaboration has 48 hours before the paper is submitted to the journal. For us this happened, finally, in June of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard back from PRL in late July, with blind referee comments to address. There then ensued a back-and-forth between us and the referees, answering questions, making changes to our submission, and eventually reaching agreement that the paper would be published in PRL.  This happened a few weeks ago,  and our paper has now appeared in what I think is still considered to be the most prestigious journal in our field, though Nature possibly tops it.  (That might inspire a comment flame war but I hope not…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is an extreme example, and I certainly will endeavor to bring results to publication much more quickly in the future.  (I always say that.)   Certain results, if they are “hot”, can be published on a fast track in CDF, within weeks, but that is quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will, no doubt, argue that print media of almost every form is on the way out. Will this happen to print science journals?   I do think there is a strong need for blindly refereed publication of scientific results, even though many scientists have reviewed these papers by the time they are submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly  once the LHC experiments have physics results to publish, we will need a very rapid means of getting them into print.  For any striking new discovery we’ll want to have a paper submitted for publication when we announce the result…this is in contrast to the case of not-very-striking results, where we announce the results at conferences first and publish later.  The reason is that the experiments will try to establish scientific priority by publishing striking results before the other one does, but I have to wonder, in the modern age of electronic media and collaborations with thousands of members, whether simply announcing or presenting the the result in public doesn’t accomplish that anyway.  If ATLAS says they see a resonance in muon pairs at 1.5 TeV mass and so does CMS, the same week, will we really say “ATLAS found it first” or “ATLAS was the one to discover it and CDF confirmed it?”  I hope the science mainstream media don’t present such a thing that way…but more than that I just hope this is a problem we will actually face!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258266291207"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/41016761cbc4127e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">With Friends Like These</title><published>2009-11-15T05:02:45Z</published><updated>2009-11-15T05:02:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/774-with-friends-like-these.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Thy friendship oft has made my heart to ache: do be my enemy for friendship's sake." - William Blake&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="1._phil_and_his_shuttle" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/1._phil_and_his_shuttle.jpg" height="200" width="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

JREF President Phil Plait is an actual astronomer with an actual degree in nuclear telescopes or something. All I have going for me is several years of drinking away a scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even I, just by reading books and arguing with the neighborhood kids about moral relativism, know that saying a thing does not make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably no longer ‘the big news’, after seeing it on several news sites, mind…  But I did want to comment that in all of her writing, I wouldn’t have guessed this field of science was &lt;a href="http://www.belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/"&gt;Belle De-Jour’s&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6917495.ece"&gt;Dr Brooke Magnanti&lt;/a&gt;’s) speciality. You can find her &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2036437.ece"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rlz=1T4SUNA_enGB248GB248&amp;amp;q=site%3atelegraph.co.uk+%22retired+working+girl%22"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; in several publications; I did kind of think ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brad.ac.uk/admin/pr/pressreleases/2002/human.htm"&gt;has worked in computer science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘ after reading her more recent novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1227946/Is-Dr-Brooke-Magnanti-scientist-34-Belle-Jour.html"&gt;The Daily Mail:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…six years ago, as she struggled to complete her PhD thesis, &lt;a href="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8660/776276110764l1.jpg"&gt;Dr Magnanti&lt;/a&gt; is said to have run out of money and became a £300-a-night escort girl working in London. She began blogging anonymously about her activities on the internet under the pseudonym ‘&lt;a href="http://www.belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/"&gt;Belle de Jour&lt;/a&gt;‘.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her writing attracted millions of readers across the globe and its quality even sparked rumours that ‘Belle’ was a well-known author. Yet until last week not even her agent knew her real name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…In an interview in today’s Sunday Times, Dr Magnanti claims she was working on a doctoral study in the department of forensic pathology at Sheffield University when she took up prostitution in 2003. ‘I was getting ready to submit my thesis,’ she said. ‘I saved up a bit of money. I thought, I’ll just move to London, because that’s where the jobs are, and I’ll see what happens. I couldn’t find a professional job in my chosen field because I didn’t have my PhD yet.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/15/belle-de-jour-blogger-prostitute?"&gt;The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But now &lt;a href="http://www.123people.co.uk/s/brooke+magnanti"&gt;Magnanti&lt;/a&gt;, a respected specialist in developmental neurotoxicology and cancer epidemiology in a hospital research group in Bristol, has spoken of the time six years ago she worked as a £300 an hour prostitute working through a London escort agency. Magnanti turned to the agency in the final stages of her PhD thesis when she ran out of money. She was already an experienced science blogger and began writing about her experiences in a web diary later adapted into books and a television drama starring Billie Piper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ/status/5726410500"&gt;BoraZ of Science Blogs&lt;/a&gt; pondered what ‘experienced science blogger meant’ back in 2003 – evidence in her favour demonstrates the following ‘zine articles on &lt;a href="http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000048.shtml"&gt;autopsies&lt;/a&gt;, which I really enjoyed. The &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/www.babao.org.uk/BABAO2002Abstracts.doc"&gt;rest of her research&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.upsideclone.com/2002_04_12.php"&gt;even science fiction&lt;/a&gt;) you can &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23959226_Geographical_analysis_of_thyroid_cancer_in_young_people_from_northern_England_Evidence_for_a_sustained_excess_in_females_in_Cumbria"&gt;find fairly easily online&lt;/a&gt; (I’ve already ‘Twittered’ a few links):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000061.shtml"&gt;Barbelith&lt;/a&gt; – The Autopsy – spectacle or science? By &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooke Magnanti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…To what end is our modern habit of denying the brutality and carnality of life? What do we gain? Widespread animal cruelty in the name of convenient food, for one. Foreign policy that refuses to acknowledge and intervene in even the clearest cases of genocide. The increasing paternalism of those who, simply by having access to knowledge that should be free, erect a wall between the public and the NHS, military and the government. Groups created as servants of society are instead gatekeepers in a paradigm of information transfer where the only way to gain influence is to renounce idealism. Of all the medical students I’ve met, only one actually wanted to become a GP past her third year. The vast majority view that option as a poor second to the financial possibilities of specialisation and consultancy. Frankly, I’m surprised more of them don’t train in cosmetic dentistry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They present their results as empirical evidence of Red Queen dynamics in which coevolution with virulent parasites generates continued evolution.  Although Van Valen (1973) originally presented a macroevolutionary argument where by reciprocal selection of hosts and their parasites generates conditions for continuous change, Bell (1982) narrowed the focus as a mechanistic explanation for the evolution or maintenance of sexual reproduction through cyclical changes in genotype frequencies.  Wolinska and Spaak (2009) are not addressing the evolution of sex, but looking for evidence that parasites in Daphnia populations are generating negative frequency dependent selection such that a rare genotype has an advantage.  Evidence consistent with the Red Queen has been found in other systems using spatially distributed samples (e.g. Dybdahl and Lively 1995) to look non-random infection rates as well as more directly looking at changes in frequencies of common genotypes (e.g. Dybdahl and Lively 1998).Wolinska and Spaak (2009) propose three hypotheses to test with their data.  The first is that common genotypes should be either over or under infected compared to a random sample.  This prediction is based on stereotyped cyclical dynamics of genotypes of hosts and parasites (image two out of sync sine waves).  At some points, the common clones will be targeted by the parasites and become overly infected.  As a genotype becomes common, parasites haven&amp;#39;t started attacking this genotype yet (i.e. time lagged), so it is under infected.  In their survey, the found that indeed, some of the populations showed over infection (n = 1) and other showed under infection (n = 11), although the majority of cases did show no significant difference from random infection probabilities which is predicted as being a rare event.  Their second hypothesis was that common genotypes should over the course of time decline if they are being tracked by parasites.  The previous sample included only different lakes; where as the data needed to test this hypothesis are temporal samples from the same location.  Their additional data is consistent with common genotypes declining over time (9 out of 10 cases).  However, it is unclear to me how the general trend in this data of common genotypes decreasing over time, leads to the evidence supporting the first hypothesis.  Shouldn&amp;#39;t they find many more over infected common clones?  A third hypothesis that they tested regarded host-parasite interactions maintaining diversity and an evenness of genotype frequencies which their data supported.When discussing this paper, we were interested in what happens to predictions based on Red Queen dynamics when more than one parasite is involved.  Previous empirical papers and theory seems to be generally focused on a host and a common parasite, but we know hosts are attacked by all kinds of parasites and pathogens.  The system described by Wolinska and Spaak (2009) involves a host hybrid complex as well as four different parasites and questions about host specialization and hybrid maintenance were addressed in a previous paper (Wolinska et al. 2007).

On Monday, I told them they would be doing so this past Thursday. So they had 3 additional days to study. Tuesday and Wednesday the entire class was spent reviewing the test material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In specific, students were having trouble with collecting like terms, dealing with sets, closure, and counter examples, and solving for absolute values. Less so, a few students also still can't figure out that when adding decimals, you have to line up the decimal points. They were subtracting numbers from the tens columns from ones from the hundredths columns. In the two in class days we had, we did numerous examples of all of these.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet come test time, scores for these types of problems barely increased. I'd changed the problems slightly, altering numbers here and there, but the problems were more or less the same. Even with clearer wordings that students had said was confusing on the first test (although it shouldn't have been if they had bothered studying the first time around and knew the terms).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, the class average improved by 1.4%. Two students actually got &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; scores than they did the first time (one whined about not knowing there was a test even though he had been told both Monday and the class before when it was and then after the test told me he "wasn't in a test taking mood").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it stands, only one student has scored above a C. Two have scored C's. One is a D, and the remaining four are failing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I keep asking myself if this is a failure in my teaching, but I asked another one of the teachers that has the same grade level (the 10th graders) for Chemistry, and he told me that the students did so poorly on his first test (same week as mine) he too made them retake it. But even nicer than me, he gave them the &lt;i&gt;exact same test&lt;/i&gt; and they still failed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words cannot describe how stunned I am at the almost amazing inability to retain any knowledge of these students. Nor can I describe how stunned I am that they don't care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here, I think I'm going to have to split the class up: Those that are scoring a D or below will have to retake the test again and again until they can perform these prerequisite skills. The one with a C will need to make sure he refreshes those topics he missed. The A will be allowed to move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what a terrible burden to have to place on a teacher: To be maintaining two different classes in one.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5937200088114684546?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258239557823"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/dang_computer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30597358249f3564</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Dang #@$%&amp;amp; computer</title><published>2009-11-14T22:25:22Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T22:25:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/HjfpOUnBZv8/dang_computer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/dang_computer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; going to blog along with the talks today, but my note-taking computer, a little netpc, decided to turn up dead on arrival when I sat down to start listening — I had to take notes &lt;i&gt;on paper&lt;/i&gt;. It felt medieval. There were a bunch of good talks and I'll transcribe them later when I get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I just have a brief moment before I head off to the next event, so I'll leave you with a couple of Immensely Difficult Questions for Evolution that were just sent to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1. If humans evolved from monkeys, why are there not any other intelligent
beings that have evolved from other animals? Should we not see more
"intelligent beings" evolving from other species?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q2. After centuries, we have yet to reproduce any artificial system that
simulates the functioning of the brain. Is it possible for such an complex
organ to have evolved from simpler organisms? how could this have been
possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1 is just a trivial variant of the "if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys" nonsense. We haven't evolved more intelligent species because a) intelligence seems to be an unlikely destination for an evolving species, b) there is no particular reason any particular species ought to evolve intelligence rather than, say, a better immune system or adapt to a new diet or acquire more efficient camouflage, and c) any intelligent monkey-men will be either enslaved or slaughtered by the species currently occupying the intelligent-tool-user niche, i.e., us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2 is also just a variant of the &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s too complex to have evolved&amp;quot; argument. The human brain exists. We have evidence of predecessors with smaller brains. We can see that the brain forms by natural processes. We can see advantages to individuals in our lineage that are smarter. We can readily infer from the available evidence in anatomy, comparative biology, paleontology, molecular biology, and neuroscience that the simplest explanation, the one that requires the least invocation of mysterious, unidentified forces, is that the brain evolved. Anyone who wants to argue otherwise should provide concrete examples of other processes that could have played a role…and no, scientifically-inclined intelligent monkey-men who evolved 2 million years ago and used advanced biotechnological engineering to inflate the brains of their primitive tailless relatives is not a concrete example, unless you have real evidence of such creatures&amp;#39; existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and vaporous cosmic deities doing likewise don't count either, for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/dang_computer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/HjfpOUnBZv8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258237804952"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-303436877567405516">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a62397e509078aa8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">John Wesley and The Origins of the Natural Health Movement</title><published>2009-11-14T20:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T20:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/11/john-wesley-and-origins-of-natural.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Le Canard Noir</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258237751030"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18289">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78c3c26206bd5a1b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Pop Culture"/><title type="html">Vinyl Sagan</title><published>2009-11-14T22:00:46Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T22:00:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/14/vinyl-sagan/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you read science or atheist blogs, odds are you’ve seen the video of “A Glorious Dawn,” which featured remixed versions of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autotuned song was created by &lt;strong&gt;John Boswell&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Third Man Records is putting out a limited edition 7″ vinyl record &lt;a href="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/news.html"&gt;release of the song&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Third Man Records, in conjunction with United Record Pressing, fabricated a special “Cosmos Colored Vinyl” of which 150 copies will be available…50 randomly inserted into mail orders for “A Glorious Dawn” and the remainder to be made available at the Third Man Records Nashville store front at noon on November 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-sided single features a very special etching on the flipside. Reproduced from the original artwork, the etching copies the etching included with the Voyager Golden Record, set off into space in 1977 as the most elaborate message-in-a-bottle idea ever imagined. With its inclusion of Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was The Night” it goes without saying that the Voyager Golden Record is one of Third Man’s favorite releases of all-time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html"&gt;purchase it here&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s $6, including shipping, for Americans — a little more for the rest of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, is a Vinyl Sagan like a Velvet Elvis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be posting my notes on this as we go, but first of all, if you ever hear someone present the “asparagus cures cancer” crap to an individual whose family member was recently diagnosed with cancer, as recently happened to my girlfriend, please be so kind as to scream at them for being an ignorant moron causing more harm by encouraging someone to eat a substance WHICH COUNTERACTS ANTICANCER PHARMACEUTICALS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I had a man seeking asparagus for a friend who had cancer.   He gave me a photocopied copy of an article, entitled, `Asparagus for cancer’ printed in Cancer News Journal, December 1979. I will share it here, just as it was shared with me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what kind of crap this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a biochemist, and have specialized in the relation of diet to health for over 50 years. Several years ago, I learned of the discovery of Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. that asparagus might cure cancer. Since then, I have worked with him on his project, and we have accumulated a number of favorable case histories. Here are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first note is the name: Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. This title would be a Doctor of Dental Surgery rather than a biochemist. We also do not get the name of the individual writing this letter.  Doing a web search for “Richard R. Vensal” only turns up pages relating to this particular story. If you’d like to know what’s actually in “Cancer News Journal” on December 1979. This is NOT a scientific cancer journal, but an alternative TO medicine journal. Anyway, I found no mention of this article on their website, nor any mention of any other article on any other website. Even as far as altie quacks go, this one is pretty obscure if it even exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case No. 1, man with an almost hopeless case of Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymph glands) who was completely incapacitated. Within 1 year of starting the asparagus therapy, his doctors were unable to detect any signs of cancer, and he was back on a schedule of strenuous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the doctors were unable to detect any sign of cancer, then how does this person know it was Hodgkin’s disease? We knew the pathology of Hodgkin’s lymphoma since the 1830’s. People were being diagnosed with this disease three years before they would die from it as early as 1950! They knew what the disease looked like and how to check for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case No. 2, a successful businessman 68 years old who suffered from cancer of the bladder for 16 years. After years of medical treatments, including radiation without improvement, he went on asparagus. Within 3 months, examinations revealed that his bladder tumor had disappeared and that his kidneys were normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there is absolutely no reason to consider this true, due to the lack of references, unreliability of the “journal,” and apparent nonexistence of the author. In any event, making the mistake of considering radiation therapy as performed in the 1970s to be anywhere near what is done over three decades is committing an act of intellectual high treason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case No. 3, a man who had lung cancer. On March 5th 1971 he was put on the operating table where they found lung cancer so widely spread that it was inoperable. The surgeon sewed him up and declared his case hopeless. On April 5th he heard about the asparagus therapy and immediately started taking it. By August, x-ray pictures revealed that all signs of the cancer had disappeared. He is back at his regular business routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing, also, how the first therapies and surgeries for lung cancers (there are multiple types of lung cancer) weren’t done UNTIL the 1970s. There is no reason to expect success in this surgery, but a physician would at least attempt removing SOME of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case No. 4, a woman who was troubled for a number of years with skin cancer. She finally developed different skin cancers which were diagnosed by a skin specialist as advanced. Within 3 months after starting on asparagus, her skin specialist said that her skin looked fine and no more skin lesions. This woman reported that the asparagus therapy also cured her kidney disease   which started in 1949. She had over 10 operations for kidney stones, and was receiving government disability payments for an inoperable, terminal, kidney condition. She attributes the cure of this kidney trouble entirely to the asparagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that with all the people that eat asparagus and have skin cancer, (just by statistical coincidence) there would be at least some documentation of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not surprised at this result, as `The elements of materia medica’, edited in 1854 by a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, stated that asparagus was used as a popular remedy for kidney stones. He even referred to experiments, in 1739, on the power of asparagus in dissolving stones. We would have other case histories but the medical establishment has interfered with our obtaining some of the records. I am therefore appealing to readers to spread this good news and help us to gather a large number of case histories that will overwhelm the medical skeptics about this unbelievably simple and natural remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, look, a book; the book has no mention of experiments. It instead refers to another, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4UsUAAAAQAAJ"&gt;less known volume&lt;/a&gt; by Theophilus Lobb. Want to &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/elementsofmateri01pereuoft"&gt;see for yourself&lt;/a&gt;? It would be a bit better if it was a bit more specific, you know, what VOLUME in that huge ass reference book that citation was in? The research involved putting the kidney stones INTO asparagus juice, not drinking asparagus juice and dissolving kidney stones &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the treatment, asparagus should be cooked before using, and therefore canned asparagus is just as good as fresh. I have corresponded with the two leading canners of asparagus, Giant Giant and Stokely, and I am satisfied that these brands contain no pesticides or preservatives. Place the cooked asparagus in a blender and liquefy to make a puree, and store in the refrigerator. Give the patient 4 full tablespoons twice daily, morning and evening. Patients usually show some improvement in from 2-4 weeks. It can be diluted with water and used as a cold or hot drink. This suggested dosage is based on present experience, but certainly larger amounts can do no harm and may be needed in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What chemical, exactly, is supposed to do something to CANCER? How does it work? No mechanism of action=not from a biochemist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a biochemist I am convinced of the old saying that `what cures can prevent’. Based on this theory, my wife and I have been using asparagus puree as a beverage with our meals. We take 2 tablespoons diluted in water to suit our taste with breakfast and with dinner. I take mine hot and my wife prefers hers cold. For years we have made it a practice to have blood surveys taken as part of our regular checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biochemist? Wouldn’t this be “dentist?” I’d also expect this to at least be reported by a reputable journal, or even a crank journal, a bit more often. I don’t think I have to explain the fallacy of “what cures can prevent.” Think about antibiotics and MRSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last blood survey, taken by a medical doctor who specializes in the nutritional approach to health, showed substantial improvements in all categories over the last one, and we can attribute these improvements to nothing but the asparagus drink. As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nutritional approach to health”=probably a quack. How can normal levels “improve?” This is complete nonsense. The individual here proposes no biochemical mechanism of action. Even if this was written in 1979, the volume of scientific literature on cancer was SO mountainous, no one individual could ever hope to read all of it. I strongly doubt he understood genetic mechanisms and biochemical signaling for angiogenesis. This really seems to be quite a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance. The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good.” It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body’s most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the part that REALLY makes this seem like a hoax. ALL cellular material contains a large supply of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"&gt;histones&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of glutathione is way overrated. It is an antioxidant, but it reduces the efficacy of &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109593581/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;anticancer drugs due to its reactivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You know that I do.  That's why I answer your emails.  Still, some of you are making me lose my fucking mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman_pulling_out_hair.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/woman_pulling_out_hair.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="218" width="283"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/pulling%20hair%20out%20woman/micatiipak/Blog%20Pics/woman_pulling_out_hair.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: An artist's rendition of Dr. Isis answering some of your emails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I love you, but some of you are making me crazy.  I realize the finer points of the pseudonymous blogosphere are easy to miss, but some events over the last few weeks have led me to create a list of things to remember when you are emailing me. As soon as I figure out how to HTML this bitch, I'll put it up at the top of the blog, but for now...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I assume that anything you send me is fair game for use on my blog&lt;/b&gt;.  Unless you specifically tell me otherwise, but you should still see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/contact.php"&gt;my general policy&lt;/a&gt; regarding email. Dr. Isis is a benevolent blogger and generally operates with her muffins' best interests in mind, but sometimes she still &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23FWDAOTI#search?q=%23FWDAOTI"&gt;#FWDAOTI&lt;/a&gt; for the greater good of the blogosphere.  She can&amp;#39;t help herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have no idea whether you want to be pseudonymous or not if you don't tell me.&lt;/b&gt;  If you email me from an email address that uses your real name, and you sign the email with your real name, then I can only assume that it is okay to address you by your real name.  I&amp;#39;m not a mind reader.  Sign the email the way you wish to be addressed.  My &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2008/11/a_statement_from_dr_isis.php"&gt;policy on your pseudonym&lt;/a&gt; is here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If one of the parties in your email is a reader of my blog, do not out them to me. &lt;/b&gt; I don&amp;#39;t want to know that JBrown6969 is your graduate student or BioBrain is your department chair.  PLEASE don&amp;#39;t tell me their real name. It&amp;#39;s not relevant to the answering of your question and it&amp;#39;s a move of extreme asshattery to out another blogger.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The internet is forever.&lt;/b&gt;  Once I publish your question, it&amp;#39;s out there forever.  I can edit your letter locally on the ScienceBlogs site, but my blog is syndicated to RSS feeds, websites that steal blog content, your mom&amp;#39;s house, and there is no way I can get every version back.  I can&amp;#39;t guarantee that the original version won&amp;#39;t be read by the person you didn&amp;#39;t want reading it.  So, think very carefully before you hit &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; because I am going to assume that you thought out the content of your email.  For some guidance on things to consider when you craft the content of an email, check out my personal &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/05/isis_the_scientists_rules_for.php"&gt;Rules for Pseudonymous Blogging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't out your students&lt;/b&gt;.  Teaching is hard.  Really hard.  One of the most common things people write me about is how to deal with particular student issues.  But, you&amp;#39;ll notice if you read my site, I don&amp;#39;t frequently answer these questions on my blog.  The reason is that many of the letters contain a level of detail that I am not comfortable publishing.  One of the important things about teaching is creating an environment in which students feel relatively safe making a mistake and learning from it - that includes not publishing their mistake on the interwebz.  So, if you can phrase your letter in a way that does not lead to the identification of your student, I&amp;#39;ll answer it.  Otherwise, you&amp;#39;re just plain out of luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

English has somewhere around 44 phonemes (experts differ, especially in regards to dialects). Most native speakers can produce and understand ten to fifteen phonemes per
second in a normal speech rhythm, and up to thirty phonemes per second at a rapid rate.  Phonemes aren&amp;#39;t produced in isolation, but blend together into melody of spoken language. Written language represents phonemes by one or more graphemes (individual letters).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis about reading difficulty is that struggling readers, at a fundamental level, don&amp;#39;t respond to spoken language the same way that competent readers do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do children who learn to read easily process spoken language in a different way than children who struggle to learn to read?  A new study on the relative auditory skills of children with and without a reading disability  seems to suggest so.  (&lt;em&gt;Caveat -- I haven&amp;#39;t read the full study (&lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273%2809%2900807-1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) as it is behind a paywall.  Northwestern University press release &lt;a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/11/dyslexia.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mo, who blogs at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/"&gt;Neurophilosophy&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2009/11/dyslexia_cocktail_party_effect.php"&gt;good description of the study&lt;/a&gt;, and concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier behavioural studies suggested that a core deficit of developmental dyslexia is the inability to exclude background noise from the incoming stream of auditory information. The new work confirms this, and shows that the inability arises because neurons in the auditory brainstem do not fine-tune their responses to speech cues. As a result, dyslexic children apparently cannot filter out background noise, and so have difficulty paying attention in the noisy classroom environment. The new findings suggest that they would benefit from sitting at the front of the room or wearing noise-reducing headphones to help them concentrate, and may provide a new way of diagnosing the condition. The researchers are also investigating the possibility that &lt;a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/45/14100?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=nina+kraus&amp;amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;musical training&lt;/a&gt; might improve speech-in-noise perception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	


I also wonder if direct, intensive, and explicit training in recognizing and manipulating the sounds of spoken language may prove helpful.  This is commonly called &amp;quot;phonemic awareness.&amp;quot;  An excellent introductory article is Phonemic Awareness in Young Children By Marilyn J. Adams, Barbara Foorman, Ingvar Lundberg, and Terri Beeler (1998) (&lt;a href="http://www.readingrockets.org/article/408"&gt;http://www.readingrockets.org/article/408&lt;/a&gt;).  The University of Oregon has a curriculum map for kindergarten and first grade phonemic awareness (&lt;a href="http://reading.uoregon.edu/big_ideas/pa/pa_sequence.php"&gt;http://reading.uoregon.edu/big_ideas/pa/pa_sequence.php&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the musical training reference:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Auditory Neuroscience Lab has been a frontrunner in research
that has helped establish the relationship between sound encoding in
the brainstem, and how this process is affected by an individual&amp;#39;s
experience throughout the lifespan. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090713201442.htm"&gt;In related research with
significant implications, recent studies from the Kraus lab show that
the process of hearing speech in noise is enhanced in musicians.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The very transcription processes that are deficient in poor readers
are enhanced in people with musical experience,&amp;quot; Kraus said. &amp;quot;It makes
sense for training programs for poor readers to involve music as well
as speech sounds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have absolutely no idea what to do with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those that don't know what it is, it seems to be a mix between an instant messenger, Email, and a Wiki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's an IM service in that you can talk real time. It's Email similar to how Gmail works in that it keeps things as a thread and all posts in a topic are connected. And it's a Wiki in such that anyone can edit &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; in the thread, including something someone else has written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's supposed to be used as a tool for collaboration and I can see how it could be pretty nifty. If I were still a student doing research, I think this would be a great way to bring together a research project. But alas, I'm not and I can't really see a good way for this to be put into use for me. &lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/zVn91.jpg"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; sums up how I feel about the Wave right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone else hereabouts have it or have any thoughts?&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-2240106428125243719?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258233432955"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10505">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6862cbde6904992</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anti-Science"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">2012: THE GREATEST REVIEW YOU’LL EVER READ</title><published>2009-11-14T21:00:54Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T21:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/11/2012-the-greatest-review-youll-ever-read/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bam! Boom! Explosion! Building falling down on your head!  VOLCANO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you like that introduction to this blog entry? If so, then you’ll love &lt;em&gt;2012&lt;/em&gt;, starring John Cusack, Danny Glover, and your nutty aunt who sends you all those email forwards about how the cure for cancer was discovered by the Inuit in the 1800s but eaten by a whale that was brainwashed and programmed by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: I went into this knowing what I was getting. I didn’t care about plot or dialogue, and in fact I hoped that it would be as insipid as possible to not distract from the billions of people being murdered in a spectacular fashion. &lt;em&gt;2012&lt;/em&gt; is disaster porn, and I loved it. I got to see a bunch of buildings blow up, even more than past efforts like &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. Hell, they even destroy the Vatican. The Vatican!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, if you’re a twisted fuck with low expectations like me, you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some skeptics and scientists may scoff, so here’s a review for all of you rational folks who are wondering if this is for you. If you’ve never seen a movie like this before, then mild spoilers follow.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayan Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 “Mayan Prophesy” bullshit* is in there, but it’s pretty lost amidst the eruption of the super-volcano beneath Yellowstone National Park. So it’s mostly like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: The Earth is freaking the eff out man! We’re all gonna die!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: You know, the Mayans and the Inuit and the, I dunno, some other religions and cultures totally predicted this or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: Uh-huh that’s interesting LOOK OUT A VOLCANO JUST HAPPENED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: AAAAAAH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: AAAAAAAAAAAH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspiracy Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody Harrelson plays a crazy Alex Jones/George Noory-type radio personality who lives in a camper in Yellowstone, where he does his show while eating pickles and probably jacking off to Bigfoot porn. Seriously, he’s crazy. He might be right, but he’s not the kind of person you (or conspiracy theorists) would possibly want to identify with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s this whole subplot where OKAY KIND OF A BIG SPOILER ALERT SO SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH MAYBE the US government spends three years knocking off anybody who threatens to spill the beans about our incoming doom because they don’t want people freaking the eff out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OKAY YOU CAN START READING AGAIN But come on, that is so completely ridiculous that if anyone tries using this movie to develop or support his boneheaded conspiracy theory beliefs, anyone who happened to see the movie would immediately laugh in his face and then call the cops to take him away to the funny factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chauvinist Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what men do in this movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rescue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comfort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make up for being shitty fathers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;die heroically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what women do in this movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get rescued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;birth babies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;die tragically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racist Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay actually it’s not racist but I noticed something and wanted to put it out there. In this movie, all black people are related, or will be eventually. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pseudoscience Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, basically there is nothing scientific about this movie and I’m sure &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; will break it down for you later, but basically everything is caused by MINOR SPOILER ALERT the sun? And solar flares? Sending neutrons through the Earth’s core, and this has totally never happened before but suddenly the neutrons are interacting with the matter? And making the Earth’s core heat up? Also at one point the entire crust of the Earth shifts by over 1,000 miles, which was SPOILER ALERT very handy because the characters were all like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: Oh no we’ll never get there in time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: But that would be horrible because then we’ll all die in a truly terrib…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: Never mind, we’re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: But I thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: Crust moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 1: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAN 2: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Unbelievable Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPOILER ALERT SO MAYBE SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH So the entire population of the Earth is about to die, and only the really rich people and world leaders get tickets to safety. The Italian Prime Minister decides not to be rescued and instead “rely upon prayer.” Cut to the Prime Minister at the Vatican with a big crowd of people getting blessed by the Pope. This is the single most unbelievable thing in the movie, because you god damn know that with billions of dollars and a major ego problem, the head of the Catholic Church is sure as fuck not going to stick around to see the end of the world. He’s going to be praising science and stepping on the heads of AIDS babies to get to safety. Don’t believe me? Prove me wrong, Pope. Prove me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there you go. Weigh all of that against the prospect of seeing some pretty awesome special effects showing billions of people die. For me, it’s an easy decision. I LOVE seeing CGI people bite it, so I really enjoyed it. During the lulls between death sequences, I busied myself by predicting what city would be destroyed next, and how, so it didn’t even bother me during those boring bits where people call each other on the phone and sob about how much they love each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you see it? Are you going to see it? Give your thoughts in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Note to new readers: the world will not end in 2012 and the Mayans didn’t think so, either. The “end” of the Mayan calendar is like the end of your calendar. Go buy a new one and you’re fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258233312464"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/canadian_magicians_will_write.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7cf8db8df6d84ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Canadian Magicians Will Write Prescriptions</title><published>2009-11-14T20:16:34Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T20:16:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/tQSRsfRRMrE/canadian_magicians_will_write.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/canadian_magicians_will_write.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;The other day, I went to a magic show.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Isis, I am writing you because after reading your blog for almost a year now, I see you have impeccable taste and wonderful advice! Let me get to the point because I know you have a busy life: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I and another graduate student in my lab have been working on an abstract submission for a REGIONAL conference over the past month. The deadline is tomorrow. Our PI has known about our abstract for this entire month. She put off reading our draft until JUST this past Wednesday when she was at a meeting OVERSEAS.. and she is still there. Now, of course, she is fretting about our sample size and bringing up issues that she should have noticed a while ago. She is also now ignoring our emails despite the deadline in 24 hours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have collected, analyzed, lit-reviewed, and written this entire project. It just happened to be in HER lab. We are not trying to publish a paper in Nature or anything--it's just a poster presentation at a regional conference that we want to go to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it totally unacceptable to email her ass over in foreign country and tell her that we are submitting it whether or not we hear from her? We have nothing to lose, in our opinions. The worst that can happen is it gets rejected. I feel really bad especially for my partner in this--as she is a full time student with an  internship at a fancy hospital and research position on TOP OF 2 TODDLERS. She&amp;#39;s spent so much time on this and is really upset, as am I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Help!! The deadline is in 1 day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~One of your many loyal readers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, dearest little muffin.  Dearest, most darling little muffin.  If I could reach out and give you a hug and a cupcake, I totally would.  Especially since you are not going to like what I have to say to you.  Still, I am going to be as kind as I possibly can be....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font style="font-size:1.25em"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do it!   For the love of God, don&amp;#39;t do it!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Back away from the submit button carefully and slowly and no one will get hurt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt="doomsday_hub_desk.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/doomsday_hub_desk.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="331" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/additional/large/doomsday_hub_desk.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: Noooooooo!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Beyond anything else I am about to tell you, it is inappropriate to submit anything anywhere with an author listed who did not agree to have the item submitted.  Completely inappropriate.  In that sense, your question reads like a textbook question from an ethics and science class.  If you are ready to submit that abstract with authors that read...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One L. Reader, Partner I. Crime, and Absent P. Investigator&lt;br&gt;Department of Totally Hot Science, Major Research University&lt;br&gt;Middle of Nowhere Town, One of the 50 States, USA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and AP Investigator did not approve, then &lt;u&gt;just don't do it&lt;/u&gt;.  Enough said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so many things in your email that I want to address because I can tell how emotionally invested in this project you are.  I know nothing about your relationship with your advisor.  She could the most supportive mentor ever or she could be a complete lunatic.  Because you&amp;#39;ve told me nothing about your relationship, I am going to operate from the position that she has an interest in seeing you succeed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With those assumptions in mind, let's more carefully address some of the major issues....&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/ask_dr_isis_-_do_i_submit_an_a.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/ask_dr_isis_-_do_i_submit_an_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/5OQ0kU5hkzU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258228434121"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/weekend_diversion_some_amazing.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72c7f40fe5b42600</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Some Amazing Science on TV!</title><published>2009-11-14T19:40:16Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T19:40:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/weekend_diversion_some_amazing.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But I want you to know something... you and me, it's not gonna be a one-way street. 'Cause I don't believe in one-way streets. Not between people, and not while I'm driving.  So, here's some advice I wish I woulda got when I was your age: Live every week like it's Shark Week. &lt;i&gt;-Tracy Jordan, &lt;u&gt;30 Rock&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, much like Tracy, the song for you this week is simple, sweet, and good-hearted.  Enjoy an old classic, &lt;a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/bandits/justthetwoofus.htm"&gt;Just the Two of Us&lt;/a&gt; by Grover Washington, Jr., and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/weekend_diversion_one_weekend.php"&gt;Bill Withers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/weekend_diversion_some_amazing/73%2520Just%2520The%2520Two%2520Of%2520Us%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have asked about whether there were any good science programs on television, and I have found one for you.  Starting tomorrow night, it isn't Shark Week (sorry, Tracy).  It's National Geographic's &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/"&gt;2nd Annual Expedition Week&lt;/a&gt;.  I've gotten an advance copy, and these are really interesting investigations into all sorts of natural and human phenomena.  And yes, there's a great episode (with a lot of science) about &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4906/Overview"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; (Image Credit: © Chris Ross/Chris Fischer).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/weekend_diversion_some_amazing/4015370214_94a12be6f3.jpg" width="500" alt="4015370214_94a12be6f3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also an episode about &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4588/Overview"&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/a&gt;, which is balanced and scientifically accurate, plus it has Robert Zubrin, whom I met back in 1999 and really respect his views on Mars exploration and colonization.

&lt;p&gt;But the other episodes I've seen so far -- about the &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4380/Overview"&gt;Amazonian Head-Shrinkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/expedition-week/4290/Overview"&gt;the First Jesus&lt;/a&gt; -- have been fascinating, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment of these subjects is entirely different from what I've come to expect from, say, the History Channel.  The expeditions are riveting because the questions they're asking are riveting, and you get to journey along with the researchers, watching some of the science unfold as it unfolds.  It gives me a tremendous appreciation for the level of specialization of knowledge in our society, as well as providing an accurate picture of scientific investigation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's something that's very rare on television these days, and I've found this to be an excellent program.  So if you can watch it, enjoy it, and have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/weekend_diversion_some_amazing.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258227875049"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/honey_badger_vs_cobra_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e3786611928ad47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Honey Badger vs. Cobra</title><published>2009-11-14T19:42:29Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T19:42:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/WBAqvuinvKM/honey_badger_vs_cobra_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/honey_badger_vs_cobra_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ua3M1O-WQrM%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/honey_badger_vs_cobra_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/WBAqvuinvKM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258227875047"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/what_linux_distro_and_version.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53b8c0385e4ab3b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="one-liners"/><title type="html">What Linux Distro and Version am I using????</title><published>2009-11-14T18:45:51Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T18:45:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/64zHBB7e6hc/what_linux_distro_and_version.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/what_linux_distro_and_version.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the old days, you could just use the "help" menu item to figure this out (drilling down to "about") but now there is so much "helpful" crap in the dialog that opens when you do so, that it has become much less helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we knew it had to happen. It wasn’t a matter of where, only when. Get your flashlights out ghosthunters! We are about to embark on an new era of supernatural fiction the likes of which have never been seen or heard of  in any other civilized country. Watch as the glimmer of skepticism that was once a bright new concept in television gets buried under an avalanche of dung masquerading as entertainment. Ahhhhhhhh. Only in America…&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And will we be treted to a Fox-news style “paranormal news” section hosted by Dan Ackroyd? You think I’m kidding don’t you? Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Up-Date”  has just leapt off the back burners of history and will soon be cooking up a whole new genre of glassy- eyed fandom. Only this time it isn’t comedy. I may be wrong here but I’m guessing this 24-7 deal isn’t going to feature re-runs of &lt;em&gt;“The Nightstalker”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“Twilight Zone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I’m thinking all the paranormal crap that has been clogging the airwaves for the past ten years will now have a permanent home where it can fester and congeal into the minds of the next generation of cult wooists, unchallenged by anything even approaching critical thinking. The owners or creators of this abomination can take pride in the fact that they will be responsible for the further dumbing down of American culture. I’m sure they don’t care about that though. They will rake in millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances they would include a program of skeptical thinking? None. America has spoken. We are in for a rough ride. As if what we Skeptologists have been pitching for the last year wasn’t hard enough, I’m pretty sure there won’t be a shred of “reality” to this entire venture. I can’t wait for the advertisers too. The woo merchants are going to have a field day with this network. Look at the website and you will clearly see that the Coffey’s, Brownes, Moon’s and all the rest of the shady characters who have been waiting for this moment to spread their webby wings will now be enthroned as the new “people to watch.”  PTN are already trolling for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“BROADCAST YOUR LIVE EVENT, SHOW, OR INVESTIGATION” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then, Can you hardly wait for this one:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img title="hauntedhill" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/hauntedhill1.jpg" alt="hauntedhill" width="308" height="188"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;Boy Howdy! &lt;em&gt;“Green Acres”&lt;/em&gt; Meets &lt;em&gt;“The X-Files”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;Ahhhhhhrrrrrrggggghhhhhh!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about this charmer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="ccbanner_188" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/ccbanner_188.jpg" alt="ccbanner_188" width="247" height="188"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;CC looks like she’s seen a lot of, …eh, well, ….&lt;em&gt;hunting? &lt;/em&gt;That  might be the kindest word I can think of at this point. And there’s so much more to look forward to (or is it backward to) there on the website: &lt;a href="http://www.theparanormaltelevisionnetwork.com"&gt;www.theparanormaltelevisionnetwork.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer length of their URL should dissuade at least a few knuckle-draggers from getting to the site. Maybe this whole charade will turn out for the best. We can only hope that this unrelenting dearth of woo will become so big it will choke itself to death like some science fiction monster fighting to gain complete control of the earth. Remember what happened to &lt;em&gt;“The Psychic Friends Network?”&lt;/em&gt;  And I should know. They still owe me money.That wasn’t so long ago. Might this monumental hoax become a parody of itself? Will people begin to refer to anything stupid by eventually saying, “…You belong on PTN dude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we dare to hope for a pendulum or better yet  …a wrecking ball?&lt;/p&gt;

The authors found increased transcript levels of at least 9 enzymes within the cholesterol synthesis pathway that was confirmed with real time PCR.      Upregulation of theses genes was caused by a prion-dependent increase in the activity and amount of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp2), which caused elevated levels of free and total cholesterol.  Srebp2 also regulates the expression of low density lipoprotein receptors, which is the main receptor for acquiring extracellular cholesterol.     Moreover, downregulation of Srebp2 using siRNA in the absence of exogenous cholesterol decreased prion protein formation compared to cells without siRNA.  When external cholesterol was addeded, prion protein levels remained unchanged between cells with and without siRNA.  The activation of these genes was specific to neurons, as it was not observed in supportive cells including microglia and astrocytes.    These results suggest that prion propagation is associated with cholesterol and that neuronal cells respond to prion infection by upregulating genes involved in cholesterol synthesis.  This raises the possibility of using cholesterol modification for treatment purposes, however, this is complicated by the fact that most brain cholesterol is synthesized locally as plasma lipoproteins are restricted from crossing the blood/brain barrier.    Bach C, Gilch S, Rost R, Greenwood AD, Horsch M, Hajj GN, Brodesser S, Facius A, Schädler S, Sandhoff K, Beckers J, Leib-Mösch C, Schätzl HM, &amp;amp; Vorberg I (2009).

What can I say, I am a connoisseur of the weird.  As I’ve learned a little bit about Comfort’s ministry, I have been beginning to wonder – is this whole “Darwin giveaway” thing actually going to happen?  Or is it mostly imaginary – primarily a fundraising stunt?  I have seen lots of evidence that Comfort et al. are good at publicity and producing videos – but no evidence that they are strong on the ground.  If they were actually organized to distribute hundreds of thousands of books on hundreds of campuses, I kind of think there would be more evidence of that organization.  But there is virtually no such evidence, despite there being plenty of fundamentalist student groups on campuses that might serve as the foot soldiers for this sort of thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest odd thing along these lines – &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRESS RELEASE - 5 of 7 - Militant Atheists Seek Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militant Atheists Seek Details of Darwin Book Giveaway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 170,000 copies of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species with Ray Comfort’s Introduction are given away at universities around the country, atheists plan to be waiting for them. But they don’t know the identity of the universities the books will be given out. Comfort said. “The reason atheists are finding nothing is because every school that is being visited is a closely guarded secret. We don’t want to cause a disturbance. We simply want to get books into the hands of students across the country.” Others advised those who see the books being handed out said, “Cut out the intro in front of them, leave it on the table and take the book.” Another said, “Get them to sign [the] book, thank them, and then make some devastating point that will shatter them forever.” See &lt;a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/origin" rel="external "&gt;http://www.livingwaters.com/origin&lt;/a&gt; “Press kit” for textual, audio, and video sound bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?  The list of schools being visited is a closely-guarded secret?  Then why what it on their website at one point (if I recall correctly – &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/ray_comfort_replies_to_eugenie.php#comment-2043608" rel="external "&gt;here’s a copy from September&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="http://www.wikio.com/video/1693389" rel="external "&gt;why did they proudly announce in the original video&lt;/a&gt; that the top 50 American universities would be targeted?  In that video, they also said they were working with Campus Crusade, Answers in Genesis, and the Alliance Defense Fund – but I haven’t heard anything about the Origin-into-schools project from those groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it doesn’t make much sense and I don’t have any firsthand information, but at the moment I’m wondering if this Origin-into-schools thing will poke above the background noise of random crazies who hand out stuff on the quads of college campuses every day. (You can be sure, though, that there will be one place with Ray Comfort and his camera crew, since in some arenas, a video is worth more than 1,000,000 words and 1,000 on-the-ground volunteers.)&lt;/p&gt;

OMG have I ever been there before . But not on Mars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Martian rover Spirit got stuck in the dust on April 23rd of this year.  One wheel was already broken, forcing the little martian rover to drive backwards.  Then, its other wheels plunged through a crust covering the dusty infill of a 26 foot wide crater.  If Spirit turns into the crater, it's curtains.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, from April 23rd to now, NASA engineers have been thinking about this, modeling the situation, and experimenting with one of Spirit's Earth-based doppelgangers.  And now they feel ready to do their best to extricate Spirit from the dust.  Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a press release with all the details: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/there_is_not_much_hope_to_free.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/there_is_not_much_hope_to_free.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/AxOHsNl2azE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258223575976"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=4320">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4288a643d1282a30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">On Bloggingheads With Michael Specter</title><published>2009-11-14T17:17:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T17:17:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/14/on-bloggingheads-with-michael-specter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Building on our previous &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2234719/entry/2234720/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; discussion&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve now done a &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/23859?in=00:00&amp;amp;out=50:48"&gt;diavlog&lt;/a&gt; with the author of &lt;em&gt;Denialism&lt;/em&gt;; I’m embedding it below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cover a lot of ground–why Americans are weird with respect to science; why Specter’s book focuses on less known cases of denialism than the standard evolution/global warming stuff; and we got in depth into issues like Vioxx, genetically modified foods, personalized medicine, synthetic biology, alternative medicine, and much more. So I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m aware that colleagues whom I respect, like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/09/01/bloggingheads-and-the-old-challenges-of-new-tools/"&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/31/bye-to-bloggingheads/"&gt;Sean Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, have a serious issue with Bloggingheads over two diavlogs in the past that featured creationists, and have decided they no longer want to participate. After that happened, I weighed their concerns, as well as the defenses offered by Robert Wright and others. I was torn, as I communicated to Carl and Sean. It was easy for me to see that mistakes were made at Bloggingheads, but not so easy for me to agree that this had to mean no longer participating in such a valuable venue for high level intellectual discussion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I respect what Carl and Sean (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/09/04/bloggingheads-capo-non-grata/"&gt;and Phil&lt;/a&gt;!) think, I ultimately decided that I feel differently. Certainly, we should watch critically as Bloggingheads evolves. But the admission that mistakes were made, combined with the considerable reserve of goodwill that I bear towards the site for the innovation that it is and the many great dialogues it has fostered, were ultimately enough to make we want to keep participating, at least for the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the introductions to the sessions on the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Program/" title=""&gt;Program&lt;/a&gt;, here is what will happen on Saturday, January 16th at 10:15 - 11:20am:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Demos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;FieldTripEarth - &lt;a href="http://www.fieldtripearth.org/article_search.xml?author_id=2" title=""&gt;Mark MacAllister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://russlings.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Russ Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;a href="http://www.fieldtripearth.org/" title=""&gt;Field Trip Earth&lt;/a&gt; (FTE) is the conservation education website operated by the North Carolina Zoological Society. FTE works closely with field-based wildlife researchers and provides their "raw materials"--field journals, photos, datasets, GIS maps, and so on--to K-12 teachers and students. The website is in use by classrooms in all 50 US states and 140 countries world-wide, and was recently designated as a "Landmark Website" by the American Association of School Librarians. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/FieldTripEarth/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;NESCent - &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Craig McClain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nescent.org/dir/staff.php" title=""&gt;Robin Ann Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: "NESCent":http://www.nescent.org/index.php, online efforts. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/NESCent/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Research Triangle Park - &lt;a href="http://www.rtp.org/main/index.php?pid=194&amp;amp;sec=1" title=""&gt;Cara Rousseau and Tina Valdecanas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: "Research Triangle Park":http://www.rtp.org/main/ - how online and offline work together. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;PRI/BBC World-Science - &lt;a href="http://www.elsakristen.com/" title=""&gt;Elsa Youngsteadt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/" title=""&gt;Rhitu Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/" title=""&gt;PRI/BBC World-Science&lt;/a&gt; - combining radio, podcasts, the website and forums. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/PRIBBC_World-Science/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;B.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science on Radio, TV and video - &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecheerleader.com/" title=""&gt;Darlene Cavalier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kirstensanford.com/" title=""&gt;Kirsten 'Dr.Kiki' Sanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: How is science portrayed in mass market multi-media? We will examine the ways that the many available audio and video formats present scientific ideas, and the pros, and the cons to what reaches your eyes and ears. We will also embark on a conversation to investigate what can be done by the average scientist to help make science in the media even better. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Science_on_Radio_TV_and_video/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science in the cloud - &lt;a href="http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/hogeneschlab/" title=""&gt;John Hogenesch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: A series of parallel revolutions are occurring in science as data, analysis, ideas, and even scientific manuscript authoring are moving away from the desktop and into the cloud.  In this session we will focus on science and the cloud starting with the concept of Open Access, moving to cloud-based computation and its use cases, and how new efforts are bringing cloud approaches to the entire authorship and review process. Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Science_in_the_cloud/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rebooting Science Journalism in the Age of the Web - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/" title=""&gt;John Timmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/"&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Description: Our panel of journalist-blogger hybrids - Carl Zimmer, John Timmer,  Ed &lt;strike&gt;Yimmer&lt;/strike&gt; Yong, and David Dobbs- will discuss and debate the future of science journalism in the online world. Are blogs and mainstream media the bitter rivals that stereotypes would have us believe, or do the two sides have common threads and complementary strengths? How will the tools of the Internet change the art of reporting? How will the ongoing changes strengthen writing about science? How might these changes compromise or threaten writing about science? In a world where it's possible for anyone to write about science, where does that leave professional science journalists? And who actually are these science journalists anyway? Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Rebooting_Science_Journalism/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Privacy, ethics, and disasters: how being online as a doctor changes everything - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;Pal MD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/" title=""&gt;Val Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: We all know that there are potential pitfalls to having a prominent online presence, but for physicians, the implications affect more than just themselves.  How should doctors and similar professionals manage their online life?  What are the ethical and legal implications? Discuss &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Privacy_ethics_and_disasters/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/scienceonline2010_-_program_hi_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ZtS4rSL4Vh4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258221185278"><id gr:original-id="http://brainblogger.com/2009/11/14/cancer-to-screen-or-not-to-screen/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad7de704fe039ea0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Cancer – To Screen or Not to Screen?</title><published>2009-11-14T11:02:08Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T11:02:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/yNmPiJsiNo0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/11/14/cancer-to-screen-or-not-to-screen/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I once treated a patient who was in her 90s.

She’s about to turn a very special age: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;66.6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s cause for a celebration, right? &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   She thinks so, and she’s humorously making the best of it, using it as a fundraiser for a &lt;a href="http://www.atheistsunited.org/"&gt;favorite cause&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We will further tempt the beast by asking each adult to contribute $16.66, $6.66 for kids. This will go to the Atheists United general fund. If you’d like to bring a personal gift, please express that desire with an additional contribution to Atheists United.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Parra&lt;/strong&gt; of Atheists United suggests that everyone can do this — Figure out your “Beast Day” and use it to raise money for your favorite cause!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The easiest way to do it is to go [&lt;a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;] and enter your birthday, followed by 66 in the years and 219 days. (Some advanced mathematics — 0.6 times 365 days is 219 days).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Beast Day is Saturday, October 2, 2049.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a cute tradition to begin among your group of heathenistic friends and there are plenty of causes deserving of your money.  Some of you may have a Beast Day coming up soon — might as well celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re looking for a good cause, consider the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;We’re only $5,000 away from our goal&lt;/em&gt;! — See the thermometer on the right sidebar.)&lt;/p&gt;

I’m reminded of the warnings from biologists that were unheeded and initially overthrown by rule-makers during the collapse of the Northern Cod Fishery…

The CPS should only prosecute when it is the public interest to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And one should always be skeptical of newspaper reports of any court case.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the narrow point as to whether that possessing a shotgun - and taking that shotgun through the streets (even if to a police station) - should be unlawful, then I think it should be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not his civic duty to take a shotgun and ammunition through the streets of a Surrey town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until that shotgun (and ammunition) was safely in the custody of the police, there was a real risk that it could be used to kill or badly maim other people. That is why possessing such shotguns is a criminal offence, unless there is a licence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever it appears the law is an ass, one should be critical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The statutory minimum sentence may well be an ass; the decision to prosecute here may also be an ass; but prohibiting the possession of shotguns is, in my view, not an ass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the facts are as reported, then the prosecution should not have been brought; and, if brought, a conviction should only carry a mere discharge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But prohibiting the possession of the shotgun and ammunition would appear to me to be what the criminal law should be doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;16 November 2009: See thoughtful and thought-provoking blogpost at &lt;a href="http://badreason99.blogspot.com/2009/11/ignorance-of-law-and-paul-clarke-case.html"&gt; Bad Reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-197347265719137093?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258215431374"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1892">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/31140a0e858afc0d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Body and One: Corpus count fail</title><published>2009-11-14T16:02:02Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T16:02:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1892" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning we're continuing to explore the difference between &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, which all started on 11/10/2009, when David Landfair wrote to Arnold Zwicky ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1883"&gt;Ask Language Log: someone, somebody&lt;/a&gt;") to ask for protection against  the bizarre idea that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is nominative (like &lt;em&gt;he/she/who&lt;/em&gt;) while &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; is accusative (like &lt;em&gt;him/her/whom&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold offered first aid ("Yes, it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; preposterous&amp;quot;), quoted MWDEU (&amp;quot;In the 20th century, … &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; has come on strong … But both, of course, are equally standard…&amp;quot;), and suggested checking out corpus studies. I offered some corpus-based evidence that -one remains more formal than -body, and (nevertheless?) is gradually superceding it, even in conversational speech (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1884"&gt;Less body in your lexicon&lt;/a&gt;", 11/11/2009; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1890"&gt;Body loses Supreme Court appeal&lt;/a&gt;", 11/13/2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments on the second of those posts, Geoff Nunberg &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1890#comment-48864"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that "the forms in &lt;em&gt;-one&lt;/em&gt; are marked for closeness to the speaker and individuation, and thus preserve some part of the sense of &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;", citing Dwight Bolinger, and offered as evidence the Google counts for "some{body|one} special" vs. "some{body|one} or other". Along similar lines, David Cantor &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1890#comment-48873"&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; his wife's opinion that "Someone is used when referring to a specific and defined group 'Someone in this room committed the murder,' while Somebody fit better with an undefined group: 'Somebody left a mitten on the sidewalk.'" And marie-lucie &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1890#comment-48881"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that I'd start by checking Geoff's test in a number of corpora where the counts are more believable than Google counts are. (The numbers in parentheses are rates per 100 million words).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;18 (4.4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;98 (24)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;14 (3.4)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;5 (5)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;21 (21)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;11 (11)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;2 (2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;84%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LDC News&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;33 (1.3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;228 (8.9)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#99ffff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;24 (0.94)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;24 (0.94)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor="#ffaaff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the actual rates are all over the place — probably due to differences in the mixture of registers and time-periods covered — there&amp;#39;s a consistent pattern. As Geoff predicts, the proportional use of &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; is greater, in every source, for the context "__ or other" compared to the context "__ special".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we're looking at subtle proportional differences rather than categorical ones. And when we look at the hits in detail, the whole enterprise seems to fall apart. Geoff (as I understand him) wants "some{body|one} special" to represent the case where the writer or speaker has a particular individual in mind, and "some{body|one} or other" to represent the case where the reference is open. But when we check, we find that that the facts are almost exactly the opposite of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases of "some{body|one} special" are almost always either not referential at all, or entirely generic. Here's a representative sample of the COCA cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Make you feel like you were somebody special.&lt;br&gt;
You act like you're somebody special.&lt;br&gt;
I knew that it would take somebody special…&lt;br&gt;
it's just a great place to be with somebody special&lt;br&gt;
Got to have a chance to move out, to grow, to be somebody special.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Find someone special in six months, guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;
… that her baby girl would turn out to be someone special.&lt;br&gt;
Mia was the last of the trio to find someone special in her life.&lt;br&gt;
The itch to travel is strong, but go with someone special …&lt;br&gt;
Sandee had never given up on finding someone special to share her life with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in contrast, cases of "some{body|one} or other" usually refer to some specific person whose name the speaker doesn't know, or at least to a variable taking on one of a notionally specific series of values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;he remembered somebody or other saying it was simplistic&lt;br&gt;
One by one, somebody or other stopped me and asked with whom I had business&lt;br&gt;
Does a Speed somebody or other got an office in this building?&lt;br&gt;
I was reading somebody or other today who said …&lt;br&gt;
the Senate have now signed a letter saying they'll hold up the nomination of somebody or other&lt;br&gt;
I only speak to my father once or twice a year, and even then it's usually to argue about money that I owe somebody or other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Nearly every week, someone or other from the construction site headed to the emergency room.&lt;br&gt;
…a market in which everything of value should be owned by someone or other.&lt;br&gt;
my mom went visiting someone or other and probably isn't coming back&lt;br&gt;
He has his mother's large eyes and a flat mouth from Someone or other.&lt;br&gt;
what he was telling Dino, about someone or other who refused to fight in Argelia&lt;br&gt;
A man was holding forth. He was introduced as someone or other, art critic, veteran of the War, …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their face, these observations could be taken to suggest that the Bolinger/Nunberg/Cantor/marie-lucie theory is backwards: perhaps &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; really suggests specificity, given its  greater proportional usage in with specific referential intent in the &amp;quot;__ or other&amp;quot; frame?  But then again, maybe the proportional differences just reflect a difference in the frequencies of the two frames across registers, as Geoff suggested — you could get the same result if &amp;quot;__ or other&amp;quot; is simply commoner in colloquial contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difference in referential properties between &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;, if it exists, must be a relatively subtle or contextually limited one, since all sorts of referentiality/specificity conditions seem to be associated with both words in the examples given above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case,  the distribution of "__ special" and "__ or other" doesn't give much leverage on the question.  To explore this question effectively, it seems, we may not be able to find a convenient corpus-count proxy, but instead need to annotate  a larger list of examples with a better-specified set of features.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258214952539"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/the_r_word_why_we_shouldnt_fea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/647eccad940bbeab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The "R" word: why we shouldn't fear health care rationing</title><published>2009-11-14T13:14:57Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T13:14:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/9YZLwjpzSL0/the_r_word_why_we_shouldnt_fea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/the_r_word_why_we_shouldnt_fea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;An easy way to kill a debate on health care policy is to use the "R" word.  We saw this early in the HCR debate with overheated talk of "death panels" and other nonsense.  But we ignore the real issue of rationing at our own peril.  Those of us who favor real HCR must embrace rationing, coopt it, show our opponents how it is inevitable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is the the Right more hypocritical than the issue of health care rationing (OK, maybe with sex stuff, but...). Everyone who studies American health care knows that &lt;a href="http://covertrationingblog.com/"&gt;we already ration&lt;/a&gt;; we just do it irrationally.  Current rationing allocates resources to the wealthy and those with good jobs, and when we do care for the uninsured, unevenly spreads that cost to some hospitals and taxpayers.  Medical services are reimbursed in an unstable fashion, with some services reimbursed well one year, and poorly the next, making planning nearly impossible for doctors, hospitals, and patients.  For example, there are currently large cuts planned for some cardiology services, cuts which I don't disagree with in theory but cardiologists cannot provide good service to their patients if one year they are encouraged to go out and buy lots of fancy equipment and the next year are told they can't use it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hospitals struggle from year to year as economic downturns change the payor mix driving down income.  There is no stability in our current system.  It is not robust, for providers or for patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/the_r_word_why_we_shouldnt_fea.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/the_r_word_why_we_shouldnt_fea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/9YZLwjpzSL0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258212932452"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/my_visit_to_purdue.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29d81805036394bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">My visit to Purdue</title><published>2009-11-14T12:48:35Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T12:48:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/77OFly1PE6o/my_visit_to_purdue.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/my_visit_to_purdue.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jen has the &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/11/pz-myers-speaks-at-purdue-few-things.html"&gt;full account&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a video, of my talk.

Never use the on-line upgrade option to switch to a newer version of the operating system! In little more than two years, it has trashed my setup twice, once killing the machine outright, and the last time (yesterday) making it impossible to boot from the linux partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the time comes to upgrade, copy all your files to somewhere else, re-format the linux partition and install the new Ubuntu version from scratch. Then copy all your stuff back onto the partition. There is no safe way to upgrade an existing installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corollary of this is that you should either use an on-line e-mail service that stores your mail off-site, or local e-mail software that makes it really easy to export all your mail to another disk and then re-import it into the software after the upgrade (if any such e-mail software does in fact exist). In other words, do not run Mozilla Thunderbird like I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/11/upgrading_ubuntu_linux_is_risk.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/GZgvQ7CXtSI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258207615637"><id gr:original-id="781 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e0fd17c07942bf8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Physical Sciences" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/science/physical-sciences"/><category term="History of Science" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/history/history-science"/><title type="html">Venera 3 Launched</title><published>2009-11-14T14:14:36Z</published><updated>2009-11-14T14:14:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/781" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;Date: &lt;em&gt;1965-11-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_3"&gt;Venera 3&lt;/a&gt; is launched by the Soviet Union, later becoming the first space probe to reach the surface of another planet.t&lt;/p&gt;

Not coincidentally, church and state are closely intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/11/12/09/comelec-says-gay-party-immoral"&gt;Recent case in point&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Commission on Elections (Comelec) on Wednesday rejected Ang Ladlad for party-list accreditation on the grounds that the party advocates “sexual immorality” and “immoral doctrines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ang Ladlad is an organization of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://abs-cbnnews.com/research/11/12/09/comelecs-resolution-ang-ladlads-petition-register-sectoral-party"&gt;a ruling dated November 11&lt;/a&gt;, the Comelec said that although the party presented proper documents and evidence for their accreditation, their petition is “dismissable on moral grounds.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the political party for LGBT people has been dismissed and will not become official because they are being accused of “sexual immorality” and being a threat to Filipino youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, COMELAC quoted the Bible and Koran in its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheist &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Tani&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://filipinovoices.com/oppose-comelec-support-the-ang-ladlad-movement/"&gt;is appalled by this&lt;/a&gt;.  He and other non-theists are taking a stand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In any case, the religious biases of three (or six) individuals should not be imposed on the millions who have their own beliefs, not to mention their own equal, unalienable human rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to spend any more time talking about why COMELEC’s ruling is an atrocity. This is no longer the time for talk. It’s time to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you support Ang Ladlad, the LGBT movement, and the Human Rights movement, if you want to protect the freedom and equality granted by our secular Constitution, then join us tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details on that meeting &lt;a href="http://filipinovoices.com/oppose-comelec-support-the-ang-ladlad-movement/comment-page-1#comment-112710"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have an uphill climb but it makes me proud that the non-theists represent the side that supports civil rights for everyone.  We’re on the right side of history, regardless of the country.  Even the religious people will come along… eventually.  But groups like the &lt;a href="http://filipinofreethinkers.org/"&gt;Filipino Freethinkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=164982408097"&gt;Filipinos for Secular Government&lt;/a&gt; are leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;

A (more or less recent) trend is Web 2.0, community-driven websites like &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and the plethora of country-specific &lt;a href="http://www.studivz.net/"&gt;look-alikes&lt;/a&gt;. So scientists from the University of Zurich took a look at this.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
They were fascinated, and &lt;a href="http://www.uzh.ch/news/articles/2009/facebook-allein-macht-nicht-gluecklich.html"&gt;they designed a study (German)&lt;/a&gt;. That's when it all went pear-shaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychologists Anett Cepela and &lt;a href="http://www.sozpsy.uzh.ch/team/bmeyer.html"&gt;Bertold Meyer&lt;/a&gt; were not writing a theoretically well-founded &lt;a href="http://qntm.org/?facebook"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; on the pre-shaped social interactions of social networking sites, they wanted to look at something more fundamental: &lt;em&gt;What people use Facebook and why?&lt;/em&gt; Unfortunately, their efforts  failed to provide any meaningful results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a study from 2007 by scientists of the Michigan State University (not referenced in the university's announcement), that found users of social networks are generally more satisfied and happier because of their higher social commitment, Cepela and Meyer designed an online-questionnaire with items on personality and social network usage that was completed by 681 participants, 573 of which used Facebook, and 335 used at least one additional social networking site. The rate of male (336) and female (345) participants was almost identical, the average number of "friends" claimed via their most-used social network was 187 (no idea whether this is arithmetical, median or mode&lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this data, they tried to find agreements between the Web 2.0-usage and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"&gt; so called "Big Five" personality traits&lt;/a&gt;, a model based on five dimensions of personality: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Openness_to_Experience"&gt;Openness to Experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Conscientiousness"&gt;Conscientiousness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Extraversion"&gt;Extraversion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Agreeableness"&gt;Agreeableness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Neuroticism"&gt;Neuroticism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results? Meyer is quoted: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Extraversion as a dimension of personality is accounted for, it can be seen that extroverted people can be found more often on Facebook and are quite satisfied with it. [...] [But,] if there was no Facebook, extroverted people would find other ways to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words of wisdom, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning our attention to the 62 non-users of social networks, at least Meyer cautions against over-generalisation, but nevertheless tells us that non-users rank high on the Conscientiousness-scale. And, since "other studies" (again, not referenced in the PR-blurb) found a high correlation between Conscientiousness and job-related success, that, according to Meyer, inevitably means that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;people who are not participating in social networks are more conscientious and enjoy a higher rate of success in their professional careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing nobody told them of social networks founded explicitly for furthering your career, like &lt;a href="http://www.xing.com/"&gt;XING&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as usual with studies like this, there is a teeny qualifier at the end, jsut so the authors don't have to deal with pesky things like "scientific thoroughness" or "accountability":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-users are also older on average than the Facebook-users, which could play a role in these results. Further studies are to be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The study itself does not seem to be available online (no reference even on &lt;a href="http://www.sozpsy.uzh.ch/team/bmeyer.html"&gt;Meyer's university homepage&lt;/a&gt;; Cepela doesn't even have such a page), nor is it referenced in the university's PR-piece. If anyone can give me direct access to it, that would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s articulett’s story of the mutant moggie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived home late from work last Friday, and as I pulled into my driveway, I noticed a strange cat.  He didn’t dash away as most strange cats did.  Instead he sauntered over to my car as if to say, “It’s about time you got home”.  It was then I noticed his curly ears.  I had never seen such a mutation.  I knew about the “Scottish Fold”, but their ears bent forward; these curled back.  I figured that if I gave him some food, maybe he’d stick around for me to study him, but he had bolder plans.  He walked right into my home where an effusive dog and a couple of spoiled house-cats lived.  He listened patiently to their complaints and smacked the dog on the nose when she got too close.  His attitude seemed to be “I’m here–I have queer ears–get used to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a little internet searching, and it turns out that there is a type of cat with curled ears called an “American Curl”.  This particular American Curl had no collar and hasn’t shown any inclination to leave.  In fact, he seems to have installed himself as the “King of Beasts” in my home, and the other occupants are to too flummoxed to protest.  His ears give him a teddy-bearish/ocelot look which constantly makes me giggle–at some angles they look like horns, and at others they give the “hollow mask illusion” where it’s hard to tell which part pokes in and which part sticks out..  I adore felines and mutants, so this serendipity-kitty is right up my alley.  What’s not to love?  (I’ve been avoiding reading the lost ads, because I’m afraid he might be someone’s pet, and I’ve grown very attached to him.  — Besides, he’s convinced he lives at my home.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/curly.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Curly" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/curly.jpg?w=486&amp;amp;h=335" alt="Curly" width="486" height="335"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps readers would like to suggest a name? Articulett wanted to avoid “Curly,” of Three Stooges fame, as the name is too obvious.  I thought that “Jerry” might be appropriate given that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Howard"&gt;Curly Howard’s real name&lt;/a&gt; was Jerome Lester “Jerry” Horwitz.  I’ll offer a free autographed copy of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; to any reader’s suggestion that is actually adopted by articulett. (Note: there’s no guarantee that he/she will adopt any of the suggestions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/american-curl.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the American Curl breed, which stems from a single autosomal dominant  mutation that arose in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;

The Boston Coalition of Reason ad read:  “Good without God? 40 Million Americans are.” Sadly, the faith of some Christians is so fragile that even that posed a serious threat to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although plants have the ability to sense and respond to other plants, their ability to recognize kin and act altruistically has been the subject of few studies. The authors explored kin recognition in Impatiens pallida (yellow jewelweed). By moving their resources into leaves, these plants not only positively affected their own growth, but also negatively affected their competitors’ growth. This is the first instance where researchers demonstrated that a plant’s response to an aboveground cue is dependent upon the presence of a belowground cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But is there really anyone who thinks the claim is beneath &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and Generation Rescue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="karate chop" src="http:///2009/11/karate-chop.jpg" alt="karate chop" width="481" height="332"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m here to tell you that such physical feats as board breaking can be performed &amp;amp; explained simply by referencing the known laws of physics – no woo required.  Take a look at the video of me performing such a break with five pine boards at once…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vQSVHL4Qwe0?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I accomplish this feat?  Here’s how: I hit the boards &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt; – the question is how do I generate such a large force of impact?  Read on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1. Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; First off, there’s a good reason why I’m hitting pine boards – they are a &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; wood.  Whenever I’ve seen martial artists doing breaks such as these, they hit either pine boards or a brittle material like clay bricks or concrete slabs.  In addition, when striking wooden boards, successful strikes always go with the grain of the wood because the wood is structurally weaker in that orientation.  So, in a real sense, karate practitioners are kind of cheating by using these materials – if you really wanted to see something impressive &amp;amp; “supernatural”, perhaps someone could display slicing through a steel I-beam with the edge of their hand.  I think there’s a pretty good reason why we never see a “chi-master” doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;!  ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Spacers:&lt;/strong&gt; Notice the spacers that I’ve got placed in between the boards.  This is another common trick that is used whenever board breaking is performed.  By separating the boards like this, I really only have to break one at a time as opposed to one large, massive chunk.  In more technical terms, the momentum of my strike is slightly reduced by breaking only the top board, which allows the remainder of my hand’s momentum to continue to the next board, and the next after that and so on.  This works for the same reason why train cars are slightly decoupled from one another – once the engine gets moving, its momentum helps to move the next car when the coupling catches, and their combined momentum help to get the third car moving when its coupling catches, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Impulse-Momentum Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; the rest of it has to do with the physics of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_momentum_theorem"&gt;impulse&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"&gt;momentum.&lt;/a&gt; In equation form, this theorem (which is another way of expressing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_second_law"&gt;Newton’s 2nd Law&lt;/a&gt;) can be written as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; Δt = m Δ&lt;strong&gt;v&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;or&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; = m Δ&lt;strong&gt;v&lt;/strong&gt; / Δt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;where &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; is the force of impact, Δt is the time of impact, m is the mass behind the strike, and Δ&lt;strong&gt;v&lt;/strong&gt; is the change in velocity of striking hand (or foot).  In order to break the boards, one must maximize the force of impact, which can be done in a variety of ways…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;Maximize the mass:&lt;/em&gt; instead of merely hitting the boards with my fist, I turn &amp;amp; twist my entire body into the strike.  By doing so the mass (m) is greatly increased, and so too is the force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;Minimize the impact time:&lt;/em&gt; the boards are placed onto solid supports (in this case the stools) which do not give under the impact.  Because the supports are not excessively elastic or bouncy, the time of impact is reduced to a minimum, which has the effect of greatly increasing the force of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;Maximize the velocity:&lt;/em&gt; by dropping my body mass so dramatically, I convert a large amount of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy#Gravitational_potential_energy"&gt;gravitational potential energy&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"&gt;kinetic energy.&lt;/a&gt; And since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity of an object, by doing so I provide a great deal of velocity (and therefore momentum) which can carry all the way through all five boards as previously mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So there you have it, folks – a thorough explanation of how such board breaking feats are done, without a mention of chi/ki/qigong or any other supernatural woo-woo.  This is a very good example of applying &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Occam%27s_Razor"&gt;Occam’s Razor&lt;/a&gt;, and I thoroughly enjoy sharing this lesson with my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Sadly, there are those who would rather deny scientific reality &amp;amp; the laws of nature in favor of the delusion that they have some kind of mystical power over “chi energy” and can therefore do physically impossible things.  And even more sadly, these delusions can lead some people into serious injury.  Here are two examples of what I’m talking about…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;The first is of one of these so-called “chi-masters” who believes that he can throw people merely by “projecting his energy” at them, but – interestingly – he only seems to be able to perform these “throws” on his true-believing students.  What happens when he encounters someone who isn’t a true-believer in his abilities?  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDaCIDvj6I"&gt;Take a look at this video to find out:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gEDaCIDvj6I?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;There is an entire group, almost &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/cults.html"&gt;cultish&lt;/a&gt; in nature, called &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/yellowbamboo.html"&gt;Yellow Bamboo&lt;/a&gt; that purports to teach people how to “focus &amp;amp; project their chi” with equal levels of failure.  Just search Youtube and you’ll find plenty of videos of the Yellow Bamboo woo-meisters getting pwned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;But if &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; isn’t bad enough, here’s a whole other level of fail… this next clown is so far down the “chi-master” rabbit-hole that he actually believes that by “focusing his chi energy” he can make himself &lt;em&gt;impervious to blades.&lt;/em&gt; And to prove it, he hacks into his own arm with a razor-sharp machete!  How do you think it went? (&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; not for the squeamish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i5hCczfGYv0?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Folks, in my opinion, it just doesn’t get much more stupid than that.  The moral of the story is simple: when it’s you and your beliefs vs. the laws of physics, &lt;em&gt;physics always wins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Dr. Isis,

&lt;p&gt;I've been following your blog for a while and I love it!  I'm writing to you now because I'm a postdoc and just returned from a meeting that reaffirmed my need to embrace my  femininity.  Even more than that, I need to talk to other women about it.  At almost every meeting I've ever attended I've been hit on.  Not like, "So, are you new in the field?" but as in, "why don't you come to my room and talk about your research?".  Or my favorite, "Why did you get married? You're not using your assets to your advantage." I don't think I'm a member of the Swedish bikini team, but I'm not unattractive and I'm very outgoing and (I think) very likable, but for the longest time I made sure to wear the most unflattering clothes possible to meetings.  That is until I realized that it doesn't matter.  Shit happens, there are men that will always be pigs, and it doesn't matter if you're wearing a burka or a bar maid outfit.  So when I got my first talk at an international meeting and was nominated for an award I was determined to finally look like a girl again because, damn it, I can obviously do science otherwise I wouldn't be up for this award when I'm in the lab of a nobody in the field.  And I was right.  Nothing has really changed, I can look like a girl, and roughly the same percentage of slime hits on me, and the same larger percentage of nice, dorky scientists treat me like one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the reason I'm writing you is because you have a very successful blog that actually gets to the heart of being a woman in science and wanting to maintain the feeling of being a sexy, feminine woman without sacrificing the science.  I also know I can't be the only one that deals with this type of thing, but I have a hard time finding other girls who do, perhaps because they don't feel like it happens to anyone else.  In order to get more of us talking, I've just started a facebook group called "I'm sorry, did my chest get in the way of your science?".  I think that this way, if girls want to share their story, they can, and if they don't then they can read about it from other girls, and it creates some camaraderie.  I don't know how you feel about facebook, or if you have a page, but I would love it if you would join my group or even just give me some suggestions.  I'm trying to spread the word, but the flow of info between women of science can be slowed by the lack of connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Victoria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out this new Facebook group &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=173472651508&amp;amp;ref=search&amp;amp;sid=1598352566.1849233557..1&amp;amp;v=info"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are two things about Victoria's email that hit home with me.  First, I think few men realize how pervasive harassment at meetings is. There is something about the combination of alcohol, a more relaxed setting, and being away from the traditional academic setting that brings out the best and worst in some people. Second, Victoria is entirely right that it does not matter what the woman is wearing - barmaid's costume or burqa.  Some men view meetings as prime opportunities to behave like cockweaseldouchemonkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her email Victoria asks for suggestions.  The only suggestion I have is to keep having the conversation.  The more women feel able to talk about this, the closer we'll come to fixing the problem. I think these digital media are interesting.  I am intrigued by the ability these places (blogs, Facebook) have to build communities that would not normally, or at least easily, form in academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've joined the group on Facebook and there are already some interesting things up on the wall.  I'd encourage my readers to go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tell Victoria I say "hello."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/a_digital_place_for_women_in_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/0fwantTFRos" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258155144276"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/genetics_in_advertising_fail.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6d6096b5aef90f43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stuff You Send Me"/><title type="html">Genetics in Advertising FAIL?</title><published>2009-11-13T21:23:21Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T21:23:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/Ca3_LlxE0hI/genetics_in_advertising_fail.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/genetics_in_advertising_fail.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis is back to blogging after a few days hiatus.  I would love to tell you that I was away doing something wonderfully glamorous, but the truth is that I had a case of the stomach flu and spent about 48 hours in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman-vomiting-ipecac.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/woman-vomiting-ipecac.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="250" width="195"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_10yYjoTIYE0/ShGUmm6hfHI/AAAAAAAACsQ/kfj7pJlhBds/s400/woman-vomiting-ipecac.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: The only thing I can say is that, even when I am vomiting, I am still totally hot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I think I am back in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely reader Virginia recent sent me this email that I wanted to share with you....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Dr. Isis,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dad doesn't look too concerned that the milkman is obviously the father of two of his children.....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And with the email she included this online advertisement from &lt;a href="http://www.childrensplace.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/home_10001_10001_-1"&gt;The Children's Place&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="genetics fail ad.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/genetics%20fail%20ad.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="460" width="515"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt; I realize this may be a bit hard to see at this resolution, so I took the liberty of enlarging the relevant bits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="eyes fail.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/eyes%20fail.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="291" width="515"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say I blame this woman.  I am not sure I could bone the guy in the polar bear pajamas either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/11/genetics_in_advertising_fail.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/Ca3_LlxE0hI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258154423425"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab60d5f590629c06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Plunder Unto God</title><published>2009-11-13T21:14:25Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T21:14:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/773-plunder-unto-god.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Apocalypse has arrived for the second year in a row.  In God's corner is a swarm of angry churches led by a group called the Alliance Defense Fund. In Satan's corner is, of course, the Internal Revenue Service.  September 27, 2009 was "Pulpit Freedom Sunday" and it has caused churches across the nation risk their tax exempt status by making political statements and even explicitly endorse political candidates in open violation of tax law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alliance Defense Fund is a legal organization unafraid of controversy, so their civil disobedience is hardly surprising. Its list of founders includes people like James Dobson (Focus on the Family) and Bill Bright, winner of the infamous $1.1 million Templeton Prize. On their &lt;a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/about/Employment/Default.aspx"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; they tell prospective employees that they must "be ready, willing, and able to participate in public and private prayer" both "during working and non-working hours."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Alliance Defense Fund is arguing that churches in America are being persecuted.  They believe (without good legal precedent) that the IRS restrictions on churches amount to an unconstitutional limitation on their freedom of speech and need to be repealed.  In response, they've organized a movement called the "&lt;a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/9835?search=1"&gt;Pulpit Freedom Initiative&lt;/a&gt;" and enlisted 83 churches in 30 states to help them in their cause.  The initiative encourages pastors of all denominations to give political sermons from their pulpit as a form of civil disobedience. The ultimate goal is the provocation of a test case.  If the IRS decides to drop the hammer on a rebelling church, the ADF will swoop in and attempt to take it all the way to the Supreme Court in hopes of getting the laws overturned on a national scale.  Does the ADF have realistic chance?  Do their claims hold water?  The short answer is "no." The long answer requires a crash course in tax law.</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Matt Fiore)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258154330963"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=18252">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e3a3c0ae46b0acb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Advertising"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Graffiti on a Boston Atheist Ad</title><published>2009-11-13T23:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T23:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/13/graffiti-on-a-boston-atheist-ad/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t even understand this recent vandalism of a &lt;a href="http://boston.unitedcor.org/"&gt;Boston Coalition of Reason&lt;/a&gt; advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They crossed out the “out” in “without” — that’s been &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/05/atheist-billboard-vandalized-again/"&gt;done before&lt;/a&gt; — but why bother putting the words “Are you” in front?  That’s just redundant.  (Anyway, the answer is no.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nice job crossing out the group’s website.  Now, no one will know where to go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wrote “kill for” in the bottom background?  That doesn’t even make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, vandals.  This is weak.  You can do better than that.  All you have to do is put a &lt;a href="http://boston.cor.org/"&gt;period in the URL&lt;/a&gt; and everyone will be confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see the error where you meant to type "upgraded."  So you right click on it to pick the correct spelling, and accidentally hit the "Add to Dictionary" menu choice, which is annoyingly placed right next to the correctly spelled word.  &lt;/p&gt;

Pertussis, measles, and now mumps are cropping up after long periods of quiescence.  Mumps has been generally very well-controlled since the adoption of wide-spread vaccination, with no nation-wide outbreaks, but there have been a number of regional outbreaks, most notably in 2006 and now again in 2009.  Since the widespread use of two-dose vaccines, mumps cases in the US have dropped by more than 99%.

In an analysis of the 2006 outbreak the authors noted a three year periodicity to wide-spread mumps epidemics,and predicted a 2009 outbreak similar to the 2006 outbreak based on pre-outbreak epidemiology..  It appears they were right.  The CDC is reporting a sudden outbreak among a religious community in the Northeast (they don&amp;#39;t say it explicitly but it appears to be an Orthodox Jewish community).  The disease appears to have  been imported from an ongoing UK outbreak, and then to have spread through the close quarters of a summer camp. As children returned home from camp, the disease spread through their communities.

She has a new blog post up entitled ‘&lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Millions, billions, trillions”…of scientific errors in the NYT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘. Yikes! Here’s how it begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the New York Times published an article on the North Pacific Gyre called “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=1&amp;amp;em"&gt;Afloat in the Ocean, Expanding Islands of Trash.&lt;/a&gt;” Written by Lindsay Hoshaw, it was the culmination of a $10,000 freelance journalism project* in which she visited the gyre with the Algalita Marine Research Foundation. Unfortunately, this NYT article was far below their usual standards. Not only did it &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,5594900.story"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15713260"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jul/10-the-worlds-largest-dump"&gt;anything&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec08/plasticocean_11-13.html"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; to the discussion, but it significantly misrepresented the state of the science, presenting broad estimates &amp;amp; conjecture as facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent a list of corrections to the New York Times, and I am republishing them here as well. They are in the order they appear in the article. Because there are so many, I have kept each explanation brief, but please ask in the comments if you would like elaboration. Thanks to my SIO colleagues Kristen Marhaver and Mike Navarro for their suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;In this remote patch of the Pacific Ocean, hundreds of miles from any national boundary, the detritus of human life is collecting in a swirling current so large that it defies precise measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gyre is not a current, but a lack of currents. Please see &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/08/04/coriolis-force-and-convergence-zones/"&gt;Pete’s explanation of convergence zones&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s only the beginning… Go &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/"&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you're a metal detectorist and you &lt;a href="http://roskilde.lokalavisen.dk/et-unikt-fund-af-odin-fra-lejre/20091113/artikler/711139709"&gt;find a silver figurine&lt;/a&gt; at storied Lejre in Denmark. It depicts a person sitting in a high seat whose posts end in two wolves' heads. And on either arm rest sits a raven. The style is typical for about AD 900. So when you hand the thing over to the site manager, he of course exclaims, "Holy shit! It's Odin!". And that's what he tells the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until somebody like me comes along and points out that it's a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She's wearing a floor-length dress. And a shawl. And four finely sculpted bead strings. This is a standard depiction of an aristocratic lady of the later 1st Millennium. The Lejre figurine is a direct counterpart to the Aska pendant (below), which is universally understood as the effigy of a goddess. The high seat is Odin's, allright. But the occupant is most likely Frigga or Freya. Or maybe, just maybe, Thor in drag during the hammer reclamation mission. That is so cool! This find will mess with everybody's mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to detectorist Tommy Olesen who found the piece two months ago! And thanks to Tobias Bondesson for the heads-up.&lt;/p&gt;

Pertussis, measles, and now mumps are cropping up after long periods of quiescence.  Mumps has been generally very well-controlled since the adoption of wide-spread vaccination, with no nation-wide outbreaks, but there have been a number of regional outbreaks, most notably in 2006 and &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d1112a1.htm"&gt;now again in 2009&lt;/a&gt;.  Since the widespread use of two-dose vaccines, mumps cases in the US have dropped by more than 99%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of the 2006 outbreak the authors noted a three year periodicity to wide-spread mumps epidemics,and predicted a 2009 outbreak similar to the 2006 outbreak based on pre-outbreak epidemiology..  It appears they were right.  The CDC is reporting a sudden outbreak among a religious community in the Northeast (they don&amp;#39;t say it explicitly but it appears to be an Orthodox Jewish community).  The disease appears to have  been imported from an ongoing UK outbreak, and then to have spread through the close quarters of a summer camp. As children returned home from camp, the disease spread through their communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/mumps_redux.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/mumps_redux.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/irJsf6ZHI0g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258149054104"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b88e95f338d5a46</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Physics"/><title type="html">The Physics of Touching your Toes!</title><published>2009-11-13T21:38:11Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T21:38:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can you touch your toes?  Seems like an easy thing to do for those of us who have the flexibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t/touch_toes.jpg" width="500" alt="touch_toes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's the challenge.  Stand with your back and your heels pressed up against a wall, and &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; try to touch your toes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t/touch_toes.gif" width="500" alt="touch_toes.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can't do it!&lt;/b&gt;  Not without putting your hands down on the floor, you can't.  There's a super-simple reason for this: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass"&gt;center-of-mass&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t/cog-poses-2.jpeg" width="500" height="318" alt="cog-poses-2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For human beings, your center-of-mass is somewhere in your abdomen.  It's lower down for women than men, but in the abdomen region for everyone.  When you typically bend down to touch your toes, you'll notice that the upper part of your body moves forwards, while the lower part moves backwards.  You do this by default, but the major reason you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to do this is so that your center-of-mass stays over a stable point: &lt;b&gt;your feet!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t/img_27381.jpg" width="500" alt="img_27381.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as you prop yourself up against the wall, the lower part of your body can't move back!  So as the upper part moves forward, your center of mass moves forward.  It goes from being over your heels to being over your arches to your toes, and the instant it extends out beyond your toes, you know what happens?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin to &lt;i&gt;rotate&lt;/i&gt;, and once that happens, you're going to fall, like so:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t/fig2.JPG.jpeg" width="500" alt="fig2.JPG.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/gvarieschi/chimney/chimney_pg2.html"&gt;Gabrielle Varieschi&lt;/a&gt;.)  And that's it!  This is a great trick to try on children to teach them about stability.  It's also great for physics teachers to introduce torque, rotation, and center-of-mass.  (And on unsuspecting coworkers to teach them about falling on their faces!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a remarkable phenomenon that such a simple thing as touching your toes would be off-limits with your heels against a wall, but there it is!  Don't believe me?  Try it yourself and see what happens, but I warned you...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/the_physics_of_touching_your_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258147971417"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/linux_terminal_fun_find_out_ab.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1848f960647fee97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="OpenSource"/><title type="html">Linux Terminal Fun: Find out about your hardware</title><published>2009-11-13T21:06:01Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T21:06:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/qsGlJSRWWDs/linux_terminal_fun_find_out_ab.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/linux_terminal_fun_find_out_ab.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The command dmidecode is " is a tool for dumping a computer's DMI (some say SMBIOS) table contents in a human-readable format.

After all, her organization Generation Rescue &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1195"&gt;has shamefully blamed them on totally unrelated things before&lt;/a&gt;, and no doubt will again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a serious topic, since the antivaxxers are a public health menace, and the rise of preventable diseases can in many cases be traced back to their propaganda. But sometimes, just sometimes, mocking them is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

(The actual &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes"&gt;antipodes&lt;/a&gt; would be in the middle of an ocean.)  Looking forward to it, as this will mean I’ve visited every non-Antarctic continent at least once.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason I’m blogging about it is because I’ll be giving some public talks, and it would be great if any local CV readers dropped by to say hi.  I’ll be hitting three different cities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday 16 November:  &lt;a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=2&amp;amp;newsstoryid=4170"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday 20 November: &lt;a href="http://physics.unimelb.edu.au/Community/Newsroom/Events/CosPA-2009-Free-Public-Lecture-The-Origin-of-the-Universe-and-the-Arrow-of-Time"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday 23 November: &lt;a href="http://www.sciences.adelaide.edu.au/keys_to_the_universe.html#carroll"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these public talks in a row, you would almost think I’m touring in support of some sort of &lt;a href="http://eternitytohere.com/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.  That was part of the original idea, but now the book won’t be officially released until January 7.  So instead I’ll just be talking in support of … Science!  And trying to stay clear of &lt;a href="http://www.yesaustralia.com/Curiosidades-animaising.htm"&gt;dangerous creatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.  Wow, I almost did an incredibly boneheaded thing by showing up at the airport without a visa.  Why in the world do you need a visa to go from the USA to Australia?  I thought it was like a southern version of Canada.  Fortunately, when you check in online you get “reminded” that a visa is required; even more fortunately, there is an online instant-visa service that seems to work.  This is why I’m a theoretical physicist and not put in charge of anything important.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of news stories to get the debate ball hurtling down the hill into an open can of worms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8356621.stm"&gt;Microsoft disconnect around 1million X-box owners&lt;/a&gt; who have modified their consoles to play pirated or unofficial games. Those users will now have to buy another machine to play online. &lt;em&gt;Tracy’s verdict: ha ha! Good. It’s very clear in the terms (and by the fact that you can’t get the mod officially) that such things are illegal, and MS has every right to lay the smackdown on those who violate its terms. You take the risk, you pay the price if you get caught. Of course, no doubt there’s already another mod to get round the ban, but some people will do anything to defend their right to do whatever it is they got caught doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Govt (and, I believe, USA, but would like a decent source for that) is &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8328820.stm"&gt;considering disconnecting file-sharers&lt;/a&gt; from their broadband networks. &lt;em&gt;Tracy’s verdict: unless the Govt can prove that the file-sharer in question is the only person in the household to which the connection belongs, then this is nothing more than ‘group punishment’ and as such not only undemocratic, but plain old unfair. The trade-off seems interesting, in which the law would be changed to allow people to copy CDs to their iPod and for family, but without more detail it’s hard to say if that’s lip service. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology/2009/11/12/spotify-delays-us-launch-begins-speculation-that-free-streaming-might-end-115875-21816734/"&gt;Spotify delays its US launc&lt;/a&gt;h. Some speculate that signals an end to the ‘free’ usage model. Spotify isn’t technically piracy, because it now has an agreement with music publishers whereby it compensates them like regular radio stations do. The trouble is, some artists have been complaining that the level of payment is far below that of a regular radio station, and many users of the service use software like Audio Hijack to download the tracks, which is straightforward piracy. &lt;em&gt;Tracy’s verdict: Spotify is a house of cards. I noticed a while back that they’re no longer allowing new users to sign up to the free service, under what looks to me like the pretence of issuing limited numbers of ‘invites’. I’d be surprised if any invites are issued, given the estimated cost of running the service are millions. I don’t believe for a second that the number of paying subscribers plus the advertising revenue can be covering anywhere near Spotify’s costs, and while its business model didn’t include having to actually pay for the music it streamed, it was probably a great idea for the owners. Now it’s more or less ‘fair’, it’s a crappy business model. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues around piracy seem clear: some people like to get something for free when they can get away with not being caught. Many pirates disagree with the notion of ‘ownership’, claiming that to duplicate something takes nothing away from the owners. Others claim that if they like a pirated movie or album, they’ll buy a copy (I find that a thin defence. Imagine if you took that approach with meals you had. It doesn’t make it OK not to pay just because something isn’t to your taste, unless it is broken. That’s why there are demos, previews, trailers, etc. And many retailers will take back CDs, DVDs and games within 30 days, no questions asked). If the risks were higher, fewer people would pirate. Whenever there’s a crackdown, piracy rates fall for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, as demonstrated by published stats like “1 in 20 music tracks are illegally downloaded”, if enough people are doing it, it becomes unpolicable, a broken model. Entire generations have no ethical problem with piracy, but the music, game and movie industries HAVE to make a profit if they are to continue making new content. Very few people invest without wanting a return. If it costs a million pounds to market a new artist, that money has to come back, with profit. If it costs £100m to make a movie, the studios and investors want more than their money back. And they will plough some of those profits into riskier projects which aren’t directed by Michael Bay. The British game development market is in the toilet, and won’t attract new investors while profit is threatened by piracy. These are extremely difficult issues. Everyone wants quality product, but many don’t want to pay for it at all, many others only want to pay for it after they deem it quality, and those who do pay are overcharged. So, to my questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it OK to download something free when the maker intended you to pay for it? If the current model is broken, what is the solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To communicate effectively in this situation, you have to extract the relevant information from the noise in the background, as well as from other voices. To do so, your brain somehow "tags" the predictable, repeating elements of the target signal, such as the pitch of your friend's voice, and segregates them from other signals in the surroundings, which fluctuate randomly.

The ability to focus on your friend's voice while excluding other noises is commonly referred to as the cocktail party effect. Although first described more than 50 years ago, the brain mechanisms involved are unknown. But a new study by researchers at Northwestern University now shows that activity in regions of the brainstem are modulated by specific characteristics of the speaker's voice, and that this modulation is impaired in children with dyslexia.

I was less than impressed with the lack of action taken by Trading Standards and the MHRA.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
I contacted each organisation once more to follow up on my original correspondence. Yet again, Trading Standards have failed to respond - even to acknowledge receipt of my email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA, on the other hand, have not only responded promptly to my follow-up email, but have also said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your message. I can confirm we shall be investigating this complaint and taking any appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA took just one day to respond to my email, and have confirmed that they are at least investigating the complaint and action will be taken, should they deem it appropriate. Trading Standards, meanwhile, are yet to respond to me - having had a week in which to do so. In the four months since I originally contacted them, I haven't had any kind of response whatsoever from Trading Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the email I sent to North Yorkshire County Council:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with regard to a company based in Skipton and my correspondence with North Yorkshire Trading Standards regarding this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted North Yorkshire Trading Standards in July regarding possible breaches of consumer protection and health and nutrition claims regulations and did not receive a response. I followed up on this 7 days ago, having noted that the website that may breach said regulations remains unaltered. I am yet to receive any kind of response either to the original contact made in July, or to my follow-up email (sent a week ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that North Yorkshire Trading Standards have failed to respond to my emails, neither to inform me of what action (if any) would be taken nor even to acknowledge that they are in receipt of my emails, I thought the best course of action would be to contact North Yorkshire County Council itself and ask for guidance on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company in question is Principle Healthcare Limited, and the address on their website is recorded as being in "Skipton, North Yorkshire" - &lt;a href="http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm" title="http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm"&gt;http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have also altered a few incidental details of his story to make him less identifiable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m interested in your opinion on this matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a radical Atheist, as Douglas Adams was known to say, he preferred to put the term “radical” there because it conveys the fact that he really meant it.  Unfortunately I am also pretty much in the closet with regards to my lack of belief at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is at work.  My coworker in the next cube over is always ranting and raving about god and country.  He’s a stereotypical Glenn Beck viewer, I could very easily envision him disrupting a Town Hall meeting if you get my drift.  He thinks President Obama is an evil socialist Muslim from another country who wants to abort all the babies and kill all the grannies.  Of course, he thinks atheists are the root of all evil and the problems of our country are caused by our abandoning god.  I think he suspects I am an Atheist, perhaps because of the FSM logo on the back of my car.  He recently put up a sign on his cabinet that reads “God Bless America” with a flag background.  I suspect he is trying to provoke me into a discussion when I have zero interest in having one with him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes for an uncomfortable workplace.  I work on computer software so I can do my job with headphones on and I find myself turning the music up lately to drown my coworker out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, should I say something to him?  I’d like to simply ask him to stop.  I feel like he is trying to lure me into a discussion of religion just so he can try to evangelize and push his agenda.  He has already made it known he has had a run in with HR when he was going around with a sign up sheet to raise money for his anti-abortion group.  I personally feel such talk at the office is inappropriate.  I think he wants to be a martyr with his loud offensive bullying talk.  I suspect he wants me to say something and of course would claim I am somehow oppressing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another wrench in the works is my manager, who can’t go two sentences without dropping a comment affirming his own religiousness.  My manager even has a cup in his office from an evangelist college.  It’s the kind of place that I would be amazed if they were accredited in any way.  I suspect he may be a graduate from there.  He also has a bible on his desk.  So my manager is a devout Christian and so is his manager.  My manager is also known as a cost cutter who has laid people off to save money.  I wouldn’t want him to have any reason to fire me because I think he would do so in a heartbeat.  If my manager were to find out I was an atheist he would probably take an interest in converting me and it would probably change his opinion of me for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work at a pretty large company with an HR department, do you think I should go to HR over my coworker?  Am I wrong for wanting him to keep his ill-informed opinions to himself?  Should I just suck it up?    I have a wife, kids and a mortgage to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;
Brett
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Brett,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up the strategic situation, your coworker is a childish, boorish, paranoid, evangelizing activist who is annoying you with his loud and distracting blather, your manager is a devout evangelical Christian who uses an axe to protect the company profit margin, and &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; manager is also a devout Christian. You have a mortgage and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think sucking it up or turning the music in the headphones up even louder will be a lasting solution.  It’s just going to wear you down.  You need and deserve a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere to do the work you do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As irksome as you may find the content of Mr. Religious Right Reactionary’s opinions, that is not the issue. He certainly has the right to express his views, but he does not have the right to disturb his neighbors at work. It would be completely legitimate for you to try to quiet the irritating chatter from the next cubicle, but exactly how you do that is very important. Revealing that you are an atheist would not be a good idea at this time and place. I’ll speak to that issue later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big mouth bugs you for two reasons: his political-religious views are noxious, and his constant tirades disrupt your ability to work.  Although the first reason is probably the foremost in your mind, the second reason is the one that you should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you begin to make polite requests to your coworker to quiet down &lt;b&gt;always for work-related reasons.&lt;/b&gt; Say with a calm, flat tone, “Excuse me, I need to concentrate on my work.” or “Sorry, I gotta get back to work.” or “Can you please keep it down? I’m trying to work.” This will probably have to be repeated many times. Be patient and think of it as a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume and tone of your voice must remain low and calm, unchanging every time, so practice before you speak to him.  It’s important to keep any hint of irritation out of it, because that will only provoke him. He’s looking for a challenge or even a fight, and you don’t want to feed him that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t touch the subject of his rants with a ten-foot pole. If he or your boss asks you if the specifics of your coworker’s opinions are what you object to, don’t answer that directly, just stick to you how you need to have a peaceful, quiet work environment. You just want him to stop his distracting prattling, period.  Always attaching the need to do your work to your requests for him to be quiet makes your requests unassailable in that office. You’re there to work, not to discuss politics, religion, baseball or somebody’s gall bladder surgery.  Even your two Bible-brandishing bosses couldn’t argue with that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to HR should be the last resort, but prepare for it from the beginning. Keep a written record of the dates and times that he was disturbing your work, and the exact wording of the work-related polite requests for quiet that you made each time. This will simply help you to see if you’ve given it a fair enough time to have an effect, and if as a last remedy you decide to go to HR, you’ll have documentation that you have tried your best in a reasonable manner to get him to stop. Whether to him or to HR, always emphasize the disruption of your work, NOT the content of his tiresome twaddle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it finally has to go to HR, even though you will have taken all the reasonable steps and followed the proper channels, be ready for the poop to hit the propeller.  If he wants to play the oppressed martyr, he will. His remarks may become more passive-aggressive, with sneaky barbs and sideways insults in your direction, or he may actually defiantly escalate his political-religious rants, daring you and HR to stop him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get suckered into reacting to that. He wants that. Calmly and meticulously stick to your original tactic of polite requests for him to not disturb your work.  Keep documenting dates, times and your polite requests, and when it seems like the right time, take it back to HR.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the issue of your atheism and the tension you feel from having to keep your own views carefully concealed. I think that people with jobs should be constantly doing two things: doing their very best at their job, and looking for a better job. Even if the guy shuts up, you’re not working in a comfortable place.  Casually socializing with your fellow workers is a healthy part of work, but being driven into a cubicle-within-a-cubicle, such as with your headphones on and the music up loud, or having to be extremely secretive about your own views is not a healthy way to live.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, daily, start looking around for a better place for you to work and be more free to be yourself. It may take a long time, but just the act of taking assertive steps for benefiting yourself rather than only defending yourself will help you to feel more empowered and in control of your life. &lt;/p&gt;

I was less than impressed with the lack of action taken by Trading Standards and the MHRA.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
I contacted each organisation once more to follow up on my original correspondence. Yet again, Trading Standards have failed to respond - even to acknowledge receipt of my email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA, on the other hand, have not only responded promptly to my follow-up email, but have also said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your message. I can confirm we shall be investigating this complaint and taking any appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA took just one day to respond to my email, and have confirmed that they are at least investigating the complaint and action will be taken, should they deem it appropriate. Trading Standards, meanwhile, are yet to respond to me - having had a week in which to do so. In the four months since I originally contacted them, I haven't had any kind of response whatsoever from Trading Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the email I sent to North Yorkshire County Council:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you with regard to a company based in Skipton and my correspondence with North Yorkshire Trading Standards regarding this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted North Yorkshire Trading Standards in July regarding possible breaches of consumer protection and health and nutrition claims regulations and did not receive a response. I followed up on this 7 days ago, having noted that the website that may breach said regulations remains unaltered. I am yet to receive any kind of response either to the original contact made in July, or to my follow-up email (sent a week ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that North Yorkshire Trading Standards have failed to respond to my emails, neither to inform me of what action (if any) would be taken nor even to acknowledge that they are in receipt of my emails, I thought the best course of action would be to contact North Yorkshire County Council itself and ask for guidance on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company in question is Principle Healthcare Limited, and the address on their website is recorded as being in "Skipton, North Yorkshire" - &lt;a href="http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm" title="http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm"&gt;http://www.principlehealthcare.com/about_us.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours faithfully,&lt;br&gt;
James Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have at least received an automated acknowledgement from North Yorkshire County Council, which is better than North Yorkshire Trading Standards managed. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>James Cole</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.layscience.net/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.layscience.net/rss.xml</id><title type="html">The Lay Scientist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258134629362"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5173671546508929856">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af66a26f84f3dc2b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">timmyme</title><published>2009-11-13T17:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T17:24:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/11/timmy-me.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/Sv2W-VxX0gI/AAAAAAAAKWU/YcrewDAV1IA/s1600-h/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:212px;height:400px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/Sv2W-VxX0gI/AAAAAAAAKWU/YcrewDAV1IA/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ms Sandwalk just got an iPhone.

My Samsung flip phone works just fine, thank-you very much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up until last week, getting an iPhone was the last thing on my mind.

&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 9, &lt;a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/"&gt;the LCROSS spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; watched as a Centaur rocket booster slammed into the south pole of the Moon, hoping to determine if any water ice exists under the lunar surface. The idea is that over millions of years, comet impacts and other events have brought water to the Moon. Most of it goes away over time, but if any water happens to accumulate at the bottoms of craters at the poles, where the Sun never shines, it can stay put, frozen forever in shadow. By impacting a spacecraft into the Moon, it can eject the ice where it gets hit by raw sunlight. The water breaks down into hydrogen and hydroxyl molecules (OH-), which can be directly detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/prelim_water_results.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/lcross_spectra.jpg" alt="lcross_spectra" title="lcross_spectra" width="217" height="329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The target crater, Cabeus, has a temperature on its floor of -230 Celsius, cold enough to store ice. The Centaur slammed into it at high speed, making a new crater about 20 meters across and splashing debris over an even bigger area. A plume went up and out of the crater, and it was that tower of ejected material that had the telltale signs of water. The infrared spectrometer on LCROSS definitely detected absorption lines from water, and the ultraviolet spectrometer saw it in emission. Not only that, the emission got stronger with time, which clinches the deal! That’s exactly what you expect by a plume containing water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of water they found in the plume was a couple of hundred kilograms in total, but that indicates there is a lot more still lying on the surface. They don’t know how much exactly just yet; NASA wanted to release this news as soon as they were sure they had definite results, but there is still much to do. Where did this water come from? How long has it been there? How accessible is it to future astronauts? These questions and more will, hopefully, be answered in the coming weeks and months as the data are analyzed more thoroughly. So stay tuned. There’s lots more good news to come!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258132824338"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10490">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb0ac3c2ca49bea0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="campaign"/><category term="Skepchick Island"/><title type="html">Call to Action: Skepchick Island</title><published>2009-11-13T16:23:47Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T16:23:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/11/skepchick-island/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ed3b633b3ae45bd985c3032e0ea349f0&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Skepchicks need an island. We know it. You know it. In fact, Oprah, Jenny McCarthy and Uri Gellar all know it. Without our island, we lack power… I mean, we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; power, but it’s weakened since it’s diluted across the entire western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, you can help. All we need is money. And you can donate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we launch the campaign to buy Skepchick Island. And here’s the catch: there’s no catch! You can donate as much or as little as you want… but until we raise the entire $50million, you don’t get charged a dime. No one loses! Except Kirk Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? Just pledge your money and your love to our cause!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested donation is $1,000,000 but any amount is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

In regards to their evolutionary past, recent research by Tom Viaene (et al) examined the variability of stamen and petal morphologies within the basal asterid families. Through comparisons of the genes that coded for these floral structures, he determined that the early members of the asterid group likely duplicated the petal and stamen genes as a strategy for moving into a wider range of niches.

Ironically, though, I’m going to argue that blogging is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the best or most effective form of existing science communication online, for many of the reasons outlined in &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;. But trying to be positive rather than negative, I’m also going to point out what &lt;em&gt;is: &lt;/em&gt;Viral YouTube videos that introduce nonscientific audiences, in the millions, to scientific thinking in a very thoughtful and memorable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the best examples of such videos? Well, I’m open to suggestions, but I see two particularly outstanding cases out there. In first place, viewed by over 5 million people, is the hilarious “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50ZssEojtM"&gt;Large Hadron Rap&lt;/a&gt;,” probably the best PR move CERN ever made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/j50ZssEojtM%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In second place, meanwhile, I’d highlight Oregon high school teacher Greg Craven’s “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zORv8wwiadQ"&gt;The Most Terrifying Video You’ll Ever See&lt;/a&gt;,” explaining in a truly convincing fashion that whether or not you believe global warming is caused by humans, logic still compels you to support the need to take action. This one clocks in at well over 2 million views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zORv8wwiadQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, these videos are by far the best examples of using new media to get the word out about science. What do others think, either about the best and most widely watched YouTube vids or other new media innovations? And does anyone want to argue back with the case for blogs?&lt;/p&gt;

Charla Nash was nearly killed by Travis and now has life changing wounds to her face while Travis was stabbed by his owner with a butcher knife and shot dead by the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this incidence preventable or just a freak accident? Should chimpanzees and other primates be kept as pets? What is the effect of the primate pet trade not only on the welfare of these “pets” but on their species survival in the wild? To answer these question I consider what science has to say and draw on both my own work on domestication and over 50 years of research by primatologists on wild chimpanzees.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domesticated animals are biologically different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most people keep domesticated animals, whether it’s a dog, cat or a cow. We know the biological systems in their bodies that control stress responses are down regulated relative to wild animals. This means that the average dog, cat, cow, etc. stays much more calm in a stressful situation than a wolf, lion or buffalo in the same situation. Because domesticated animals do not become as stressed, they rarely if ever attack humans compared to wild animals. It’s true that 23 Americans died last year from dog bites, but this statistic would be many times higher if the 68 million dog owners had wolves instead. By living together with us for thousands of years domesticated animals have been bred to live together with humans relatively harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Domestication is the process of breeding out aggression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chimpanzees are not domesticated animals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although chimpanzees share more DNA in common with humans than they do with gorillas, they are not domesticated animals. So while a tiny percentage of pet dogs will bite a human,- all chimpanzees and all primates will readily bite a human. Moreover, chimpanzees in captivity can weigh between 150-220 pounds, live for over 60 years, and grow to be many times stronger than any human. In the wild, chimpanzees spend a lot of time defending their social status – they often seriously injure each other in fights (biting off fingers, testicles, face tissue, etc) and are known to occasionally hunt and kill rivals and their infants. After 50 years of research on wild chimpanzees we now know that, like people, while they are extremely social and prefer peace they can also be extremely violent – sometimes leading to murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Wild chimpanzees kill each other…it is in their nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do people think chimps make good pets? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Baby chimpanzees look a lot like human babies. They have fingers and toes, and they laugh and pout- they are adorable. People who sell chimpanzees as pets sell babies because no one would ever buy a 200 pound adult chimpanzee. Travis was bought as a baby from a group of trainers who used infant chimpanzees in TV commercials and in children’s birthday parties. Chimpanzee breeders are in the business of selling chimpanzees (~$50,000 each) not educating their customers about the hazards of pet ownership. In addition, Hollywood hires infant chimpanzees to star in movies that show them as cute human imitations. Currently, there are over 700 pet chimpanzees in US homes of unknown origin (i.e. they may be smuggled from Africa). Many of these chimp live decades in horrible conditions and present a real risk to neighbors. ALL primates potentially carry diseases deadly to humans including Herpes B, Yellow Fever, Monkeypox, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, SIV, HIV and tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Breeders and hollywood portray infant chimpanzees as suitable pets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What laws exist to protect the public from the hazards of pet primates? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Currently there are no federal laws in the United States or Europe preventing&lt;br&gt;
the sale or purchase of a chimpanzee or other great apes born outside of Africa&lt;br&gt;
after 1976. There are state laws in the U.S. preventing the sale of&lt;br&gt;
primates such as chimpanzees but many loop holes exist in almost every&lt;br&gt;
state. Chances are, your neighbor can legally own a pet chimpanzee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: No federal law prevents the sale or purchase of chimpanzees in U.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What message do U.S. chimpanzee pet owners send to Africa? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chimpanzees live in tropical forest in over a dozen African countries. It is illegal to own, purchase or sell a chimpanzee in all of these countries. Unfortunately, an international trade rages in Africa – including the sale of great apes like chimpanzees. Hunters shoot mothers and sell their bodies as meat to rich city dwellers who can afford the luxury. They pull babies off the backs of their dead mothers to sell in the markets as pets. These pet traders are doing nothing worse than what is done in the United States legally: baby chimpanzees are pulled off their mothers backs and sold as pets. I have had Africans who have seen U.S. television shows with Hollywood chimpanzees dressed in clothing ask me why people in the U.S. can have chimpanzees&lt;br&gt;
as pets while someone in Africa cannot….they wonder why chimpanzees in the United States are not protected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: U.S. Pet Chimpanzees seem hypocritical to Africans who know they need protection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In an &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/06/sick-and-twisted-belief-a-letter-from-hell/"&gt;earlier post here on FriendlyAtheist&lt;/a&gt;, I said that we’re not fighting against religious people, we’re fighting against the harmful memes that are infecting our society.  Following the metaphor, critical thinking skills of various kinds build up a strong immune system against these mind viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started musing further in &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/11/12/satire-as-a-vaccine-against-our-true-enemies/"&gt;a post on UnreasonableFaith&lt;/a&gt;.   Perhaps we can push the metaphor further: &lt;strong&gt;is satire a vaccine against mind viruses?&lt;/strong&gt; Satire introduces a mostly harmless variation of craziness such that we can recognize the similarities in other forms of idiocy and resist them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satire has to be close enough to the real argument to be recognizable, obviously.  Jon Stewart’s recent parody of Glenn Beck is a prefect example.  The impersonation was definitely recognizable and Stewart exposed the faulty logical leaps and techniques that Beck is known to employ.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some mind viruses are difficult to vaccinate against – we have trouble finding satire that doesn’t trigger the harmful effects in some people.  For example, it can be too difficult to tell the difference between a satirist and a fundamentalist believer (see &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Poe%27s+Law"&gt;Poe’s Law&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far can we push the metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the hypothetical situation: you know the whereabouts of a family of Jews hiding from the Nazis. A Nazi patrol comes up to you and asks where they are; you, a good God-fearing Christian, can either lie and say you don't know (which would be bad, because, like, lying is a sin), or you could tell the truth, and the Nazis would zip off and search for and presumably execute the family. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a non-Bible believing amoral godless atheist, my first thought was that this is trivial: you lie your pants off. The 'crime' of telling a lie pales into insignificance against the crime of enabling the death of fellow human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bodie Hodge of AiG, though, I'm wrong. The good Christian should reject lies, Satan's tools, in all circumstances, and should immediately 'fess up the location of the Jews. He backs it up with Bible quotes, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we love God, we should obey Him (John 14:15). To love God first means to obey Him first--before looking at our neighbor. So, is the greater good trusting God when He says not to lie or trusting in our fallible, sinful minds about the uncertain future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Consider this carefully. In the situation of a Nazi beating on the door, we have assumed a lie would save a life, but really we don't know. So, one would be opting to lie and disobey God without the certainty of saving a life--keeping in mind that all are ultimately condemned to die physically. Besides, whether one lied or not may not have stopped the Nazi solders from searching the house anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As Christians, we need to keep in mind that Jesus Christ reigns. All authority has been given to Him (Matthew 28:18), and He sits on the throne of God at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33; Hebrews 8:1). Nothing can happen without His say. Even Satan could not touch Peter without Christ's approval (Luke 22:31). Regardless, if one were to lie or not, Jesus Christ is in control of timing every person's life and able to discern our motives. It is not for us to worry over what might become, but rather to place our faith and obedience in Christ and to let Him do the reigning. For we do not know the future, whereas God has been telling the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh. I never thought of it that way. So…all those Christians who sheltered Jews during WWII are actually burning in hell right now for their sinful wickedness? That is so counterintuitive, it must be true!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/a_moral_conundrum_resolved_wit.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/GltXSjTmJQM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258130597891"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/11/one_more_for_the_ayn_rand_depr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7063b0f43d6e160c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ayn Rand Deprogrammer"/><title type="html">One More for the Ayn Rand Deprogrammer</title><published>2009-11-13T16:24:37Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T16:24:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/b7luw8F5aNc/one_more_for_the_ayn_rand_depr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/11/one_more_for_the_ayn_rand_depr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/200911/ayn-rand-dick-books-fountainhead?printable=true"&gt;The Bitch is Back&lt;/a&gt;, by Andrew Corsello: "2009's most influential author is a mirthless Russian-American who loves money, hates God, and swings a gigantic dick.

One of the worst examples of this right now surrounds Project Karsei, an expedition to the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" or the "Pacific Trash Vortex," the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;uncritical reporting of which&lt;/a&gt; tends to be riddled with questionable science and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the experience of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;other writers tackling this subject&lt;/a&gt;, I'm probably going to get some flak for this, so I'll metaphorically duck behind senior Greenpeace scientist David Santillo, &lt;a href="http://earthhopenetwork.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=2085"&gt;who has said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with superlative statements that this is somehow a huge floating mass of plastic is that they inevitably lead to desensitizing people when they learn the truth of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the superlatives come thick and fast. The &lt;a href="http://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/project.html"&gt;Ocean Voyages Institute ludicrously&lt;/a&gt; talk with almost religious fervour of...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the plastics which are converging in the Pacific ocean and forming an 8th continent. Never heard of it? You need to help us. This is a rescue mission designed to save the Pacific by mining plastic. This 8th Continent has been identified northeast of Hawaii in the Pacific. Sailors and scientists, fishers and individuals have watched with horror, as this new continent comprised of human discards, primarily plastic garbage, has grown and expanded exponentially over the last few years. Also called the plastic vortex, this 8th continent is currently twice the size of Texas and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalist &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidsuzuki.org%2Fabout_us%2FDr_David_Suzuki%2FArticle_Archives%2Fweekly05160801.asp&amp;amp;ei=p1_9StLgLYf34AbMr_zODA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGfV08gt4sy4zRFgScEaaNxNtEVZA&amp;amp;sig2=sp5DdMwxEULXhjAMvwfrfQ"&gt;David Suzuki talks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;"a massive, expanding island of plastic debris 30 metres deep and bigger than the province of Quebec"&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution"&gt;Greenpeace themselves&lt;/a&gt; - no stranger to exaggeration - describe &lt;em&gt;"one of the world’s largest floating garbage dumps."&lt;/em&gt; Newspaper reports sourced talk of there being six-to-eight times &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12985637?nclick_check=1"&gt;more plastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123793936249132307.html"&gt;than plankton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these claims are obviously absurd - an 8th continent?! - but &lt;a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2009/11/12/thoughts-on-trash-talk/"&gt;as John Zhu has eloquently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, journalists reporting on the "trash vortex" have failed to really challenge the people they're reporting on, or draw on research to add context to their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, a debate has sprung up recently around the reporting of &lt;a href="http://spot.us/stories/252-dissecting-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch"&gt;Lindsay Hoshaw&lt;/a&gt;, a Spot.us community-sponsored journalist whose report on Project Karsei - an environmentalist research project sailing in the region - ended up in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spot.us community paid Lindsay Hoshaw $10,000 to visit the region, but appear to have received little in the way of incisive journalism for their money, with the result coming across as a fairly uncritical travel blog (an excellent criticism of which can be &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/trash_compactor.php?page=all"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;). Should they have sent her in the first place? Zhu makes the following excellent point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe instead of paying for someone to go take pictures of the patch, that $10,000 should go to paying for a reporter to sit in a room somewhere, sift through reams of research data on the subject, visit fisheries, interview scientists, doctors, policy makers … It’s not as exciting as a trip to the garbage patch and certainly lacks that “once-in-a-lifetime” appeal, but it may be the better route toward actually getting good journalism on the subject."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me neatly to the science itself. I'm not an ocean scientist, but I do have some experience of ocean modelling, and many of the claims being made ring alarm bells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the comparison with plankton first. When somebody makes the claim that there is x times more plastic than plankton, the obvious first question any journalist should ask is "well how much plankton is there?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows concentrations of Chlorophyll A in the ocean, measured by satellite, the level of which corresponds to the amount of plankton in the water (through Ocean Color algorithms beyond the scope of this blog post). Below it I've reproduced the colour scale, courtesy of NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chlorophyll A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/chloro_0.jpg" width="460"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/CHLO_colorscale.png" width="360"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to know is that the purplest areas have 0.01mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of chl-A, while the green areas have 1mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the reddest areas have about 50-60mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, some areas of the central Pacific have almost &lt;em&gt;100x&lt;/em&gt; less plankton than, say, the North Atlantic does, and as much as &lt;em&gt;5,000x&lt;/em&gt; less than parts of the Baltic sea or English channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plankton don't generally live in great quantities inthe middle of oceans, so saying that there are 'x' lbs of plastic vs 'x' lbs of plankton is a bit like seeing a washing machine dumped in the middle of the Sahara and returning home to announce that washing machine parts outnumber grass in parts of the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sod-all plankton in the mid-Pacific, and six times sod-all is still sod-all, a point starkly made by Greenpeace's own data, when they compile a table of the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/raw/content/en/documents-reports/plastic_ocean_report.pdf"&gt;relative plastic content of the world's seas and oceans (Figure 4.15, on P30)&lt;/a&gt; (HT: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;Science Punk&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/greenpeace_table.JPG" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that these are figures from visual inspection, and the amount of plastic that can be caught by nets may be far higher, but the point remains that there are other places with a far greater quantity of surface plastic than the North Pacific, making it frankly puzzling just so much attention has been devoted to surface plastic in this area. Indeed, we can look at lot closer to home, at the English Channel, to find a far more concerning levels of contamination that are orders of magnitude higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that regions of high plastic contamination don't exist in the Pacific. Indeed, the NOAA describe &lt;a href="http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html#2"&gt;two areas in the pacific&lt;/a&gt;, the North Pacific Subtropical High and the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ) (media reports generally refer to the former). The size of these areas though is highly variable, and unknown, meaning that guesstimates by activists should be taken with a pinch of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not at all clear that these patches are growing, and Hoshaw's assertion that the Texas-sized trash vortex &lt;em&gt;"doubles in size every decade"&lt;/em&gt; is at best unevidenced and at worst made-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Atlantic, attempts to measure growth have been inconclusive. The &lt;a href="http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/06/18/the-pacific-isnt-the-only-ocean-collecting-plastic-trash/"&gt;Sea Education Association have got 22 years' worth of data on the North Atlantic and Carribean&lt;/a&gt;, centering on a high plastic concentration at about thirty degrees north. The interesting thing from their data is that the quantity of plastic found hasn't increased in the 22 years they've been measuring it. That doesn't mean there isn't more there somewhere, but certainly something curious is happening to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers with that group describe the phenomenon as a "plastic soup", a much more appropriate description and in some ways more alarming: &lt;em&gt;"It’s much worse.  If it were an island, we could go get it. But we can’t, because it’s a thin soup of plastic fragments."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/adam-pasick/files/2009/10/1255628165.jpg" width="250" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the effects of the plastic on life are not as clear-cut as reports would suggest. We know that many animals ingest small particles of plastic, but the end result of this is unclear and probably depends on the species. It is easy to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution.pdf"&gt;post a photo of a dead chick with plastic in its stomach&lt;/a&gt;, and claim that the plastic was the cause of death; but far harder to back this up with evidence. Indeed, studies of albatross chick mortality in Hawaii in the late-1980s found &lt;a href="http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/329"&gt;no evidence of plastic related mortality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's additionally worth bearing in mind the vagueness about where these photos were taken, and the lack of experimental rigour in surveying contents by taking random photos. Personally I do believe plastic is likely to poison or kill some life, but we need more information about the precise extent. As shocking as these images are, they add little to our scientific knowledge of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to cover this problem without being accused of anti-environmentalism. That simply isn't the case - plastic contamination in the oceans simply shouldn't be there, and there's no doubt that this is a problem that needs to be taken seriously. However, by attempting to spin tales of plastic "continents", environmentalists risk shooting themselves in the foot. People have little patience for such easily debunked claims, and there's a real danger of being the boy who cried wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need aren't publicity stunts and travel blogs, but comprehensive research to understand the true extent of the problem, and what we can do about it. Feeding myths to the media doesn't aid this understanding, it simply misleads the public, and ultimately undermines those of us trying to pitch a rational, environmentalist message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to invent an eighth continent to persuade people that plastic in the oceans is a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, nobody likes a cluttered slide.  In science lectures it’s much better to show a single plot augmented with a verrrry limited amount of text.  The clarity focuses the student on the most important point, and frees them to actually listen to what you’re saying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s useful for the students to have a more detailed record of what you discussed while explaining the plot.  Yes, they can and should take notes, but there is a natural tendency for students to write down Every. Word. You. Say., since they have no context for prioritizing the importance of the information spewing forth. I prefer to be explicit about what the key points are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My trick for balancing this is using black text on a black background.  The text doesn’t show on the screen, but it does show up when printed as a handout, since the black background defaults back to white.  Thus, you get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="600"&gt;

I’ve loved it since I was a kid. Not just the act itself though but the whole ritual;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the moment you say to yourself “Yup, today is essentially over and I’m going to bed”, the ablutions, slipping under the covers (I like lots of covers), the reading or watching tv, finally giving in and turning onto my stomach and putting my arms under the pillow (yes, I know this is poor sleep posture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drifting-off period can be fun too. Sometimes I hear noises that I know are just audio hallucinations. These are a form of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/hypnagogic.html"&gt;hypnagogia&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon all skeptics should be familiar with. To reproduce this, think of your name over and over as you go to sleep. I bet you’ll hear it as if someone was saying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your body twitches when you drift-off. This is called a hypnic jerk. This is still a puzzling phenomenon but some experts think it results from the transition of your muscles to a fully relaxed state. Perhaps the brain interprets this as falling so it causes the body to thrash about in an attempt to grab something or to right itself………silly brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="robotdreams" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/robotdreams.jpg" alt="robotdreams" width="384" height="307"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course come the glorious dreams. How weird that we must enter such a bizarre state of consciousness for a third of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had a problem sleeping or going to sleep. My mother and brother Jay though have huge sleeping problems. A full, restive, drug-free night’s rest is a dim memory. I feel very bad for them and I’m also very nervous that at some point I’ll start having similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny, because as much as I love sleep, I’d also love to do away with it. What a massive waste of time it is. If you live to be 100, then you’ll have spent at least 30 years unconscious to the world, cycling between the nothingness of non-rem, non-dreaming to a bizarre dreaming awareness in which we are so out-of-it that a pink unicorn at the quickie-mart seems normal to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what I could have accomplished in that 30 years??? I could have earned multiple PHDs, read more books, spent more time watching my daughter grow-up, watched more QVC. For this reason, I think we’ll eventually obviate sleep, or at least minimize it. It seems to me that completely removing sleep would be horrifically difficult to pull off. I remember one scientist describing this as requiring a reorganization of the brain itself to pull it off. All mammals sleep after all.  This behavior is intimately interwoven into our physiology. I do believe however, that one day we’ll have the knowledge, technology, and desire to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, minimizing sleep would be a best of both worlds scenario to me. There are people after all that get by just fine with absurdly low sleep requirements. It seems reasonable to me then that we could eventually shrink the requirement of sleep from 7 to 10 hours a day to perhaps 2 or 3. That way, I still get my beloved sleep rituals and dreams but I also don’t waste a third of the rest of my life prone with unicorns in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a sleep fan like me then I recommend an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/health/10mind.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I just read. It describes dreaming not as an altered form of consciousness but as consciousness itself absent any information from the senses.  Harvard sleep researcher, Dr. J. Allan Hobson believes that the brain is essentially “warming its circuits” at night in anticipation of the panoply of information and emotions wakefulness will bring. When we are awake then we are in some sense still dreaming but our mind adapts the dream images to what we see and hear. I’m not sure what to make of this yet but it’s an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258127036359"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=7373">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/038df8d36ebc39c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Geekery"/><category term="geeks"/><category term="Jim Kakalios"/><category term="nerds"/><category term="Watchmen"/><title type="html">Nerds run this planet</title><published>2009-11-13T15:00:40Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T15:00:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/N7uTIMV_VXQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/13/nerds-run-this-planet/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jim Kakalios was the science advisor for the Watchmen movie, and wrote a book called &lt;a href="http://www.physicsofsuperheroes.com/"&gt;The Physics of Superheroes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;He’s also a funny one, and a canny one. He was asked to give &lt;a href="http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/undergrad/2009kakalios.html"&gt;the 2009 convocation address at the University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, the video is not embeddable, so go there and watch it), and he talked about geeks and nerds.

One of the worst examples of this right now surrounds Project Karsei, an expedition to the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" or the "Pacific Trash Vortex," the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;uncritical reporting of which&lt;/a&gt; tends to be riddled with questionable science and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the experience of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;other writers tackling this subject&lt;/a&gt;, I'm probably going to get some flak for this, so I'll metaphorically duck behind senior Greenpeace scientist David Santillo, &lt;a href="http://earthhopenetwork.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=2085"&gt;who has said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with superlative statements that this is somehow a huge floating mass of plastic is that they inevitably lead to desensitizing people when they learn the truth of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the superlatives come thick and fast. The &lt;a href="http://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/project.html"&gt;Ocean Voyages Institute ludicrously&lt;/a&gt; talk with almost religious fervour of...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the plastics which are converging in the Pacific ocean and forming an 8th continent. Never heard of it? You need to help us. This is a rescue mission designed to save the Pacific by mining plastic. This 8th Continent has been identified northeast of Hawaii in the Pacific. Sailors and scientists, fishers and individuals have watched with horror, as this new continent comprised of human discards, primarily plastic garbage, has grown and expanded exponentially over the last few years. Also called the plastic vortex, this 8th continent is currently twice the size of Texas and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalist &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidsuzuki.org%2Fabout_us%2FDr_David_Suzuki%2FArticle_Archives%2Fweekly05160801.asp&amp;amp;ei=p1_9StLgLYf34AbMr_zODA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGfV08gt4sy4zRFgScEaaNxNtEVZA&amp;amp;sig2=sp5DdMwxEULXhjAMvwfrfQ"&gt;David Suzuki talks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;"a massive, expanding island of plastic debris 30 metres deep and bigger than the province of Quebec"&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution"&gt;Greenpeace themselves&lt;/a&gt; - no stranger to exaggeration - describe &lt;em&gt;"one of the world’s largest floating garbage dumps."&lt;/em&gt; Newspaper reports sourced talk of there being six-to-eight times &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12985637?nclick_check=1"&gt;more plastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123793936249132307.html"&gt;than plankton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these claims are obviously absurd - an 8th continent?! - but &lt;a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2009/11/12/thoughts-on-trash-talk/"&gt;as John Zhu has eloquently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, journalists reporting on the "trash vortex" have failed to really challenge the people they're reporting on, or draw on research to add context to their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, a debate has sprung up recently around the reporting of &lt;a href="http://spot.us/stories/252-dissecting-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch"&gt;Lindsay Hoshaw&lt;/a&gt;, a Spot.us community-sponsored journalist whose report on Project Karsei - an environmentalist research project sailing in the region - ended up in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spot.us community paid Lindsay Hoshaw $10,000 to visit the region, but appear to have received little in the way of incisive journalism for their money, with the result coming across as a fairly uncritical travel blog (an excellent criticism of which can be &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/trash_compactor.php?page=all"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/#comment-621"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Should they have sent her in the first place? Zhu makes the following excellent point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe instead of paying for someone to go take pictures of the patch, that $10,000 should go to paying for a reporter to sit in a room somewhere, sift through reams of research data on the subject, visit fisheries, interview scientists, doctors, policy makers … It’s not as exciting as a trip to the garbage patch and certainly lacks that “once-in-a-lifetime” appeal, but it may be the better route toward actually getting good journalism on the subject."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me neatly to the science itself. I'm not an ocean scientist, but I do have some experience of ocean modelling, and many of the claims being made ring alarm bells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the comparison with plankton first. When somebody makes the claim that there is x times more plastic than plankton, the obvious first question any journalist should ask is "well how much plankton is there?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows concentrations of Chlorophyll A in the ocean, measured by satellite, the level of which can be used as a proxy for the amount of plankton in the water (through Ocean Color algorithms beyond the scope of this blog post). Below it I've reproduced the colour scale, courtesy of NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chlorophyll A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/chloro_0.jpg" width="460"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/CHLO_colorscale.png" width="360"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to know is that the purplest areas have 0.01mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of chl-A, while the green areas have 1mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the reddest areas have about 50-60mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, some areas of the central Pacific have almost &lt;em&gt;100x&lt;/em&gt; less plankton than, say, the North Atlantic does, and as much as &lt;em&gt;5,000x&lt;/em&gt; less than parts of the Baltic sea or English channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plankton don't generally live in great quantities inthe middle of oceans, so saying that there are 'x' lbs of plastic vs 'x' lbs of plankton is a bit like seeing a washing machine dumped in the middle of the Sahara and returning home to announce that washing machine parts outnumber grass in parts of the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are (comparatively) sod-all plankton in the mid-Pacific, and six times sod-all is still sod-all, a point starkly made by Greenpeace's own data, when they compile a table of the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/raw/content/en/documents-reports/plastic_ocean_report.pdf"&gt;relative plastic content of the world's seas and oceans (Figure 4.15, on P30)&lt;/a&gt; (HT: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;Science Punk&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/greenpeace_table.JPG" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that these are figures from visual inspection, and the amount of plastic that can be caught by nets may be far higher, but the point remains that there are other places with a far greater quantity of surface plastic than the North Pacific, making it frankly puzzling that just so much attention has been devoted to surface plastic in this area. Indeed, we can look at lot closer to home, at the English Channel, to find far more concerning levels of contamination that are orders of magnitude higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that regions of high plastic contamination don't exist in the Pacific. Indeed, the NOAA describe &lt;a href="http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html#2"&gt;two areas in the pacific&lt;/a&gt;, the North Pacific Subtropical High and the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ) (media reports generally refer to the former). The size of these areas though is highly variable, and unknown, meaning that guesstimates by activists should be taken with a pinch of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not at all clear that these patches are growing, and Hoshaw's assertion that the Texas-sized trash vortex &lt;em&gt;"doubles in size every decade"&lt;/em&gt; is at best unevidenced and at worst made-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Atlantic, attempts to measure growth have been inconclusive. The &lt;a href="http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/06/18/the-pacific-isnt-the-only-ocean-collecting-plastic-trash/"&gt;Sea Education Association have got 22 years' worth of data on the North Atlantic and Carribean&lt;/a&gt;, centering on a high plastic concentration at about thirty degrees north. The interesting thing from their data is that the quantity of plastic found hasn't increased in the 22 years they've been measuring it. That doesn't mean there isn't more there somewhere, but certainly something curious is happening to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers with that group describe the phenomenon as a "plastic soup", a much more appropriate description and in some ways more alarming: &lt;em&gt;"It’s much worse.  If it were an island, we could go get it. But we can’t, because it’s a thin soup of plastic fragments."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/adam-pasick/files/2009/10/1255628165.jpg" width="250" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the effects of the plastic on life are not as clear-cut as reports would suggest. We know that many animals ingest small particles of plastic, but the end result of this is unclear and probably depends on the species. It is easy to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution.pdf"&gt;post a photo of a dead chick with plastic in its stomach&lt;/a&gt;, and claim that the plastic was the cause of death; but far harder to back this up with evidence. Indeed, studies of albatross chick mortality in Hawaii in the late-1980s found &lt;a href="http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/329"&gt;no evidence of plastic related mortality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's additionally worth bearing in mind the vagueness about where these photos were taken, and the lack of experimental rigour inherent in surveying contents by taking random photos. Personally I do believe plastic is likely to poison or kill some life, but we need more information about the precise extent. As shocking as these images are, they add little to our scientific knowledge of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to cover this problem without being accused of anti-environmentalism. That isn't the case - plastic contamination in the oceans simply shouldn't be there, and there's no doubt that this is a problem that needs to be taken seriously. However, by attempting to spin tales of plastic "continents", environmentalists risk shooting themselves in the foot. People have little patience for such easily debunked claims, and there's a real danger of being the boy who cried wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need aren't publicity stunts and travel blogs, but comprehensive research to understand the true extent of the problem, and what we can do about it. Feeding myths to the media doesn't aid this understanding, it simply misleads the public, and ultimately undermines those of us trying to pitch a rational, environmentalist message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to invent an eighth continent to persuade people that plastic in the oceans is a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the experience of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;other writers tackling this subject&lt;/a&gt;, I'm probably going to get some flak for this, so I'll metaphorically duck behind senior Greenpeace scientist David Santillo, &lt;a href="http://earthhopenetwork.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=2085"&gt;who has said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with superlative statements that this is somehow a huge floating mass of plastic is that they inevitably lead to desensitizing people when they learn the truth of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the superlatives come thick and fast. The &lt;a href="http://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/project.html"&gt;Ocean Voyages Institute ludicrously&lt;/a&gt; talk with almost religious fervour of...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the plastics which are converging in the Pacific ocean and forming an 8th continent. Never heard of it? You need to help us. This is a rescue mission designed to save the Pacific by mining plastic. This 8th Continent has been identified northeast of Hawaii in the Pacific. Sailors and scientists, fishers and individuals have watched with horror, as this new continent comprised of human discards, primarily plastic garbage, has grown and expanded exponentially over the last few years. Also called the plastic vortex, this 8th continent is currently twice the size of Texas and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalist &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidsuzuki.org%2Fabout_us%2FDr_David_Suzuki%2FArticle_Archives%2Fweekly05160801.asp&amp;amp;ei=p1_9StLgLYf34AbMr_zODA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGfV08gt4sy4zRFgScEaaNxNtEVZA&amp;amp;sig2=sp5DdMwxEULXhjAMvwfrfQ"&gt;David Suzuki talks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;"a massive, expanding island of plastic debris 30 metres deep and bigger than the province of Quebec"&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution"&gt;Greenpeace themselves&lt;/a&gt; - no stranger to exaggeration - describe &lt;em&gt;"one of the world’s largest floating garbage dumps."&lt;/em&gt; Newspaper reports sourced talk of there being six-to-eight times &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12985637?nclick_check=1"&gt;more plastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123793936249132307.html"&gt;than plankton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these claims are obviously absurd - an 8th continent?! - but &lt;a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2009/11/12/thoughts-on-trash-talk/"&gt;as John Zhu has eloquently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, journalists reporting on the "trash vortex" have failed to really challenge the people they're reporting on, or draw on research to add context to their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, a debate has sprung up recently around the reporting of &lt;a href="http://spot.us/stories/252-dissecting-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch"&gt;Lindsay Hoshaw&lt;/a&gt;, a Spot.us community-sponsored journalist whose report on Project Karsei - an environmentalist research project sailing in the region - ended up in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10patch.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=science"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spot.us community paid Lindsay Hoshaw $10,000 to visit the region, but appear to have received little in the way of incisive journalism for their money, with the result coming across as a fairly uncritical travel blog (an excellent criticism of which can be &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/trash_compactor.php?page=all"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://seaplexscience.com/2009/11/13/millions-billions-trillions-of-scientific-errors-in-the-nyt/#comment-621"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Should they have sent her in the first place? Zhu makes the following excellent point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe instead of paying for someone to go take pictures of the patch, that $10,000 should go to paying for a reporter to sit in a room somewhere, sift through reams of research data on the subject, visit fisheries, interview scientists, doctors, policy makers … It’s not as exciting as a trip to the garbage patch and certainly lacks that “once-in-a-lifetime” appeal, but it may be the better route toward actually getting good journalism on the subject."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me neatly to the science itself. I'm not an ocean scientist, but I do have some experience of ocean modelling, and many of the claims being made ring alarm bells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the comparison with plankton first. When somebody makes the claim that there is x times more plastic than plankton, the obvious first question any journalist should ask is "well how much plankton is there?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows concentrations of Chlorophyll A in the ocean, measured by satellite, the level of which can be used as a proxy for the amount of plankton in the water (through Ocean Color algorithms beyond the scope of this blog post). Below it I've reproduced the colour scale, courtesy of NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chlorophyll A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/chloro_0.jpg" width="460"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/CHLO_colorscale.png" width="360"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to know is that the purplest areas have 0.01mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of chl-A, while the green areas have 1mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the reddest areas have about 50-60mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, some areas of the central Pacific have almost &lt;em&gt;100x&lt;/em&gt; less plankton than, say, the North Atlantic does, and as much as &lt;em&gt;5,000x&lt;/em&gt; less than parts of the Baltic sea or English channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plankton don't generally live in great quantities inthe middle of oceans, so saying that there are 'x' lbs of plastic vs 'x' lbs of plankton is a bit like seeing a washing machine dumped in the middle of the Sahara and returning home to announce that washing machine parts outnumber grass in parts of the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are (comparatively) sod-all plankton in the mid-Pacific, and six times sod-all is still sod-all, a point starkly made by Greenpeace's own data, when they compile a table of the &lt;a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/raw/content/en/documents-reports/plastic_ocean_report.pdf"&gt;relative plastic content of the world's seas and oceans (Figure 4.15, on P30)&lt;/a&gt; (HT: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/2006/11/the-red-herrings-of-greenpeace/"&gt;Science Punk&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/gallery/greenpeace_table.JPG" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that these are figures from visual inspection, and the amount of plastic that can be caught by nets may be far higher, but the point remains that there are other places with a far greater quantity of surface plastic than the North Pacific, making it frankly puzzling that just so much attention has been devoted to surface plastic in this area. Indeed, we can look at lot closer to home, at the English Channel, to find far more concerning levels of contamination that are orders of magnitude higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that regions of high plastic contamination don't exist in the Pacific. Indeed, the NOAA describe &lt;a href="http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html#2"&gt;two areas in the pacific&lt;/a&gt;, the North Pacific Subtropical High and the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ) (media reports generally refer to the former). The size of these areas though is highly variable, and unknown, meaning that guesstimates by activists should be taken with a pinch of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not at all clear that these patches are growing, and Hoshaw's assertion that the Texas-sized trash vortex &lt;em&gt;"doubles in size every decade"&lt;/em&gt; is at best unevidenced and at worst made-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Atlantic, attempts to measure growth have been inconclusive. The &lt;a href="http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/06/18/the-pacific-isnt-the-only-ocean-collecting-plastic-trash/"&gt;Sea Education Association have got 22 years' worth of data on the North Atlantic and Carribean&lt;/a&gt;, centering on a high plastic concentration at about thirty degrees north. The interesting thing from their data is that the quantity of plastic found hasn't increased in the 22 years they've been measuring it. That doesn't mean there isn't more there somewhere, but certainly something curious is happening to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers with that group describe the phenomenon as a "plastic soup", a much more appropriate description and in some ways more alarming: &lt;em&gt;"It’s much worse.  If it were an island, we could go get it. But we can’t, because it’s a thin soup of plastic fragments."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/adam-pasick/files/2009/10/1255628165.jpg" width="250" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the effects of the plastic on life are not as clear-cut as reports would suggest. We know that many animals ingest small particles of plastic, but the end result of this is unclear and probably depends on the species. It is easy to &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/plastic-pollution.pdf"&gt;post a photo of a dead chick with plastic in its stomach&lt;/a&gt;, and claim that the plastic was the cause of death; but far harder to back this up with evidence. Indeed, studies of albatross chick mortality in Hawaii in the late-1980s found &lt;a href="http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/329"&gt;no evidence of plastic related mortality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's additionally worth bearing in mind the vagueness about where these photos were taken, and the lack of experimental rigour inherent in surveying contents by taking random photos. Personally I do believe plastic is likely to poison or kill some life, but we need more information about the precise extent. As shocking as these images are, they add little to our scientific knowledge of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to cover this problem without being accused of anti-environmentalism. That isn't the case - plastic contamination in the oceans simply shouldn't be there, and there's no doubt that this is a problem that needs to be taken seriously. However, by attempting to spin tales of plastic "continents", environmentalists risk shooting themselves in the foot. People have little patience for such easily debunked claims, and there's a real danger of being the boy who cried wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need aren't publicity stunts and travel blogs, but comprehensive research to understand the true extent of the problem, and what we can do about it. Feeding myths to the media doesn't aid this understanding, it simply misleads the public, and ultimately undermines those of us trying to pitch a rational, environmentalist message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to invent an eighth continent to persuade people that plastic in the oceans is a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reporting on &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/12/cincinnati-coalition-of-reason-billboard-taken-down-and-put-back-up-after-threat/"&gt;the threats&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in Lamar advertising moving the &lt;a href="http://cincinnati.unitedcor.org/"&gt;Cincinnati Coalition of Reason&lt;/a&gt; billboard, the article first quotes the CinCoR coordinator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Everything that has happened shows just how vital our message is,” Shawn Jeffers, co-coordinator for the Cincinnati Coalition of Reason, said. “It proves our point, that bigotry against people who don’t believe in a god is still very real in America.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then quotes some random voice from the opposition… to keep it fair and balanced, I presume.  Maybe they couldn’t find anyone who had a good reason to oppose the billboard’s message, because they ended up using this guy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jack Jones of Downtown told the TV station he thinks the sign should not be put up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s atheist,” he said.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.  End of quotation, end of story, end of debate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eloquent, reasonable atheist.  Followed by a wingnut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I didn’t know billboards could adopt a faith, but I learned something new today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know, all billboards need to be converted lest they burn in hell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have previously made my own opinions clear,* as have fellow bloggers &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;Gorski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=341"&gt;Novella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;Lipson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;Sampson&lt;/a&gt;: the best strategic plan for the NCCAM would be to extinguish itself. Since politics makes that plan unlikely, there are strategies that could minimize the considerable harm now done by the Center, while possibly offering a modest benefit. In summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For both scientific and ethical reasons the NCCAM must dispense with trials of highly implausible claims. It should start by &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596934?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3"&gt;abandoning&lt;/a&gt; the ongoing Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT), its largest and most expensive trial yet, and one that has proven to place experimental subjects in considerable &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=132"&gt;danger&lt;/a&gt;. It should publicly acknowledge such &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1545"&gt;mistakes&lt;/a&gt; and explain why they must not be repeated—no matter how much political pressure there may be to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center should use its website’s &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/"&gt;Health Information&lt;/a&gt; function to explain what’s known, rather than continue its customary practice of putting the best possible slant on most “CAM” claims, no matter how absurd or disproven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center should address aspects of “CAM” advocacy that it has previously avoided, the most important being the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760163?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3"&gt;close affiliation of such advocacy &lt;/a&gt;with the anti-vaccination (and autism quackery) movement. The NCCAM should consider itself an important source of rational information for a public that is currently, and dangerously, misled about immunizations. A related example of mischievous “CAM” advocacy, so far also ignored by the Center’s website, involves an imagined, sinister cartel of physicians, the AMA, pharmaceutical companies, and the FDA. The NCCAM should vigorously debunk such myths by providing facts and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Center should pursue the question of why some people are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2525"&gt;stubbornly attracted&lt;/a&gt; to implausible, unproven, and/or inert treatments. Wally Sampson suggested this idea years ago. It is one of many legacies of the late Barry Beyerstein, among others, whose &lt;a href="http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt; could serve as a template for legitimate NCCAM research topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCCAM’s Charter and its boosters in Congress make such strategies exceedingly unlikely, as explained &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, in this and two subsequent postings I’ll address a few of the assertions made in each of the Center’s three “big picture” essays. These will not be comprehensive critiques of those essays, which would require deconstructions of nearly every sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Essay #1: &lt;a href="http://plan.nccam.nih.gov/index.cfm?module=paper1"&gt;NCCAM’s Mandate and Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay quotes from the Center’s “legislative mandate”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) The general purposes of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine are the conduct and support of basic and applied research (including both intramural and extramural research), research training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to identifying, investigating, and validating complementary and alternative treatment, diagnostic and prevention modalities, disciplines and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) In carrying out subsection (a), the Director of the Center shall, as appropriate, study the integration of alternative treatment, diagnostic and prevention systems, modalities, and disciplines with the practice of conventional medicine as a complement to such medicine and into health care delivery systems in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words “validating” and “integration” imply that the authors of the 1998 legislation, e.g., Senator &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=Tom+Harkin+and+NCCAM"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt;, were already certain of the value of “CAM” and expected the Center to promote it even prior to the results of investigations. That is exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay attempts to tackle the “definition of CAM”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition of CAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many definitions of CAM have been suggested, but a precise or consensus definition has not emerged. Nonetheless, most definitions share the common themes of 1) broad inclusivity of health practices that emerge outside of or beyond the socially dominant paradigm of health care and 2) indistinct boundaries between CAM and the dominant health care paradigm. Definitions of CAM from several interested organizations are representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NCCAM Web site:&lt;/strong&gt; “CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. Some health care providers practice both CAM and conventional medicine.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, &lt;em&gt;Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;a title="2: footnote link" href="http://plan.nccam.nih.gov/index.cfm?module=paper1#_ftn2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; “A broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries with CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cochrane Collaboration: &lt;/strong&gt;“A broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices, and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. These practices complement mainstream medicine by 1) contributing to a common whole; 2) satisfying a demand not met by conventional practices; and 3) diversifying the conceptual framework of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeated use of the term “socially dominant paradigm of health care” and its variations, not only by the NCCAM but by the reputedly trustworthy IOM and Cochrane Collaboration, is dishonest and disturbing. The implication is that modern medicine became “dominant” not because its marriage with science resulted in unprecedented effectiveness (and the promise of much more), but because of arbitrary “privileging.” This kind of post-modern language distortion has been a staple of NCCAM propaganda since its inception, as previously discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding a concise and accurate definition of “CAM,” &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=62"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one that you’ll not find offered by the NCCAM or any other advocacy organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;A spectrum of implausible beliefs and claims about health and disease. These range from the untestable and absurd to the possible but not very intriguing. In all cases the enthusiasm of advocates vastly exceeds the scientific promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay next discusses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epidemiology of CAM Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHIS data also have provided important insights into reasons for CAM use, which fall into two approximately equal categories 1) treating a variety of health problems—particularly chronic pain and other difficult symptoms and 2) promoting general health and wellness. Much of this use is “self-care” (i.e., not provided or administered by a health care provider). Notably, use of CAM to completely replace effective and safe treatments for serious conditions appears uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the begged questions: NHIS data have provided no insights into the issue addressed in the final bullet at the beginning of this posting. It is reasonable to assume that people who are drawn to implausible or ineffective treatments &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that they work. Insight would come from investigating &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they think so. To the first category—”treating a variety of health problems”—&lt;a href="http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html"&gt;Dr. Beyerstein’s views&lt;/a&gt; are pertinent. Regarding the second, “promoting general health and wellness,” we must invoke an additional &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;Madison Avenue component&lt;/a&gt;, for which the NCCAM is at least as culpable as any other source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Current State of CAM Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade the evidence base regarding efficacy and safety of CAM practices has grown substantially in both quality and quantity. Basic research and clinical trials, both large and small, have yielded results—both “positive” and “negative”—that inform consumers’ use of and health care providers’ recommendations concerning CAM…There is also evidence that this body of research has influenced consumers. For example, both NHIS data and industry sales figures suggest that the results of several large clinical trials have affected both the frequency of use and sales of nonvitamin/nonmineral dietary supplements. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has taken actions to address concerns about the safety of some CAM products as a direct result of CAM research…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no: results have really been only “negative” (remember the NCCAM’s customary practice of putting the best possible slant on most ‘CAM’ claims? We’ll see more of this in subsequent posts). What, though, is the “evidence that this body of research has influenced consumers”? If true it would be a good thing, but I don’t buy it. It’s amusing that the essay credits the beleaguered FDA for trying to put out the same fires that the NCCAM fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although approximately half of CAM use by Americans consists of practices aimed at improving general health, most CAM research to date has focused on the application of CAM practices to the treatment of various diseases and conditions. Better health, wellness, and well-being are terms that allude to a concept important to everyone and are the focus of current debates about the future of health care in America. However, research on interventions aimed at improving general health and well-being presents very significant scientific and logistical challenges, including difficulties defining their meanings and their multi-dimensional and dynamic qualities. In considering future strategic directions for NCCAM and the field of CAM research, it is important to consider carefully the opportunities at hand and the resources and research tools needed to pursue those opportunities. It also is important to consider carefully the role that NCCAM should play in promoting and developing a body of research at NIH regarding this complex arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the begged questions already mentioned, I’m not sure what to make of that paragraph. On the one hand it appears to be a segue to special pleading about designing trials of ‘CAM’ claims for “improving general health”; on the other it may be a preliminary apology, to certain “stakeholders,” for an eventual decision NOT to “develop a body of research at NIH regarding this complex arena.” Here’s hoping for the second interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticisms of CAM Research and NCCAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a spectrum of critical opinion regarding the NCCAM-funded research enterprise. It is important to examine these points of view—which are often contradictory—in considering NCCAM’s mission and its future strategic directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one end of the critical spectrum are claims that CAM approaches are inherently implausible and justified only by “pseudoscience,” that peer-review processes are inferior to those of the rest of NIH and that NCCAM funds proposals of dubious merit, that the field suffers from insularity, that the research agenda is driven by political pressures rather than scientific considerations, and that the research could be better carried out under the aegis of other NIH institutes and centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum are claims that NCCAM research fails to evaluate CAM as it is actually used in “real-world” CAM practice settings, that there is insufficient support of CAM practitioner involvement in the research process, that the field is dominated by reductionist scientific approaches or inappropriate methodology, that the peer-review process is biased against CAM, that most NCCAM research is designed or conducted with a goal of “debunking” or disproving value, and that there has been insufficient focus on health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes: many ‘CAM’ approaches are &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center"&gt;inherently implausible&lt;/a&gt; and justified only by pseudoscience; NCCAM peer-review processes are &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438277/?tool=pubmed#__secid592516"&gt;inferior&lt;/a&gt; to those of the rest of NIH; the NCCAM &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;funds proposals&lt;/a&gt; of dubious merit; the field &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=356"&gt;suffers from insularity&lt;/a&gt;; the ‘CAM’ research agenda at the NIH is driven by &lt;a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/48041725.html?dids=48041725:48041725&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;date=Jan+18%2C+2000&amp;amp;author=Susan+Okie&amp;amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;amp;edition=&amp;amp;startpage=A.01&amp;amp;desc=Maverick+Treatments+Find+U.S.+Funding%3B+Cancer+Therapy+to+Be+Tested+Despite+Mainstream+Medical+Doubts"&gt;political pressures&lt;/a&gt; rather than by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=402"&gt;scientific considerations&lt;/a&gt;; the research could be better carried out under the aegis of other NIH institutes and centers, which usually begin by considering scientific and medical promise rather than ideological correctness, and which are unlikely to hire &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=547"&gt;convicted felons&lt;/a&gt; and other scoundrels as investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such charges do not come from “one end of the critical spectrum.” They come from the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857923?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;amp;ordinalpos=2"&gt;center&lt;/a&gt; of the science-based critical spectrum. Some of them are simple facts, as the linked essays demonstrate. Both the Gonzalez trial and the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy resulted largely from &lt;a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_house_hearings&amp;amp;docid=f:59973.pdf"&gt;pressures&lt;/a&gt; applied by Rep. Dan Burton to the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, shortly before the creation of the NCCAM—which subsequently embraced both trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each trial bypassed the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/policies/clinical-considerations.htm#jump4"&gt;usual preliminary investigations&lt;/a&gt; necessary to justify a Phase III human trial. In the case of the TACT, which the NCCAM shepherded from the &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/rfa_AT-01-004.pdf"&gt;Request for Applications&lt;/a&gt; onward, the Center also contradicted language in its own report, “&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021215053952/http://nccam.nih.gov/research/priorities/index.htm#5"&gt;FY 2003 Research Priorities&lt;/a&gt;” (a precursor to the current “Stategic Plan”):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular diseases&lt;/strong&gt;–Preclinical and early phase studies of approaches to manage hypertension, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, including studies of the biology of EDTA chelation therapy in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That passage was written months before the first (human) TACT subject was infused with disodium EDTA, but there is no evidence that such animal studies were ever done. The TACT peer-review process was further tainted by the presence of a key “stakeholder,” &lt;a href="http://www.healthcelebration.com/Portals/0/Toledo%20Blade-Dr.%20Chappell.pdf"&gt;L. Terry Chappell&lt;/a&gt;, on the pertinent scientific review committee. Chappell was not competent to  review NIH scientific research protocols, as the linked report demonstrates. That his presence was in clear violation of the NIH conflict of interest policy is shown by his having been named as a participant in the TACT, on page 284 of the very &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/tactprotocol_20010829.pdf"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; that he would be reviewing, and by language at the bottom of the &lt;a href="http://www.circare.org/tact/nccamsepZAT1K02_20020104.pdf"&gt;meeting roster&lt;/a&gt; on which his name appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCCAM’s portrayal of such charges as extreme—”one end of [a] critical spectrum” whose “points of view…are often contradictory” (the other end pleading that it isn’t fair to subject ‘CAM’ to scientific scrutiny at all)—seems to call for ‘balance.’ The truth, it implies, must lie somewhere in between. How convenient, and how utterly dishonest. It suggests a twist on a logical fallacy; perhaps we should call it The Fallacy of the Fallacy of the Excluded Middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CAM Research Enterprise and Research Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…CAM research is now a specific focus of several international organizations, including the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=26"&gt;Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research, and the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=193"&gt;Society for Integrative Oncology&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of charting NCCAM’s future strategic directions, it is important to consider the relationship and boundaries between the field of CAM research and the emerging field of “integrative medicine.” A 2005 IOM report on CAM concluded that the goal for integrative medicine should be the provision of comprehensive medical care based on the best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm; that encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options; and that promotes choices in care that can include CAM therapies, when appropriate. In early 2009, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350"&gt;IOM&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;Bravewell Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; described &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;integrative medicine&lt;/a&gt; as “orienting the health care process to engage patients and caregivers in the full range of physical, psychological, social, preventive, and therapeutic factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable overlap between integrative medicine research and CAM research…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well yes, I suppose there is. The deadline for submitting comments to the NCCAM is November 19, 2009. I hope that some of you will offer your opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007828" title=""&gt;Norwegian Physicians' Knowledge of and Opinions about Evidence-Based Medicine: Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer five research questions: Do Norwegian physicians know about the three important aspects of EBM? Do they use EBM methods in their clinical practice? What are their attitudes towards EBM? Has EBM in their opinion changed medical practice during the last 10 years? Do they use EBM based information sources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross sectional survey in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;966 doctors who responded to a questionnaire (70% response rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total 87% of the physicians mentioned the use of randomised clinical trials as a key aspect of EBM, while 53% of them mentioned use of clinical expertise and only 19% patients' values. 40% of the respondents reported that their practice had always been evidence-based. Many respondents experienced difficulties in using EBM principles in their clinical practice because of lack of time and difficulties in searching EBM based literature. 80% agreed that EBM helps physicians towards better practice and 52% that it improves patients' health. As reasons for changes in medical practice 86% of respondents mentioned medical progress, but only 39% EBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the study indicate that Norwegian physicians have a limited knowledge of the key aspects of EBM but a positive attitude towards the concept. They had limited experience in the practice of EBM and were rather indifferent to the impact of EBM on medical practice. For solving a patient problem, physicians would rather consult a colleague than searching evidence based resources such as the Cochrane Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007808" title=""&gt;Campbell's Monkeys Use Affixation to Alter Call Meaning&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human language has evolved on a biological substrate with phylogenetic roots deep in the primate lineage. Here, we describe a functional analogy to a common morphological process in human speech, affixation, in the alarm calls of free-ranging adult Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli campbelli). We found that male alarm calls are composed of an acoustically variable stem, which can be followed by an acoustically invariable suffix. Using long-term observations and predator simulation experiments, we show that suffixation in this species functions to broaden the calls' meaning by transforming a highly specific eagle alarm to a general arboreal disturbance call or by transforming a highly specific leopard alarm call to a general alert call. We concluded that, when referring to specific external events, non-human primates can generate meaningful acoustic variation during call production that is functionally equivalent to suffixation in human language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007802" title=""&gt;Interference Competition and High Temperatures Reduce the Virulence of Fig Wasps and Stabilize a Fig-Wasp Mutualism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007790" title=""&gt;MVA-Based H5N1 Vaccine Affords Cross-Clade Protection in Mice against Influenza A/H5N1 Viruses at Low Doses and after Single Immunization&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype, frequently reported since 2003, result in high morbidity and mortality. It is feared that these viruses become pandemic, therefore the development of safe and effective vaccines is desirable. MVA-based H5N1 vaccines already proved to be effective when two immunizations with high doses were used. Dose-sparing strategies would increase the number of people that can be vaccinated when the amount of vaccine preparations that can be produced is limited. Furthermore, protective immunity is induced ideally after a single immunization. Therefore the minimal requirements for induction of protective immunity with a MVA-based H5N1 vaccine were assessed in mice. To this end, mice were vaccinated once or twice with descending doses of a recombinant MVA expressing the HA gene of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1194/04. The protective efficacy was determined after challenge infection with the homologous clade 1 virus and a heterologous virus derived from clade 2.1, A/Indonesia/5/05 by assessing weight loss, virus replication and histopathological changes. It was concluded that MVA-based vaccines allowed significant dose-sparing and afford cross-clade protection, also after a single immunization, which are favorable properties for an H5N1 vaccine candidate.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/11/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_214.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/zapd1_VNZHY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258123326787"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencetext.com/mobile-malware-epidemic-on-the-way.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4d80903d665ebff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Mobile malware epidemic on the way</title><published>2009-11-13T07:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T07:00:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/zg6qsw1TSlE/mobile-malware-epidemic-on-the-way.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.sciencetext.com/mobile-malware-epidemic-on-the-way.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A mobile malware epidemic could render phone networks useless within two to three years, if public awareness of the issue and network security experts don’t take control out of the hands of hackers.

They plan to push the simple-minded literalist creationist claim that the earth is 6,000 years old and peddle the same BS that the Creation &amp;quot;Museum&amp;quot; does — it&amp;#39;s stark raving mad. These quotes tell the whole story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim, Schultz said, is to provide families and young people with information they can use to respectfully question differing points of view they may encounter, like at school.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"What we're finding is, many kids are subject to ridicule, lower grades, being laughed at, just because they lay forth different arguments and different interpretations of the same information," Schultz said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Rev. George Sagissor, who is working to help create the learning center, said he ran into similar reactions when he attended the University of Minnesota-Morris in the 1960s.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He recalled one lecture when he said he politely raised his hand to ask a question from a creation standpoint and was asked to leave the class.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"We don't get a chance to let our point of view be heard because we're put down and we're asked to shut up," Sagissor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to see that my university has a long tradition of dealing with nonsense appropriately. I&amp;#39;m sure that creations was polite in his questions, but I&amp;#39;d like to know more about the instructor&amp;#39;s response: I&amp;#39;m sure whoever he or she was was equally polite, and addressed the question in a proper way…and if the student was actually asked to leave, it was because he was being disruptive and a distraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be subject to lower grades when they give wrong answers. Schultz is wrong, because creationists do not deal with the same information — they are selective, ignore all of the evidence that contradicts their claims, and give very, very bad arguments for their position. They invite ridicule; stupid is as stupid does, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim of persecution is typical, too. Here they are, free to express their uninformed opinion, and even able to muster the money to build little echo chambers where they can babble about Flood Geology to each other, and they mistake the fact that real scientists are also free to point and laugh at the goofy superstitions of these wackaloons as evidence of oppression. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/whats_the_opposite_of_educatio.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YHt0ZQRDRAY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258123195943"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/as_if_they_need_help_with_this.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22d587335fb58d0f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">As if they need help with this</title><published>2009-11-13T12:54:09Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T12:54:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/iWJWrH2WTUQ/as_if_they_need_help_with_this.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/as_if_they_need_help_with_this.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clearly modeling his strategy after the anti-vaccination campaigns, &lt;a href="http://granades.com/2009/11/11/how-to-generate-scientific-controversy/"&gt;Stephen explains how to cobble up your own homemade controversy&lt;/a&gt; on just about any subject.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have been getting a bit serious around here. Of course, there's been a lot to get serious about, what with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/blogging_suzanne_somers_knockout_part_2.php"&gt;Suzanne Somers promoting cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/desiree_jennings_cured.php"&gt;Generation Rescue exploiting a young woman with problems&lt;/a&gt; in order to promote its anti-vaccine agenda (leading to my "friend" J.B. Handley launching yet another hilariously off-base love letter to me), and my ruminations on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/rethinking_cancer_screening.php"&gt;disappointment of cancer screening&lt;/a&gt;, things have gotten heavy to the point where they may be a bit of a downer. Add to that the fact that over the last week we've had one of the most persistent and annoying &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/idiotic_comment_of_the_week.php"&gt;infestations of anti-vaccine trolls&lt;/a&gt; that we've had in a long time, topped off by an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/combatting_holocaust_denial_ur_doing_it.php"&gt;infestation of Holocaust deniers&lt;/a&gt;, things &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; become a bit of downer here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I need some woo, and I need it fast. In fact, I need &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;-grade woo to lighten things up. And what better to lighten things up, both literally and figuratively, than lasers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, baby! I'm talkin' laser woo, and you all know that every woo is better with lasers! What better laser woo to take on than &lt;a href="http://www.qlaserhealinglight.com"&gt;QLaser Healing Light Low Level Lasers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None that I've seen recently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_theres_no_woo_li_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_theres_no_woo_li_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/P1_7wVLgbok" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258121969677"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5072083358283231365">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe59fc6c7dd847cd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I Will Be Debating Dinesh D&amp;#39;Souza</title><published>2009-11-19T04:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-17T22:36:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/EtgVxx7Da6s/i-will-be-debating-dinesh-dsouza.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5072083358283231365/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5072083358283231365" title="12 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-will-be-debating-dinesh-dsouza.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">I have been given a formal invitation to debate Dinesh D'Souza on Feburary 10th at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

The decision came quickly — details are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1884"&gt;Less body in your lexicon?&lt;/a&gt;", 11/11/2009), I gave evidence confirming that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; are more formal than &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; (because the&lt;em&gt; __body / __ one&lt;/em&gt; ratio is an order of magnitude larger in speech than in academic writing). But I also offered evidence that the &lt;em&gt;__one&lt;/em&gt; forms are taking over from the&lt;em&gt; __body&lt;/em&gt; forms, in all registers of English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this evidence came from apparent-time differences in conversational transcripts, where it seems that the younger people are, the more likely they are to choose &lt;em&gt;__one&lt;/em&gt; forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BodyAge.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BodyAge.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of the evidence came from historical-time counts, for example in the BYU Time Magazine corpus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TimeBodyOne1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TimeBodyOne1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that the x-axis numbers are the first years of decade-long bins — thus the value plotted at 1940 is the value for texts published between 1940 and 1949.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jerry Goldman of oyez.org and Tim Stanley of justia.com, I've got a nearly-complete archive of U.S. Supreme Court opinions in html form, and I extracted the year-by-year lexical histograms for an earlier Breakfast Experiment in which I tracked the trends in SCOTUS use of sentence-initial conjunctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SCOTUS_Coord2.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SCOTUS_Coord2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was just a couple of minutes' work to check on the evolution of the __body / __one ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year-by-year ratios are quite noisy, since all of the relevant words are relatively rare in these texts, so I averaged by decade. The results since 1866 look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SCOTUS_SomeEvery.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SCOTUS_SomeEvery.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is different in various ways from the Time Magazine data. The Time -body peak seems to be in the 1940-1950 decade, while the SCOTUS  peak seems to be in 1916-1925. And compared to Time, SCOTUS has anomalously-low values for the &lt;em&gt;somebody/something&lt;/em&gt; ratio in the 1926-1935 and 1936-1945 decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme Court opinions are not an ideal source of evidence for analyzing this phenomenon, because the number of authors is small and erratically variable, and (as in formal writing in general) the counts for these particular words are low overall. So in this case, the court's opinion may not have very wide application. Still, the SCOTUS data is consistent with a general decline, over the past few decades, in the frequency of &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; relative to &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I'm provisionally convinced that in this case, the culture as a whole (or at least its American portion) is trending fairly strongly towards the more formal member of two related pairs of words that are roughly equivalent in meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of another documented example of a case where the language as a whole is trending away from the vernacular rather than towards it — can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Here are the raw SCOTUS counts in tabular form:
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total words&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Somebody&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Someone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Everybody&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Everyone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1866-1875&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4,681,448&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;77&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1876-1885&lt;/td&gt;

What is it about our brain function that makes us aware of our own existence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not simply an emergent property of having enough neurons wired together. A popular notion in science fiction is that artificial intelligence may unexpectedly emerge out of a sufficiently powerful computer – such as Vger or SkyNet. But this scenario is highly unlikely. Consciousness appears to be a specific function of thinking systems, not just a consequence of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the cerebellum is a specialized part of the brain involved with motor coordination. It contains about the same number of neurons and connections that the cortex does, but the cerebellum itself is not conscious nor does it appear to contribute to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists and psychologists have also been able to demonstrate experimentally for years that some brain processes are conscious – we experience them as our own thoughts and sensations; while others are entirely subconscious – we have no awareness of them. While it is clear that it is brain processes that are generating consciousness, we do not know what it is precisely that is different about conscious and subconscious processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is of far more than academic interest. In some patients who are comatose but retain some brain function it is difficult to say exactly how much consciousness they may have. Our inferences from the neurological exam are probably accurate in most cases, but there is a twilight zone of brain function where a shadow of consciousness may remain but be undetected by standard exam. Studies with fMRI scans are beginning to show that such patients may actually be processing sensory input in a conscious way. This does not mean that they are fully awake and just trapped in a comatose body – consciousness is not a binary state, you can be a little conscious. Imagine yourself extremely sleepy, barely awake and on the brink of falling asleep. Or, alternatively, imagine someone who is so drunk they can barely stand. They have some consciousness, but clearly not full consciousness, and likely will not remember much in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding consciousness will likely also be helpful if we ever want to build true AI. We can accomplish this by simply copying the brain, in which case we can create AI without fully understanding it, but that is a suboptimal situation. It will be to our advantage to have a very high degree of control over the properties of any AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another application of understanding consciousness would be to explore the minds of animals with whom we cannot directly converse. How conscious is a cow, actually?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18150-signature-of-consciousness-captured-in-brain-scans.html"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; by neuroscientists at Cambridge claims to have found a possible signature of conscious processing. What they did is compare two tasks – looking at pictures of houses and faces so that they are consciously experienced, and looking at the same pictures in a way that they are not consciously experienced. In the latter case, each eye was presented with a separate picture – one with the house or face in green on orange, and the other with the colors reversed. The conscious brain perceives these overlapping images as just a yellow blur, but the images are still processed subconsciously. In this way the researchers hoped to isolate the variable of conscious experience of the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a reasonable technique to me, although I am not sure how complete the isolation of the conscious variable is. Differences in visual processes are also likely to be present – separate from conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, what they found was that with the conscious images fMRI responses were very consistent from trial to trial – each time the subject looked at the picture they displayed a similar pattern of brain activity. When the subconscious images were viewed, however, there was a much more random pattern of brain activity. From this they conclude that one signature of conscious processing is a consistency of patterns of brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this property is reproducible across other experimental designs (you cannot really conclude much from a single such experiment) it may provide one additional piece to the puzzle of consciousness. Perhaps the consistency comes from the fact that certain brain networks core to the function of conscious awareness are always involved in consciousness. It would be nice, of course, to discover what those core networks are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have focused on the intensity of neural activation as a property of consciousness. This makes sense also, as it certainly appears clinically that a minimal level of cortical activity is necessary in order to generate wakefulness. Consciousness therefore appears to be a very energetic function, perhaps because it requires coordinated activation across a broad area of the cortex (not just the function of one small piece of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly the nature of consciousness is coming into focus. If confirmed, this is just a baby step, but slow steady small steps is the norm for scientific progress these days (the press prefers breakthroughs and eureka moments, but these are rare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is likely to be a problem like the origin of life or even curing cancer – a many decade long project that will see mostly incremental advances, too slow to perceive, like watching the hour hand of a clock. But when we step back and look at the big picture, it is clear that we are slowly advancing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258116342555"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/friday_cephalopod_nom_nom_nom_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a1b118d9f31ff09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Nom nom nom</title><published>2009-11-13T12:32:48Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T12:32:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/S3rahsqg9Sk/friday_cephalopod_nom_nom_nom_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/friday_cephalopod_nom_nom_nom_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/11/friday_cephalopod_nom_nom_nom/nomnomnom.jpeg" width="425" height="282" alt="nomnomnom.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catholic Charities, a part of the Catholic Church, helps over 68,000 people in Washington D.C., including the homeless.  It’s not just volunteer work — they get paid for this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From 2006 through 2008, [council member David A.] Catania said, Catholic Charities received about $8.2 million in city contracts, as well as several hundred thousand dollars’ worth this year through his committee.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a new bill gets passed by the city council next month which would make it illegal for groups receiving city money to discriminate against gay people, they will be “&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/11/AR2009111116943.html?hpid=topnews&amp;amp;sid=ST2009042801406"&gt;unable to continue the social service programs&lt;/a&gt;“?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How bigoted do you have to be to refuse to help people because you’re more concerned about &lt;a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/2009/10/13/poor/"&gt;restricting rights&lt;/a&gt; from other people?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least some of the city council members are speaking out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The church’s influence seems limited. In separate interviews Wednesday, council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) &lt;strong&gt;referred to the church as “somewhat childish.”&lt;/strong&gt; Another council member, David A. Catania (I-At Large), said he would rather end the city’s relationship with the church than give in to its demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t represent, in my mind, an indispensable component of our social services infrastructure,” said Catania, the sponsor of the same-sex marriage bill and the chairman of the Health Committee.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End the relationship.  Good riddance.  Hopefully, other groups will step in to fill in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to how &lt;strong&gt;Susan Gibbs&lt;/strong&gt;, the spokesperson for the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, defends the Church’s actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She said religious groups that receive city funds would be required to give same-sex couples medical benefits, open adoptions to same-sex couples and rent a church hall to a support group for lesbian couples.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes sense.  I think it was &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:21&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Jesus who said&lt;/a&gt;, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven… unless you treat the gays with any dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a number of factors are responsible for this oversight, including relative geographical isolation (Uzbekistan, along with Liechtenstein, is one of the world’s doubly landlocked nations, requiring crossing two other nations to gain access to the oceans), which currently limits energy exports available for the global market, there are a number of pluses that the country has for investors willing to “think outside the box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a population of 27 million, Uzbekistan is Central Asia's most populous and dominant power. A conservative fiscal policy since 1991, including inconvertibility of the national currency, the som, has shielded its citizens from the hyperinflation that ravaged other former Soviet republics, but the policy previously diminished potential foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the global recession that began a year ago, however, Uzbekistan’s fiscal conservatism, previously dismissed by the foreign investment community, has looked more and more like a pragmatic policy that isolated the country from the worst aspects of the recession in stark contrast to other post-Soviet states that fervently embraced free market capitalism like Lithuania, whose economy contracted 18.1% this year and is expected to shrink further by 3.9% in 2010. In a move certain to be welcomed by foreign investor Uzbekistan is slowly moving towards making its currency convertible but whenever it happens, for the present the country offers a fiscal stability unmatched by many of its more free-market neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the good news about the country’s resources. In 2006 Uzbekistan's natural gas reserves were estimated at 1.798 trillion cubic meters (tcm). During the Soviet era Uzbekistan was the USSR’s third-largest producer of natural gas, accounting for more than 10% of the Soviet Union’s production, trailing only Russia and Turkmenistan. In 1992, the country’s first year of independence, Uzbekistan produced 42.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas. Uzbekistan currently produces 60 bcm of natural gas annually, an amount nearly equal to Turkmenistan's production. Uzbekistan’s reserves are primarily concentrated in Qashqadaryo province and near Bukhara in the country’s south-central region. During the 1970s Uzbekistan’s largest natural gas deposit at Boyangora-Gadzhak was discovered in Surkhandaryia province north of the Afghan border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike its energy-rich neighbors to the West, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, nearly 80 percent of Uzbekistan's production, about 48.4 bcm, is currently reserved for domestic use at heavily subsidized rates. Of the remaining 12 bcm of natural gas that Uzbekistan exports, more than half currently goes to Russia, with the remainder to neighboring Central Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Uzbekistan’s fiercely patriotic President Islam Karimov relations with Europe’s favorite bête noire, Russia’s state-owned gas firm Gazprom, have been subject to fierce negotiations to win an equitable price for the country’s exports. Like other former Soviet republics, the Uzbek government chafed under Gazprom's "buy cheap, sell dear" policies and in early December 2008 scored a significant negotiating success by getting an agreement that in 2009 Gazprom would pay $305 per thousand cubic meters (tcm). To put the accomplishment in perspective, Uzbekistan’s state gas company Uzbekneftegaz sold gas to Gazprom for $130 per tcm in the first half of 2008, which then rose to $160 in the second half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those betting on the eventual pacification of Afghanistan and the subsequent pipelines that would crisscross the country to deliver Central Asian gas to the massive Pakistani and Indian markets would also do well to take note of Uzbekistan’s persistent, low key policies over more than a decade attempting to bring peace to its hapless southern neighbor. The initiatives put forward by Uzbek President Islom Karimov during the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008 take on heightened importance as one of the few foreign policy ideas offering some hope to quelling Afghanistan’s three decades of turmoil. The text of Karimov’s address can &lt;a href="http://www.jahonnews.uz/eng/sections/politics/address_by_president_of_the_republic_of_uzbekistan_he_mr_islam_karimov.mgr"&gt;be found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly completely overshadowed by the Bush administration’s relentless efforts to have Georgia and Ukraine join the alliance, Karimov proposed that the UN’s Afghanistan "6 plus 2" assembly, established in 1999, be revived by expanding it into a "6 plus 3" ensemble by including NATO because of its anti-terrorist operations in Afghanistan among the "six" members Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, China and Iran and the "two," the United States and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that that it is impossible to solve Afghanistan's problems without the direct involvement of neighboring countries, which have felt the destructive impact of the Afghan crisis for more than 30 years, as Afghanistan's problems are now of global nature, Karimov told his audience in Bucharest that their resolution must also be global, with the participation of members of the international coalition that comprise NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Karimov concluded by noting that the current situation in Afghanistan precludes a purely military solution and that while it is possible to continue increasing the foreign military presence there, without a clear model of national reconciliation it will be impossible to end the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, one of the benefits of peace and the aforementioned pipelines for Uzbekistan would be that it could export its surplus gas through Afghanistan to southern Asian markets for a higher price than it receives at home or Gazprom’s miserly accountants. Acting on Tashkent’s belief that economic assistance is of greater utility than military operations, Uzbekistan has become involved in a host of reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, including railways, power generation, mining, agriculture, irrigation, education and the exchange of specialists as well as providing its neighbor with construction materials, metals, fertilizer, food and other goods. Uzbek companies and engineers have built 11 bridges in the Mazar-e-Sharif-Kabul area and are finishing the construction of a 275-mile high-voltage line capable of transmitting 150 megawatts from Termez to Kabul across some of the world’s most mountainous terrain, which when it becomes fully operational next month, will provide power and light not only to the capital but the country’s five northern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Uzbekistan remains largely a transit country rather than a net energy exporter in its own right. But the fiercely independent nationalist policy that Tashkent has followed since 1991 indicates that any company whose policies most benefit the country will have an inside track, and as the old saying goes, “fortune favors the bold.” Chinese, Malaysian, Russian and South Korean companies have already begun investing in Uzbekistan’s energy infrastructure – what do they seemingly know that American and European companies do not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a number of factors are responsible for this oversight, including relative geographical isolation (Uzbekistan, along with Liechtenstein, is one of the world’s doubly landlocked nations, requiring crossing two other nations to gain access to the oceans), which currently limits energy exports available for the global market, there are a number of pluses that the country has for investors willing to “think outside the box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a population of 27 million, Uzbekistan is Central Asia's most populous and dominant power. A conservative fiscal policy since 1991, including inconvertibility of the national currency, the som, has shielded its citizens from the hyperinflation that ravaged other former Soviet republics, but the policy previously diminished potential foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the global recession that began a year ago, however, Uzbekistan’s fiscal conservatism, previously dismissed by the foreign investment community, has looked more and more like a pragmatic policy that isolated the country from the worst aspects of the recession in stark contrast to other post-Soviet states that fervently embraced free market capitalism like Lithuania, whose economy contracted 18.1% this year and is expected to shrink further by 3.9% in 2010. In a move certain to be welcomed by foreign investor Uzbekistan is slowly moving towards making its currency convertible but whenever it happens, for the present the country offers a fiscal stability unmatched by many of its more free-market neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the good news about the country’s resources. In 2006 Uzbekistan's natural gas reserves were estimated at 1.798 trillion cubic meters (tcm). During the Soviet era Uzbekistan was the USSR’s third-largest producer of natural gas, accounting for more than 10% of the Soviet Union’s production, trailing only Russia and Turkmenistan. In 1992, the country’s first year of independence, Uzbekistan produced 42.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas. Uzbekistan currently produces 60 bcm of natural gas annually, an amount nearly equal to Turkmenistan's production. Uzbekistan’s reserves are primarily concentrated in Qashqadaryo province and near Bukhara in the country’s south-central region. During the 1970s Uzbekistan’s largest natural gas deposit at Boyangora-Gadzhak was discovered in Surkhandaryia province north of the Afghan border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike its energy-rich neighbors to the West, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, nearly 80 percent of Uzbekistan's production, about 48.4 bcm, is currently reserved for domestic use at heavily subsidized rates. Of the remaining 12 bcm of natural gas that Uzbekistan exports, more than half currently goes to Russia, with the remainder to neighboring Central Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Uzbekistan’s fiercely patriotic President Islam Karimov relations with Europe’s favorite bête noire, Russia’s state-owned gas firm Gazprom, have been subject to fierce negotiations to win an equitable price for the country’s exports. Like other former Soviet republics, the Uzbek government chafed under Gazprom's "buy cheap, sell dear" policies and in early December 2008 scored a significant negotiating success by getting an agreement that in 2009 Gazprom would pay $305 per thousand cubic meters (tcm). To put the accomplishment in perspective, Uzbekistan’s state gas company Uzbekneftegaz sold gas to Gazprom for $130 per tcm in the first half of 2008, which then rose to $160 in the second half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those betting on the eventual pacification of Afghanistan and the subsequent pipelines that would crisscross the country to deliver Central Asian gas to the massive Pakistani and Indian markets would also do well to take note of Uzbekistan’s persistent, low key policies over more than a decade attempting to bring peace to its hapless southern neighbor. The initiatives put forward by Uzbek President Islom Karimov during the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008 take on heightened importance as one of the few foreign policy ideas offering some hope to quelling Afghanistan’s three decades of turmoil. The text of Karimov’s address can &lt;a href="http://www.jahonnews.uz/eng/sections/politics/address_by_president_of_the_republic_of_uzbekistan_he_mr_islam_karimov.mgr"&gt;be found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly completely overshadowed by the Bush administration’s relentless efforts to have Georgia and Ukraine join the alliance, Karimov proposed that the UN’s Afghanistan "6 plus 2" assembly, established in 1999, be revived by expanding it into a "6 plus 3" ensemble by including NATO because of its anti-terrorist operations in Afghanistan among the "six" members Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, China and Iran and the "two," the United States and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that that it is impossible to solve Afghanistan's problems without the direct involvement of neighboring countries, which have felt the destructive impact of the Afghan crisis for more than 30 years, as Afghanistan's problems are now of global nature, Karimov told his audience in Bucharest that their resolution must also be global, with the participation of members of the international coalition that comprise NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Karimov concluded by noting that the current situation in Afghanistan precludes a purely military solution and that while it is possible to continue increasing the foreign military presence there, without a clear model of national reconciliation it will be impossible to end the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, one of the benefits of peace and the aforementioned pipelines for Uzbekistan would be that it could export its surplus gas through Afghanistan to southern Asian markets for a higher price than it receives at home or Gazprom’s miserly accountants. Acting on Tashkent’s belief that economic assistance is of greater utility than military operations, Uzbekistan has become involved in a host of reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, including railways, power generation, mining, agriculture, irrigation, education and the exchange of specialists as well as providing its neighbor with construction materials, metals, fertilizer, food and other goods. Uzbek companies and engineers have built 11 bridges in the Mazar-e-Sharif-Kabul area and are finishing the construction of a 275-mile high-voltage line capable of transmitting 150 megawatts from Termez to Kabul across some of the world’s most mountainous terrain, which when it becomes fully operational next month, will provide power and light not only to the capital but the country’s five northern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Uzbekistan remains largely a transit country rather than a net energy exporter in its own right. But the fiercely independent nationalist policy that Tashkent has followed since 1991 indicates that any company whose policies most benefit the country will have an inside track, and as the old saying goes, “fortune favors the bold.” Chinese, Malaysian, Russian and South Korean companies have already begun investing in Uzbekistan’s energy infrastructure – what do they seemingly know that American and European companies do not?&lt;/p&gt;

David Rakel and colleagues have found that patients who rate their doctor as highly empathic recover more quickly from a cold. Their illness is shortened by about a day - the same effect shown by the most promising anti-viral drugs. But a doctor&amp;#39;s empathy, unlike the anti-viral, doesn&amp;#39;t trigger nausea and diarrhoea.Three hundred and fifty participants were asked to contact the researchers as soon as they noticed the first sign of a cold, at which point they were invited in for a consultation with a doctor. The doctors had received special training from actors in how to come across as sympathetic and understanding and for half the participants they turned on the charm, whereas they gave others a less warm, standard consultation. The research programme is ongoing and which participants received which kind of consultation is still under-wraps so as not to bias future results (to keep the trial &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; in the official jargon). However, all the participants rated their doctors empathy and attentiveness and it&amp;#39;s from these scores that the key finding emerged.The 84 participants who gave their doctors a perfect score for empathy and attentiveness recovered from their colds about a day earlier on average; showed a trend towards less severe symptoms; and exhibited double the rise in a marker for immune system activity (biomarker IL-8), as sampled from their noses.Rather curiously, there was no gradual, &amp;quot;dose-response&amp;quot; effect of doctors&amp;#39; empathy on the participants&amp;#39; recovery. It was only those participants who gave their doctors a perfect empathy score who showed improved recovery. &amp;quot;This may suggest that the perception of empathy by patients may be more of an &amp;#39;on or off&amp;#39; phenomenon than a graduated response,&amp;quot; the researchers said. &amp;quot;We either feel empathy or we don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;Of course, one possible explanation for the results is that there is something distinct about people who give their doctors perfect empathy ratings, and it&amp;#39;s this key trait that&amp;#39;s the true cause of their speedier recovery. However, the researchers checked, and the link between a perfect empathy score and recovery still held even after controlling for the effects of participants&amp;#39; age, race, education, stress, optimism, self-reported poorliness and quality of life.&amp;quot;This finding is in need of replication,&amp;quot; the researchers concluded. &amp;quot;Until then, including empathy in the clinical encounter has little potential for harm and has positive influences that extend beyond the medical consultation.&amp;quot; _________________________________Rakel DP, Hoeft TJ, Barrett BP, Chewning BA, Craig BM, &amp;amp; Niu M (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Elena Rozhkova, scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago’s Brain Tumor Center have developed the first nanoparticles that seek out and destroy glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain cancer cells without damaging nearby healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomedicine, an offshoot of nanotechnology, refers to highly specific medical intervention at the molecular scale for curing disease or repairing damaged tissues, such as bone, muscle, nerve, or brain cells. Nanoparticles – anywhere from 100 to 2500 nanometers in size – are at the same scale as the biological molecules and structures inside living cells. Cancer detection using nanoparticles shows great promise as a therapy for certain types of cancer. And the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) is taking nanoparticles very seriously. The NIH has established a national network of eight Nanomedicine Development Centers, which serve as the intellectual and technological core of the NIH Nanomedicine Roadmap Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When State Sen. Yance McGill was asked by the Associated Press in May 2009 whether he would support a Wiccan tag, he said, “Well, that’s not what I consider to be a religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about a Buddhist tag, he said “I’d have to look at the individual situation. But I’m telling you, I firmly believe in this [Christian] tag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Bill Sandifer also backed the “Christian” plate, but emphatically asserted that he would never do the same for a plate featuring Islamic symbols and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely and positively no,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, let’s not forget, [ed: Lt. Gov] Bauer himself also said no to the same question.&lt;/p&gt;

And this will no doubt generate more publicity than the billboard itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Then it got erased and so they chalked everything again, only to have that erased to. And now the story has gotten them some great new publicity, which like the Cincinnati billboard incident, will likely reach a much larger audience than originally intended. Thanks assholes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’ve always tried to analyze things because I want to be lawyer,” Will said. “I really don’t feel that there’s currently liberty and justice for all.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of our interview, I ask young Will a question that might be a civics test nightmare for your average 10-year-old. Will’s answer, though, is good enough — simple enough, true enough — to give me a little rush of goose pimples. &lt;strong&gt;What does being an American mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Freedom of speech,” Will says, without even stopping to think. “The freedom to disagree. That’s what I think pretty much being an American represents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.desktopnexus.com/wallpapers/87844-bigthumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.desktopnexus.com/wallpapers/87844-bigthumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091111130942.htm"&gt;Why chimps can’t speak&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suspect that part of the answer to the mystery lies in a gene called FOXP2. When mutated, FOXP2 can disrupt speech and language in humans. Now, a UCLA/Emory study reveals major differences between how the human and chimp versions of FOXP2 work, perhaps explaining why language is unique to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published Nov. 11 in the online edition of the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the findings provide insight into the evolution of the human brain and may point to possible drug targets for human disorders characterized by speech disruption, such as autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was a great physicist, animated by passion and joy. I was last in his office, at CITA, two years ago. As usual, the conversation stretched across wide swaths of physics, governed only by Lev’s irrepressible enthusiasm and interest. He will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lev Kofman: June 17, 1957 – November 12, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply saddened  to inform you that the fabulous Lev Kofman, husband of Anna, father of Sergei 13 and Maria 15, brother of Svetlana, and our great friend, died in the early morning of November 12 from cancer. Many of you were able to commune with Lev as the situation deteriorated over the past weeks, by visits, phone calls, and emails read to him. We are deeply grateful for that: and it provided some solace for Lev to know the tremendous impact he has had on the lives of so many of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/11/lev_kofman-290x300.jpg" alt="lev_kofman" title="lev_kofman" width="290" height="300"&gt;He bravely kept the physics going strong throughout his illness, characteristic of Lev. His scientific outpourings and influence  will transcend this passage. As you know, he made fundamental contributions to Lambda cosmology and dark energy, structure in the cosmic web, inflationary theory, its Gaussian and non-Gaussian aspects, and gravitational waves. He initiated and developed the theory of preheating, showing how all matter could arise from a coherent vacuum energy at the end of inflation, his cosmic baby. And much more besides. He was the quintessential leader, for CITA and CIFAR as a whole, and for the vibrant early universe group he established, providing inspirational guidance to a generation of young researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He felt the physics to his very core. Beyond this, it is the indomitable, fun-loving, deeply philosophical spirit, a gourmand of life in all its manifestations, that we will miss so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our best wishes in these sad times,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xqZNxuZSNek%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26hd%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course she’s too much of a media whore to actually walk out, so she just threatens to walk out while still glued to her chair so tightly that even the jaws of life couldn’t pry her loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/12/carrie-prejean-the-bible_n_355745.html"&gt;But then came her interview with the publication Christianity Today&lt;/a&gt; (an oxymoron if I ever heard one). In that interview she essentially rationalizes her controversial and even scandalous behavior (only scandalous in that it exposes the hypocrasy of her self-righteous, “traditional Christian values”) by saying that the Bible allows breast implants and that she’s not homophobic because she has gay hairdressers whom she presumably doesn’t burn at the stake (which even makes the “I have gay friends” defense seem brilliant by comparison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and she also gives an account of her self-sex tape story that doesn’t corroberate her ex-boyfriend’s version of the story. Her boyfriend said the incident took place when she was twenty. She now says it was when she was seventeen. I’m not mathematician but if my calculations are correct, that’s almost like three years off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview also reveals how she became Jesus’ bitch, which not surprising, is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE5_OwtT1pY"&gt;one of the six classic reasons people become “born-again.&lt;/a&gt;” I would have pegged her as the party girl who started to tire of the lifestyle by the time Christians confronted her about Jesus. But no, turns out that she was one of those who didn’t fit until the Christian vultures showed up to shower her with love on the condition that she joined their cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes the obligatory line where she projects her own faults onto Parez Hilton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. I actually feel really sorry for him. I really do. If you look at his website, it’s kind of scary what he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s scary what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes this little gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with getting breast implants as a Christian. I think it’s a personal decision. I don’t see anywhere in the Bible where it says you shouldn’t get breast implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s funny, because I don’t see anywhere in the Bible where it says anything about gay marriage, abortion, stem cell research,  either. So I guess that means Jesus is cool with it, huh. And what about that part in the Bible that says women have to go out into the forest while menstruating? That’s something that the Bible DOES say. I don’t see you following that rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and did I mention that Ms. Prejean’s ex-boyfriend (the one she allegedly sent her solo-sex tape to &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/11/12/carrie-prejeans-ex-boyfriend-sex-tape-lie-age/"&gt;is now claiming that her people contacted him and specifically told him to lie and say she was 17 when she shot the video&lt;/a&gt;.This is kind of confusing to me because on the one hand, as long as she was “seventeen,” it makes it easier to write it all off as a minor child indiscression. But doesn’t her being “seventeen” eradicate the whole wholesom, “brought up on traditional Christian values” card she’s been trying to play? If I were her, I’d prefer everyone believe it happened when I was twenty because at least I can play the “we were both consenting adults who didn’t actually have any premarital sex” card. And while her ex-boyfriend is in trouble given the whole no-wasted-seed and no coveting passages in the Bible, there’s nothing in the Bible as far as I’m aware that necessarily condemns her videotaping herself masturbating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course among the already indoctrinated, all she seems to be able to get an amazing level of traction by just diverting the discussion to attacking the evil liberals for picking on her and all the other conservative women. In fact, if her book jacket is any indication, that’s the whole thesis of her book. As long as conservatives focus on the alleged liberals who are just out to get her by airing her dirty laundry in public, they won’t be thinking about what it is that’s actually being exposed and whether or not it’s actually true. So congratulations to Carrie Prejean’s PR people, who truly are brilliant manipulators.&lt;/p&gt;

on Greg Laden’s Blog without going off on a tangent. I suppose my thoughts are just typically quite scattered when I am reading blogs, but anyway, the following is my stream of consciousness after reading aforementioned post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve often wondered how someone can claim the title of being “pro-life” as if the opposition is “pro-death” or “pro-murder.” It certainly seems like a loaded term in and of itself, but how in favor of life are these individuals in the first place? Are they really “anti-choice” or merely “anti-abortion?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do most “pro-life” groups define “life” and why do they define it this way? Many, as far as I can tell, define “life” as the moment of gamete fusion, but this ignores a great deal about the term “living” versus “nonliving” in biology. Oocytes and spermatozoa are both living cells. While they are incapable of proliferation individually, and thus cannot “reproduce,” they are capable of all other characteristics of “living organism.”(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some religious organizations are opposed to any contraceptives (hormonal, physical, or surgical) thus making individuals either sexually frustrated or overburdened with children (or both). Additionally, abortions and contraceptives have been quite common over the course of human history ranging from herbal abortifacient blends to the insertion of metal implements into the uterus to extreme abdominal pressure. The survival rate of children to adulthood has also increased dramatically in the past millennium. Perhaps we should consider exactly what it means to be &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;pro&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;life&lt;/span&gt; anti-choice in light of the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently faced with the problem of the human population. While not all areas of the globe are covered with humans like my back yard is covered in &lt;em&gt;Solenopsis invicta&lt;/em&gt;, we have still managed to begin scouring the planet of biodiversity and resources. It should be pointed out that humans have been responsible for a great deal of the loss of biodiversity in the past century and continue to be the greatest threat to life on Earth. To continue with our population increase will certainly not help matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall not resort to the slippery slope that is “argument from possible consequences,” and shall, instead, migrate back to the present. What motives do the anti-choice have for preventing abortion? Aside from the intrinsic views of their religions that women are progeny factories, I have yet to come across any substantial argument against abortion. The argument about embryos being “human” is to intentionally misunderstand biology in an attempt to define &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; with the sole purpose of creating a tautology within the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P1) We shouldn’t kill another human&lt;br&gt;
P2) An embryo is a human&lt;br&gt;
C) We should not kill an embryo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing here is WHY is an embryo defined as “human” and what characteristics is this person using to assign such a label? Is there any specific reason (other than for the argument) that an embryo would be considered “human?” I don’t think there is. Often, anti-choice individuals resort to another point, which is equally spurious. This point is one of vitalism, the notion that humans possess “souls” and that these “souls” are given at the moment of fertilization. I hesitate to ask, but what happens for a miscarriage? What about embryos which do not implant into the uterus? What happens to the “soul” when an embryo splits into monozygotic twins? How does this soul interact with the body? For that matter, what does it do? Since we have absolutely no evidence of a soul, we should assume the null hypothesis that said soul does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) It could be said, by inclusion of the “reproduction” qualification, sterile hybrids are not living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve stated my opinion on the notion of abortion several times before. To reiterate: I strongly support the right of any human to control the number of offspring he or she wishes to have. The decision to have a child rests solely upon the individuals that will care for this offspring. This means the woman housing this organism for 40 weeks has a particularly strong say in the matter if she does not wish for her body to be the feeding ground of said developing organism since she is required to alter her behaviors for said offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the coverage of contraceptives of any form by health insurance companies, they should be as required to cover abortion procedures and contraceptive pills as they are required to cover vaccinations, emergency medicine, and prenatal care. Any reform which refuses any of these is not medical coverage, but criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex pheromones are widely used by mammals to communicate and detect the sexual status of a potential mate. This is particularly the case with female mammals, whose pheromones are primarily detected by a structure known as the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is in the base of the nose/roof of the mouth. (And no, humans don’t have a functional VNO, although it does appear briefly during embryogenesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of smell receptor molecules in the VNO –  V1Rs look pretty much like an ordinary smell receptor, and the neurons that house them send their axons into the part of the brain that deals with food and so on. But the other kind of receptor – V2Rs – look very different and project to a different part of the brain. The assumption is that key parts of mammalian pheromones are detected by the V2Rs, but that pheromones often contain a blend of compounds, some of which may be detected by V1Rs and by a specialised receptors called TAARs in the main part of the nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really interesting thing is quite how far back these receptors go. The recent sequencing of the Platypus genome showed that there were V1R and V2R genes, strongly suggesting that this form of communication goes back at least 165 MY:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/nature06936-f1-23.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Mammal evolution" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/nature06936-f1-23.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=541" alt="Mammal evolution" width="500" height="541"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mammalian evolution – &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;453&lt;/strong&gt;, 175-183 (8 May 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So what does a male mammal do when he detects a pheromone? Anyone with a horse – or a cat! – will know. He produces what is known as “Flehmen”, a characteristic curling back of the lip, with the mouth held open. Cats do this when they smell the urine sprayed by a male, and get a faraway, stoned look in the eyes while they’re about it. Here’s a picture of a tapir showing Flehmen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;img title="Tapir flehmen" src="http://unclestinky.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/flehmenresponse.jpg?w=513&amp;amp;h=409" alt="" width="513" height="409"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So do marsurpials show Flehmen? You betcha! Here’s a  video of a male kangaroo testing the reproductive status of a female, by tasting her urine. Note the “flehmen” response he makes with his mouth, just like a placental mammal. Note the way he shakes his head afterwards… Who can blame him? DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME!&lt;/p&gt;

And luckily for all of you, Sci is the one doing the reading and the retelling of this study.  Because reading the methods for this one might cause you to do this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;American Scientist Pizza Lunch convenes again at noon, Tuesday, Nov. 24 at Sigma Xi's headquarters in Research Triangle Park. 

&lt;p&gt;The speaker will be &lt;b&gt;Alex Huang&lt;/b&gt;, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State University. Prof. Huang is directly engaged with trying to reduce this country's dependence on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. He directs a national research center working on a redesign of the nation's power grid to better integrate alternative energy sources and new storage methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Scientist Pizza Lunch is free and open to science journalists and science communicators of all stripes. Feel free to forward this message to anyone who might want to attend. RSVPs are required (for a reliable slice count) to cclabby@amsci.org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, thanks to a combination of disingenuous Mayans, misunderstandings involving the Temples of Syrinx, the teachings of self-styled “gurus” like “the guy who killed all those people in a sweat lodge to unleash their ‘inner warriors,’” and John Cusack, people have started believing that the world is about to end.  To disabuse them of this idea, we put together a &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt; about the “Mayan Prophecy of 2012.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an overzealous editor took some of the vim out of our answers (most of my drafts included the word “moron”), and the whole page now reads more like it was written by the government than by NASA.  Nonetheless, this is a pretty awesome thing for NASA to be working on, and it certainly beats the hell out their standard fare of “adding a spare bedroom to the International Space Station” and “putting a chimp on the moon” and “forcing Howard Stern to move his show to satellite radio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the success of this “2012″ project, I’m hopeful that we’ll soon get the go-ahead to use NASA to debunk other religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mormonism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: Is there a planet or star called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob"&gt;Kolob&lt;/a&gt; that is closest to where god lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Kolob, like the rest of Mormonism, is a hoax perpetrated by Joseph Smith.   There is no factual basis for these claims. If Kolob was real, astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade, and it would be visible by now to the naked eye. Obviously, it does not exist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: Was there an interplanetary nation called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helatrobus"&gt;Helatrobus&lt;/a&gt; that existed around 40 trillion years ago, and that implanted the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_%28Scientology%29#Gorilla_Goals"&gt;Gorilla Goals&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: What are you, a moron?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hellenism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: Is there a “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Earth#Greek_Mythology"&gt;Counter-Earth&lt;/a&gt;” that was placed between our planet and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Fire"&gt;fiery hearth at the center of the universe&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent us from seeing Zeus’s throne?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, there are things in space that were put there in order to prevent us from seeing “Zeus’s throne.”  Also, babies come from &lt;a href="http://www.sadanduseless.com/2009/06/where-do-babies-come-from/"&gt;the cabbage patch&lt;/a&gt;, and if you put a tooth under your pillow a “fairy” will come at night and bring you a shiny new quarter!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judeo-Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: How do our spaceships not crash into the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament"&gt;solid vault of heaven&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would have the effect of denying women the right to use their own personal, private funds to purchase an insurance plan with abortion coverage in the new health system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must stop health-care reform from being enacted with this ban!&lt;/p&gt;

He quotes from a &lt;a href="http://legacy.newsobserver.com/1565/story/1765170.html"&gt;Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rosewood Middle School in Goldsboro...  will sell 20 test points to students in exchange for a $20-dollar donation.

&lt;p&gt;Students can add 10 extra points to each of two tests of their choosing. The extra points could take a student from a "B" to an "A" on a test or from a failing grade to a passing grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosewood's principal Susie Shepherd rejected the idea that extra points on two tests could make a difference in a final grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shepherd said she approved the idea when a parent advisory council presented it. "Last year they did chocolates and it didn't generate anything," Shepherd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this cash-for-points fundraiser &lt;a href="http://legacy.newsobserver.com/1573/story/1765697.html"&gt;didn't last long&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wayne County school administrators stopped the fundraiser, issuing a statement this morning.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Yesterday afternoon, the district administration met with [Rosewood Middle School principal] Mrs. Shepherd and directed the the following actions be taken: (1) the fundraiser will be immediately stopped; (2) no extra grade credit will be issued that may have resulted from donations; and (3) beginning Novermber 12, all donations will be returned."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steinn despairs at this whole situation.  I'm not liking it so much either.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This symbol is stylized et, Latin for &amp;quot;and.&amp;quot; Although it was invented by the Roman scribe Marcus Tullius Tiro in the first century B.C., it didn&amp;#39;t get its strange name until centuries later. In the early 1800s, schoolchildren learned this symbol as the 27th letter of the alphabet: X, Y, Z, &amp;amp;. But the symbol had no name. So, they ended their ABCs with &amp;quot;and, per se, and&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;&amp;amp;, which means &amp;#39;and.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; This phrase was slurred into one garbled word that eventually caught on with everyone: ampersand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One situation may be &lt;i&gt;analogous&lt;/i&gt; to another without being &lt;i&gt;identical&lt;/i&gt;, or they may not in fact be analogous at all.  Forgetting this principle can get you into a wee bit of trouble. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To formalize it a bit, just because you think "A" resembles "B", and "B" has property "P" does not mean that "A" also has property "P".  It may be that "A" is not quite enough like "B" to share all of its properties.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a weak analogy can't stop a weak but persistent mind.  Dana Ullman, Hahnemann's cognitively-impaired bulldog, has given us &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/when-militarism-invades-m_b_352676.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;a fantastically weak analogy &lt;/a&gt;with which he tries to  delegitimize all of modern medicine (to be replaced by...what?  That is his second logical fallacy: if "A" is bad, that does not mean "B" is better, a sort of &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt; in which he asserts that modern medicine is bad and therefore magic is better). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than drag you through a complete &lt;i&gt;fisking&lt;/i&gt; of the piece, I'll lay it out for you: doctors live by a military model in which arbitrarily-defined "enemies" (diseases) are blasted indiscriminately causing grave collateral damage.  He goes on to explain how dissenters are  quashed by being labelled as (gasp!) "unscientific".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of his brilliant flashes of insight include this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Doctors may even be able to go the next step and surgically remove a symptom or an obstructive agent, but the assumption that removing a single symptom or pathological agent will create health is both simplistic and incorrect.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, removing an inflamed appendix doesn't create total health and is therefore irrelevant---this one's a "Nirvana fallacy": because medicine isn't perfect, it is therefore wrong in its entirety.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/doctors_are_just_like_military.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/11/doctors_are_just_like_military.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/ZKQvvL8Dxag" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258078408966"><id gr:original-id="770 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a99029dd14fd259a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/media"/><title type="html">BBC Launch Radio</title><published>2009-11-13T02:10:45Z</published><updated>2009-11-13T02:10:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/770" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;Date: &lt;em&gt;1922-11-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Broadcasting_Company"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; launch their radio service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Professor Hubert Farnsworth: Urrectum. Here, let me locate it for you. 
&lt;br&gt;Fry: No, no, I, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Too bad that Futurama's &lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=156616&amp;amp;title=smelloscope"&gt;smell-o-scope&lt;/a&gt; doesn't actually exists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/your_galaxy_stinks/Smelloscope.JPG.jpeg" width="512" title="What does your galaxy smell like?" alt="Smelloscope.JPG.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it too bad?  Because space is filled with many different types of atoms, including Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen: the elements essential to terrestrial life.  In space, these sometimes appear in isolation, they sometimes appear in toxic combinations (like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide"&gt;hydrogen cyanide&lt;/a&gt;), and they sometimes appear as simple organic molecules, like sugars, alcohols, and esters.  (Amino acids may yet be there, but we haven't discovered them yet!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/apr/21/space-raspberries-amino-acids-astrobiology"&gt;astronomers turned their telescopes&lt;/a&gt; towards the galactic center, and looked at the dust cloud &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_B2"&gt;Sagittarius B2&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like this.  (And click it to enlarge.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/your_galaxy_stinks/phot-24e-09-fullres.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/your_galaxy_stinks/phot-24e-09-fullres.jpg" width="500" title="A pretty spectacular view, isn&amp;#39;t it?" alt="phot-24e-09-fullres.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Nebulae/phot-24e-09-fullres.tif.html"&gt;ESO&lt;/a&gt;.)  Sagittarius B2 is less than 400 light years from the galactic center.  They found over 50 chemical compounds there, but one of the most interesting?  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_formate"&gt;Ethyl formate&lt;/a&gt;, which we typically form on Earth by reacting ethyl alcohol (the alcohol found in wine, beer, and liquor) with formic acid (which is commonly produced by ants and bees).  The chemical compound is pretty simple, and looks like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/your_galaxy_stinks/800px-Ethyl-formate-3D-balls.png" width="500" title="Ethyl formate: not just for Earthlings anymore, is it?" alt="800px-Ethyl-formate-3D-balls.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's an organic molecule, but we produce these in space all the time.  What's particularly interesting about Ethyl Formate?  It's what gives Rum its smell, and give Raspberries their flavor!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/11/your_galaxy_stinks/bacardi-raspberry-mojito.jpg" width="500" title="I couldn&amp;#39;t find an image with both rum and raspberries, but raspberry-flavored rum?" alt="bacardi-raspberry-mojito.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's at least, partially, what our galaxy smells like!  Any Andromedans out there reading this?  We smell like Raspberries and Rum!  I have no idea what you smell like, but in comparison, I bet you stink compared to us!

That worked well for about two years, but by the time Nora was born, we decided to hire a part-time nanny so I could finish a degree of my own. When Nora was one and Greta and I were starting new jobs in a new state, both kids entered full-time day care, and that was our child-care arrangement until they started kindergarten.

Naturally, at every step along the way, we wondered whether we were making the right parenting decisions. We liked their nanny and their day-care center, but wouldn't it be better for the kids to be cared for full-time by their own parents? At that time, there wasn't a whole lot of research pointing one way or another. The definitive child-care study can probably never be done: Families would have to be randomly assigned to day-care centers or parent care for years, and then the impact of the assignments wouldn't be known until the children reached adulthood. Even then, you wouldn't know if the effects were due to particular parenting or day-care practices, or to the day-care versus parent-care assignment.

Realistically, the next best thing you can do is to follow children from birth to adulthood, and see if kids who happened to have been placed in day care (or with nannies, or grandparents, or some other arrangement) ended up better- or worse-off than those cared for by their mothers. Indeed, such a study was launched by the National Institute of Child Health and Development in the early 1990s. The results have been gradually trickling in as the children in the study aged. The most recent installment, published in 2007, covers kids through the sixth grade.

The study follows over 1,000 children who were randomly selected on their day of birth from ten U.S. hospitals. Researchers checked in intermittently with the families over the next dozen years, assessing both their family situation and the child care provided. Then when the kids entered school, they tracked their progress, got teacher reports on their social behavior, and continued to monitor the quality of their parenting (in addition to whether the kids were in after-school care programs).

… definitely don’t tell that to homeless man Anthony Martin, who has been a Christian since miraculously living through a two-year coma induced by five bullets to the head in 1979. He was shot in the head five times after being chased down in an alley for $16 three decades ago and was in a coma from 1979 to 1981, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was it luck that I lived or was it the grace of God?” Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the Best* Church of God, Pastor Dave Shepherd, countered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was it God’s grace that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust?” Shepherd said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward silence ensued.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well played, pastor.  Well played.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;em&gt;- Ernest Hemingway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'Tis the season of the flu, just like every year. But this year, there's something different. How different, you ask? Well, let's take a look at Ukraine:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934946,00.html"&gt;Ukraine is in the midst of what some might call swine-flu hysteria&lt;/a&gt;. The country is in virtual lockdown mode, with the government closing schools, universities and movie theaters and banning all public gatherings until the end of November. Pharmacies have run out of protective masks; those who missed the rush are improvising with scarves or homemade facsimiles. And rumors are running rampant, much as they did during Soviet times when the authorities tried to cover up disasters like the Chernobyl nuclear-plant meltdown. "We are worried that the swine flu has mutated and is killing scores of people," says Nina Sokolovska as she stands in line at a pharmacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flu that seems as deadly as an out-of-control nuclear reactor? The whole story seems hushed up by the government? Rumours spreading faster than the disease itself? Public gatherings are banned and schools, universities and the likes are closed? Let's look at this from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influenza and “Swine Flu”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the “usual”, seasonal influenza, but this year there's also the virus strain of H1N1, popularly called “Swine Flu”. Just like &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sars/Pages/Introduction.aspx"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/avian-flu/Pages/Introduction.aspx"&gt;“Avian Influenza”&lt;/a&gt; (the H5N1 strain, emerging in 2003 and still in the wild), it is a zoonosis, an infectious disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans (or vice versa). And just like the “Avian Flu” in 2005 and 2006 made for sensationalist coverage in the media, precipitous actions by various governments and hysterical discussions in the public debate, so is the “Swine Flu” firing everyone's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FARNSWORTH&lt;br&gt;
Dear Lord, they're back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY&lt;br&gt;
We're doomed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERMES&lt;br&gt;
Dooomed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bender takes a breath.]&lt;br&gt;
BENDER&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://doomd.ytmnd.com/"&gt;Doooo...!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the run-of-the-mill variation of the influenza, the yearly seasonal flu “result[s] in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/"&gt;250 000 to 500 000&lt;/a&gt; deaths“ worldwide, whereas the "Swine Flu“ has, to date, taken less than 6300 lives worldwide, &lt;a href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents091104_Influenza_AH1N1_Situation_Report_0900hrs.pdf"&gt;less than 700&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; of those in Europe (this disconnect between victim numbers and media hype is a topic for another day). Funnily enough, very few politicians are recommending to be &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/727"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; (German former Minister of the Interior, now Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has publicly stated that &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/1020/1224257059631.html"&gt;he hasn't decided yet whether or not to get the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Populism and the search for a scapegoat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934946,00.html"&gt;aforementioned case of the Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, the hysteria and fear is coupled with populism: It seems like politicians are adding fuel to the flame in order to score political points ahead of the January elections. Schools and universities are closing, public gatherings have been banned (just days after the big launch of current Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's election campaign), medication was flown in and the landing plane greeted in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished"&gt;George W. Bush-style&lt;/a&gt; photo-op by Tymoshenko – a move so blatantly populist that the local newspapers seem to agree with the political opponent Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who calls this a distraction from the real problems the country is facing. Oh, and on top of all these sweeping measures, Tymoshenko publicly stated that she will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get vaccinated – draw your own conclusions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more exaggerated reaction could be witnessed in Egypt, where – prior to any reported (much less confirmed) cases of “Swine Flu” - &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6193785.ece"&gt;about 250 000 (!) pigs were needlessly slaughtered&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the pigs – and, in a case of guilty-by-association, their Coptic Christian owners -  were presented as a scapegoat. This measure sparked not only riots and the (further) impoverishment of the Coptics11, but also a massive garbage-disposal problem: The Pigs, traditionally used to clean the streets of tons of organic waste are now dearly missed, making the authorities' initial reaction to international criticism during this spring's mass killings even more ironic: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When health officials worldwide said that the virus was not being passed by pigs, the Egyptian government said that the cull was no longer about the flu, but was about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/africa/20cairo.html?_r=3&amp;amp;hp"&gt;cleaning up the zabaleen’s crowded, filthy, neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Parallels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that was a mighty long build-up for a post in the history section of this site, wasn't it?&lt;br&gt;
But reading about all this reminded me of a certain historical topic. Which one? Society's reaction to a truly devastating epidemic of a zoonosis. More specifically: Medieval Europe's reaction to the catastrophe of the Bubonic Plague 1347 – 1351, commonly refered to as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death"&gt;“Black Death”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague, commonly seen as one of the quintessential events in the history of Europe, comparable in its impact to the Migration Period of the Germanic and Slavic peoples or the First and Second World War, has influenced European society in fields as diverse as politics, economy, arts and – of special importance here – mentality&lt;em&gt;[2]&lt;/em&gt;. Some scholars even go so far to call the Plague Years with their estimated 20 - 30 million dead&lt;em&gt;[3]&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. about a third (!) of Europe's inhabitants) the beginning of the end of the Middle Ages&lt;em&gt;[4]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;"sterben [...] von eime ende der welte untz an das ander" - "death […] from one end of the world unto the other"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[5]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The literal reaction to these few years can still be witnessed, stemming from the originals of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boccaccio"&gt;Boccaccio&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes called the Italian Shakespeare) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt; to more modern writers, like &lt;a&gt;Defoe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt;. Even in modern times there are plenty of idioms that can be traced back to this deadly disease: The British and Germans alike may try to "avoid something like the plague" (German: "meiden wie die Pest"), the Germans say they "have the choice between plague and cholera" ("die Wahl zwischen Pest und Cholera") where the English are caught between a rock and a hard place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did the contemporaries react, and where can we draw parallels to our own times? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns of Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into the details of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism"&gt;medieval concepts of health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory_of_disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, let's take a look at the dominant patterns of interpretation of the Plague: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of the 1300's saw a holistic connection between man and environment, microcosm and macrocosm, everyday life and religion, earthly and spiritual life. Therefore, the main topos found in contemporary literature is the "tribunal"&lt;em&gt;[6]&lt;/em&gt; or "God's righteous wrath"[7]. The inexplicable infection mechanism, the rapid and so often fatal progress of the Plague as well as its more general effect on the society at large brought about a plethora of religious phenomena. First and foremost, the flaggelants spring to mind (even though there are instances of earlier flaggelation-movements), often accompanied by antisemitism (although both were mostly limited to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation), the later here functioning as a sort of valve for built-up frustration, as well as serving as a scapegoat (although there were many contributing factors that played out to the Jews' disadvantage and the social elites that instigated these anti-Jewish riots often stood to gain financially from the Jews' demise)&lt;em&gt;[8]&lt;/em&gt;. Less extreme religious tendencies can be witnessed in the increase in pilgrimages as well as the often held services of intercession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But there is a paradox here: Even though the Plague was seen both as sent from God and as righteous punishment for society's sins, the medieval populace still tried to escape the disease by flight, penance and dozens of other actions. Some historians even go so far as to postulate a "scepticism about God's justness"&lt;em&gt;[9]&lt;/em&gt;, as is evident in some chronicles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Genoa, what crime did you commit in these days! Do tell, Sicily, and all you rich islands of the sea, of God's tribunal! Do explain, Venice, Tuscany, and the whole of Italy, how did you conduct yourselves! We from Genoa and Venice try hard to unravel God's resolution! Oh pain! When we sent our fleets against [foreign] towns, we turned on our own homes!&lt;em&gt;[10]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de Mussis cannot explain what, exactly, brought about the Plague's torment, God's tribunal, what is the deed that needs to be paid for. Petrarca even goes so far to ask a question that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should it be true, what some great thinkers already suspected, that God does not care for the earthly world [any more]?&lt;em&gt;[11]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measures taken against the Plague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about the provisions taken against this unprecedented disease, we have to distinguish between the institutions that enacted them: Local authorities, the Catholic Church, and the people themselves. Any ideas that were to be put into practise were not only hampered by the lacking understanding of the Plague itself, but also suffered heavily from the strain the epidemic put on the institutions: Personnel was lacking, civil unrest was spreading and there was little time to react once the first people become infected – and let's not speak of the unreliability of the rule of law even during the best of times in the middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most strain was put on the social networks of the days, the family and the lower clergy. Both were the basic unit of care for the socially weak and ailing, and both suffered horrendously under the Plague: Friends and family did not dare to care for the sick any more, out of fear for their own lives. The lower clergy had even higher casualties than the medical professionals, because they not only supplied basic medical care but also had to administer the last rites&lt;em&gt;[12]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prophylaxis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first organised quarantine likely stems from 1377, even during the Black Death some rudimentary isolation mechanism can be witnessed. On a more basic level, no one wanted to have contact to the fleeing refugees from the already infected neighbouring towns, although the speed of the disease itself makes it seem unlikely that this was a complete or even good isolation: Especially friends and family will likely have breached this informal quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some towns instituted a health check at the gates and refused entry for every sick person – sadly, because of the latent period of the Plague is significantly shorter than the incubation period; since another vector was the flea, this measure usually amounted to nothing. Similarly, the idea of improving municipal hygiene was doomed from the start: All efforts to clean up streets that were not paved, consisted mostly of compacted mud and refuse, were swarming with wild dogs and other animals and literally had streams of shit flowing through it were futile&lt;em&gt;[13]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Counteractive Measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the bodies of those who had died of the Plague were highly infectious, was apparent to most contemporaries. This was evident in the extremely high death rate of the gravediggers and undertakers&lt;em&gt;[14]&lt;/em&gt;. The quick removal of those corpses was often accompanied by an – again, informal – isolation of the deceased's belongings, as simply no one wanted to come into contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burial procedures were shortened and handled less strictly, simply because of the shortage of qualified clergy, but also because fewer people wanted to attend out of fear of infection. Mass graves beyond the city gates were dug, against considerably protest of the local populace who did not approve of the constrains this put on the cult of the death. Sometimes, a maximum number of mourners was set, an obvious but half-hearted parallel to today's banning of public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures were usually accompanied by a host of moral laws, banning gambling, Sunday work or swearing in public; increased pilgrimage and mass could be seen, too. And, most interestingly in my mind, is the medieval equivalent to the modern gagging order of the press: The death knell, used to announce a funeral, was often curbed or banned outright, in order to not agitate the populace any further&lt;em&gt;[15]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, these hysterias are not something that we can point and laugh at in other, supposedly “less educated” or “backwards” countries and times. In Germany, some local school boards have decided to implement a daily head-count of the attending children as a precaution against the “Swine Flu”, some school districts even completely close down whole schools with hundreds of pupils, if just one case of infection is confirmed; &lt;a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video598530.html"&gt;some parents refuse to send their kids to schools (German)&lt;/a&gt; that aren't closed if there is a “Swine Flu” case. And the media is to blame, as well: Germany's biggest tabloid newspaper, &lt;em&gt;“Bild“&lt;/em&gt;, had the &lt;a href="http://www.bildblog.de/13615/schweinegrippe-arbeiten-an-der-hysterie/"&gt;Swine flu (or the vaccination-controversy) as a lead story 12 times in 27 days (German)&lt;/a&gt;; let's just say that serious information probably wasn't the primary concern here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the kind of behaviour witnessed today can be traced back to the medieval times and is, apparently, anchored deep in the human psyche. These kinds of fear – when you worry about your own health as well as about your family – are hard to control by education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: Get vaccinated, if possible against both seasonal as well as “Swine Flu”. Just don't buy into hype (of any kind) and scrutinise the actions taken and the arguments given for them. Otherwise, imagine what kind of panic the future might bring if this thing actually does get dangerous for the whole of society – for there are historical precedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evening all. Two jolly queer stories this week from Dock Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Police in Lampeter spent £20,000 following up tips from psychics in a murder investigation. The suicide verdict was questioned when mediums told the police that a lion, a horse and a man called Tony Fox were important. So off went the Boys In Blue round all the local pubs with Lion or Horse in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police were told that the dead man's ghost had been in touch to say he was strangled by gangsters and forced to drink petrol and bleach. Oddly enough, a second postmortem found no trace of either substance. Tip for mediums: don't make claims that can be disproved in five minutes with a scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dyfed-Powys police said they followed up the leads 'to reassure the family that the full circumstances of the death were as they appeared. Police have a responsibility to the deceased, their family and the public to investigate all deaths thoroughly'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to a point, lads. Going against post mortem evidence does not say a great deal for their trust in forensics either. The men and women in white coats can't be exactly delighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead man had a row with his girlfriend and local news added that 'Their relationship had deteriorated since the birth of their son Luca in 2005, and Miss Edwards, 23, said her former partner had developed bouts of anger. She said Mr Assaf, who had spent six months in jail for assaulting her in 2006, was addicted to amphetamines'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this make the police more or less gullible? Were they fooled by an alleged psychic or were they just doing their job? Could the mediums have been giving them a real tip-off based on facts they were trying to dress up as knowledge from Beyond the Veil for who knows what motive? The police said they had to be sure no third party was involved and someone decided this was worth twenty grand of police time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will never know at what point in the mystic revelations the police decided they'd been had or, in their terms, decided that no third party was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A police source commented: 'We are becoming a laughing stock'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few days later, there was another story, this time about Alan Power, a police trainer with Greater Manchester Police, who is going to court after being sacked because he believes psychics can help in police investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Russell at the Manchester Employment Tribunal said 'I am satisfied that the claimant's beliefs that there is life after death and that the dead can be contacted through mediums are worthy of respect in a democratic society and have sufficient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance to fall into the category of a philosophical belief for the purpose of the 2003 Regulations'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is referring to the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. This is the same law used by Tim Nicholson when he argued that green beliefs are equal to religious beliefs recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's respect for someone's right to believe any old nonsense and then there's taking that nonsense seriously in the workplace, which requires quite a leap especially in a job where lives and safety are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said that a later hearing would have to establish whether Power was 'dismissed for the possession of religious or philosophical beliefs or for his alleged inappropriate foisting of his beliefs on others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power has belonged to a Spiritualist church for 30 years. He told the hearing that he believed in psychics and their 'usefulness to police investigations'. He is to call a psychic he has known since 1980 to testify that his association with the psychic has proved 'detrimental' to his police career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater Manchester Police are going to argue at an appeal that Judge Russell 'erred in law' because Power did not originally claim to have a religious belief, only that he had a belief in psychics and their usefulness to the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must be aware that their public reputation is at stake - something Dyfed-Powys police might like to have considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, is there really any difference between believing that the dead can be contacted and that (fill in any mainstream religious belief of your choice here). If the latter is 'worthy of respect in a democracy', why not the former? What is the difference between praying to a supernatural being to guide you in your investigation, solving the case and ascribing it to His Wisdom and bringing in a psychic? Both are world views based on faith not science, evidence or any testable claim. Both often involve post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, confirmation bias, seeing patterns where there are none and a whole gamut of logical fails, not to mention leaps of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Manchester police do appear to be showing a lot more common sense than the Dyfed-Powys police. The fact that Power wants to prove his beliefs have been detrimental to his career means that he has form, that they have known about him for a while and he went too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Power wins his case, then the floodgates will be open for people with any kind of belief to refuse to do certain work because it is against those beliefs, to bring those beliefs into the workplace, demand concessions or privileges and to appeal if they get sacked. As long as they can prove they didn't just make up a belief on the spot because they fancied a day off, they could have a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two incidents of psychics and police do not make a trend, but it would be interesting to know just how many members of the Force have some sort of supernatural belief that they bring to work with them. There is a Christian Police Association , a Muslim Police Association, a Sikh group and a Pagan Police group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagans wanted to take the Solstices and Halloween off and Hertfordshire police have appointed two pagan police chaplains. A member of Staffordshire Police is a practising Wiccan who has offered to do spells to help his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of all this, does using the dead to grass up the living seem so extreme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, &lt;a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/garrett-decision-to-stop-dam-lauded-as-a-triumph-20091111-i9zx.html"&gt;Australian environmentalists won this battle&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed $1.8 billion Traveston Dam in Queensland has been quashed to protect endangered species, including Mary River turtle and cod, after a landmark decision by the Environment Minister, Peter Garrett.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In explaining his decision yesterday Mr Garrett said the dam would have ''serious and irreversible effects'' on threatened species - which also include the Australian lungfish and the southern barred frog - and he had no option but to reject it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little discombobulating—they actually made a good decision to protect some unique biology? The cynic in me says there has to be some other reason, too, but I&amp;#39;ll take it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/good_news_for_neoceratodus.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/2wDrXNbLuK0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258057884409"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/white_mans_world_locally_made.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aaa104a71f96774c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Featured Artist"/><title type="html">White Man's World: Locally made film of interest</title><published>2009-11-12T19:04:27Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T19:04:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/6ZCl4e9rYUU/white_mans_world_locally_made.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/white_mans_world_locally_made.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below the fold owing to adult themes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/white_mans_world_locally_made.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/white_mans_world_locally_made.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/6ZCl4e9rYUU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258057884409"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/gun_enthusiast_to_be_prosecute.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f92886e371c27115</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gun Ownership"/><title type="html">Gun "enthusiast" to be prosecuted; Regulations changed to allow spot home inspections</title><published>2009-11-12T18:49:28Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T18:49:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/0-d_F1d8-ps/gun_enthusiast_to_be_prosecute.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/gun_enthusiast_to_be_prosecute.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The man owned a virtual arsenal of firearms and ammunition, which was ineffectively secured.  So it was fairly easy for his son, Tim, to arm himself and kill 15 people before turning a weapon on himself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to this horrific act, regulations have been rewritten to allow authorities to inspect gun collections in private homes, unannounced, to make sure they are secured properly.  And now, charges are about to be filed against the gun-owning father. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/gun_enthusiast_to_be_prosecute.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/11/gun_enthusiast_to_be_prosecute.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/0-d_F1d8-ps" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258057325912"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2625">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b64bd49d0794e513</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="Cystic Fibrosis"/><category term="Laurie Edwards"/><category term="Patient Advocates"/><category term="Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia"/><title type="html">Talking Science With Patient Advocates</title><published>2009-11-12T20:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T20:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2625" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.achronicdose.com"&gt;Laurie Edwards&lt;/a&gt; has a rare chronic disease called &lt;a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1002319-overview"&gt;primary ciliary dyskinesia&lt;/a&gt;. Her symptoms are quite similar to those associated with cystic fibrosis, and her young life has been punctuated by numerous hospitalizations, physical limitations and the occasional near-death experience. She is a remarkably upbeat woman, and attributes her self confidence and optimistic outlook to her loving friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie is part of the patient blogging community online. She reads physician blogs with interest, and wants to protect others like her from snake oil and misinformation. She recently interviewed me about my pro-science views for a new book that she’s writing. People like Laurie play a critical role in accurate health communication, and I welcome the chance to discuss science-based medicine with them. Here are some excerpts from our chat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurie: There is a schism between ardent supporters of evidence-based medicine and patients who feel strongly about the value of CAM. Why do you think it is so appealing to patients with chronic illness, despite the lack of research to support it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s really hard to accept the limits of modern medicine. We can’t cure every disease, we can’t effectively treat every symptom, and we can’t prevent death indefinitely. It’s human nature to want to control our destinies, to reject the cards we’ve been dealt. In that sense I have the utmost sympathy for people who choose to turn over every treatment stone in the face of a daunting diagnosis, or when they are suffering from disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we have to recognize how vulnerable we are to snake oil when we are sick. There are entire industries that prey on the ill, offering patients false hope in return for pricey products and procedures. They know that we’ll do anything when we’re suffering, including buying in to a carefully constructed fantasy (often couched in “medical-sounding” jargon). Peddling fake medicine to sick people is morally unjustifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 10+ years of rigorously testing Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the NIH has found no single remedy that has proven effective. However, very few media outlets have had the courage to question the medical value of these therapies (notable exceptions include &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/"&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200025"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/the_ap_shoots_and_scores_again.php"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;). As a physician this disappoints me greatly, because my patients are more likely to get their news from TV than from me. And in an era where Jenny McCarthy is accepted as a medical spokesperson (she encourages moms not to vaccinate their kids), it’s very difficult to empower people with accurate health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the bottom line is this: wanting to fight against disease is a good thing. But the most important battles are won with science. Compassion and kindness are part of good medical care – and CAM is usually no more than an expensive distraction from real cures or acceptance of our physical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurie: On a somewhat related note, what are your thoughts on evidence-based medicine, patient advocacy groups, and the controversy/politics around diagnoses like fibromyalgia and chronic Lyme disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that patient advocacy groups exist because our healthcare system is broken. There are many tragic stories of patients harmed by misdiagnosis, neglect, or layers of bureaucracy – and it’s wonderful that they and their loved ones are fighting so that others don’t share a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, occasionally advocacy groups engage in misplaced passion. They mean to protect and empower others with their actions, but when they rely on false hypotheses to promote their agendas, they can do more harm than good. Take the autism community for example. Of course parents are eager to discover the cause of autism so that it can be treated – but unfortunately, some have simply decided to attribute the cause to something random and unrelated. Vaccines are not the cause of autism – and some advocacy groups have squandered their energy on promoting a theory that is not based on evidence. Imagine how much more useful it would have been to direct that fervor to finding the real cause? Instead, some advocacy groups have whipped everyone into a state of paranoia over a preventive procedure (vaccination) that is one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine. In a parallel universe, scientists have discovered genes associated with autism and we are now beginning to unravel the genetics of the disease. This subject is important to me because I have many relatives with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the fibromyalgia/chronic Lyme controversy is concerned, I think it only highlights how far we are from removing stigma from mental health issues. There is no concrete evidence for a physical cause of fibromyalgia (and many cases of antibody negative Chronic Lyme), and the patients I’ve treated have done well with increased physical activity, anti-depressants, and improved sleep. Why is it important for people with chronic sleep deprivation (with body aches and irritability) to be given the label of “fibromyalgia?” Is it for ease of coding and billing? For destigmatizing a mental health issue? Or for synthesizing symptoms into a syndrome with a name? It’s not important for people to fight about the etiology of the disease – it’s important for people to get the help and support they need to feel better and be more functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurie: Some think the direct-to-consumer advertising and the influence of Big Pharma and “me too” drugs have created a population of patients who are healthier than past generations but don’t feel it—they focus on complaints others might have just ignored. Do you agree with this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s no doubt that advances in medicine have extended and improved our lives. However, we are not seeing the full effect of pharmaceutical benefits since as many as 50% of prescriptions go unfilled or aren’t used correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, for-profit companies that need to please shareholders will behave in predictable ways. That doesn’t bother me so much when widgets are being sold, but when peoples’ lives are in the balance, it’s important to get people the right care, not necessarily the most profitable one. In my opinion, direct-to-consumer marketing has dealt a serious blow to Big Pharma’s credibility. Their true success lies in making good drugs that help people – not in creating false demand for medications that provide only marginal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the untold story is that it’s become so incredibly expensive to discover, research, test, and get FDA approval for game-changing drugs, that Big Pharma’s fall back has become the “me-too” industry. This is resulting in scientific stagnation – and we’re all suffering for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurie: Health care reform is a huge topic right now, and there is much emphasis on prevention and wellness when it comes to diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, etc, where lifestyle changes can make a big difference. Where does this push for prevention leave patients whose outcomes may not necessarily be as impacted by behavioral/lifestyle changes? I’m thinking here of genetic disorders and diseases where disease progression is an issue, but the more common concept of prevention doesn’t apply in the same way. What can we hope for/expect for these patients in terms of health reform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val:&lt;/strong&gt; We have to recognize that &lt;a href="http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/issues/about.cfm"&gt;75% of our healthcare dollars are spent on the treatment and management of chronic disease, and that those diseases are 80% preventable&lt;/a&gt; with diet and lifestyle interventions. Of course, the other 20% are NOT preventable. There will always be people who are injured at random – perhaps by gene mutations (such as cancer), genetic diseases (like Cystic Fibrosis), or even car accidents (spinal cord injuries). It’s important for everyone to recognize that personal choices are not the basis for all disease. Just as we can’t choose our parents, we can’t choose our genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very common for cancer patients to wonder if they did something to bring on their cancer. They become anxious and struggle with guilt. I think that’s really unfortunate because in many cases it’s simply a matter of random chance, mixed with some (potentially unknown) genetic factors. When you think of how many trillions of cells we have in our bodies, and that they’re constantly turning over or making copies of themselves – it’s incredible that there aren’t more errors made in the copying process. Cancer is just a messed up copier situation out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my hope that the government continues to fund research for “orphan” (rare) diseases, and supports insurance coverage for all Americans, especially for those 20% who struggle with chronic disease through no fault of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

Seems the machine gun sneezing started a few weeks ago after she had contracted a cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheerleader is/was most probably suffering psychogenic dystonia after receiving a seasonal flu vaccine in August. And well, my first thought about the sneezing girl was there was probably a strong psychogenic component to her condition as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but with the recent shenanigans of the &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120342404"&gt;Balloon Boy dad&lt;/a&gt;, I’m way more wary of people in bizarre news stories these days. The cynic in me says the sneezing might just be an act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s possible the girl is truly suffering from something unusual. And if the sneezes are real, she is no doubt miserable, and I hope the best for her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what do you think of this girl’s condition? Is there a psychogenic component? Can the nasal membranes be in a constant state of irritation that would cause nonstop sneezing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;- Ernest Hemingway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'Tis the season of the flu, just like every year. But this year, there's something different. How different, you ask? Well, let's take a look at Ukraine:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934946,00.html"&gt;Ukraine is in the midst of what some might call swine-flu hysteria&lt;/a&gt;. The country is in virtual lockdown mode, with the government closing schools, universities and movie theaters and banning all public gatherings until the end of November. Pharmacies have run out of protective masks; those who missed the rush are improvising with scarves or homemade facsimiles. And rumors are running rampant, much as they did during Soviet times when the authorities tried to cover up disasters like the Chernobyl nuclear-plant meltdown. "We are worried that the swine flu has mutated and is killing scores of people," says Nina Sokolovska as she stands in line at a pharmacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flu that seems as deadly as an out-of-control nuclear reactor? The whole story seems hushed up by the government? Rumours spreading faster than the disease itself? Public gatherings are banned and schools, universities and the likes are closed? Let's look at this from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influenza and “Swine Flu”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the “usual”, seasonal influenza, but this year there's also the virus strain of H1N1, popularly called “Swine Flu”. Just like &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sars/Pages/Introduction.aspx"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/avian-flu/Pages/Introduction.aspx"&gt;“Avian Influenza”&lt;/a&gt; (the H5N1 strain, emerging in 2003 and still in the wild), it is a zoonosis, an infectious disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans (or vice versa). And just like the “Avian Flu” in 2005 and 2006 made for sensationalist coverage in the media, precipitous actions by various governments and hysterical discussions in the public debate, so is the “Swine Flu” firing everyone's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FARNSWORTH&lt;br&gt;
Dear Lord, they're back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY&lt;br&gt;
We're doomed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERMES&lt;br&gt;
Dooomed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bender takes a breath.]&lt;br&gt;
BENDER&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://doomd.ytmnd.com/"&gt;Doooo...!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the run-of-the-mill variation of the influenza, the yearly seasonal flu “result[s] in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/"&gt;250 000 to 500 000&lt;/a&gt; deaths“ worldwide, whereas the "Swine Flu“ has, to date, taken less than 6300 lives worldwide, &lt;a href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents091104_Influenza_AH1N1_Situation_Report_0900hrs.pdf"&gt;less than 700&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; of those in Europe (this disconnect between victim numbers and media hype is a topic for another day). Funnily enough, very few politicians are recommending to be &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/727"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; (German former Minister of the Interior, now Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has publicly stated that &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/1020/1224257059631.html"&gt;he hasn't decided yet whether or not to get the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Populism and the search for a scapegoat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934946,00.html"&gt;aforementioned case of the Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, the hysteria and fear is coupled with populism: It seems like politicians are adding fuel to the flame in order to score political points ahead of the January elections. Schools and universities are closing, public gatherings have been banned (just days after the big launch of current Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's election campaign), medication was flown in and the landing plane greeted in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished"&gt;George W. Bush-style&lt;/a&gt; photo-op by Tymoshenko – a move so blatantly populist that the local newspapers seem to agree with the political opponent Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who calls this a distraction from the real problems the country is facing. Oh, and on top of all these sweeping measures, Tymoshenko publicly stated that she will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get vaccinated – draw your own conclusions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more exaggerated reaction could be witnessed in Egypt, where – prior to any reported (much less confirmed) cases of “Swine Flu” - &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6193785.ece"&gt;about 250 000 (!) pigs were needlessly slaughtered&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the pigs – and, in a case of guilty-by-association, their Coptic Christian owners -  were presented as a scapegoat. This measure sparked not only riots and the (further) impoverishment of the Coptics11, but also a massive garbage-disposal problem: The Pigs, traditionally used to clean the streets of tons of organic waste are now dearly missed, making the authorities' initial reaction to international criticism during this spring's mass killings even more ironic: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When health officials worldwide said that the virus was not being passed by pigs, the Egyptian government said that the cull was no longer about the flu, but was about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/africa/20cairo.html?_r=3&amp;amp;hp"&gt;cleaning up the zabaleen’s crowded, filthy, neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Parallels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that was a mighty long build-up for a post in the history section of this site, wasn't it?&lt;br&gt;
But reading about all this reminded me of a certain historical topic. Which one? Society's reaction to a truly devastating epidemic of a zoonosis. More specifically: Medieval Europe's reaction to the catastrophe of the Bubonic Plague 1347 – 1351, commonly refered to as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death"&gt;“Black Death”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague, commonly seen as one of the quintessential events in the history of Europe, comparable in its impact to the Migration Period of the Germanic and Slavic peoples or the First and Second World War, has influenced European society in fields as diverse as politics, economy, arts and – of special importance here – mentality&lt;em&gt;[2]&lt;/em&gt;. Some scholars even go so far to call the Plague Years with their estimated 20 - 30 million dead&lt;em&gt;[3]&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. about a third (!) of Europe's inhabitants) the beginning of the end of the Middle Ages&lt;em&gt;[4]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;"sterben [...] von eime ende der welte untz an das ander" - "death […] from one end of the world unto the other"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[5]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The literal reaction to these few years can still be witnessed, stemming from the originals of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boccaccio"&gt;Boccaccio&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes called the Italian Shakespeare) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt; to more modern writers, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt;. Even in modern times there are plenty of idioms that can be traced back to this deadly disease: The British and Germans alike may try to "avoid something like the plague" (German: "meiden wie die Pest"), the Germans say they "have the choice between plague and cholera" ("die Wahl zwischen Pest und Cholera") where the English are caught between a rock and a hard place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did the contemporaries react, and where can we draw parallels to our own times? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns of Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into the details of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism"&gt;medieval concepts of health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory_of_disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, let's take a look at the dominant patterns of interpretation of the Plague: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of the 1300's saw a holistic connection between man and environment, microcosm and macrocosm, everyday life and religion, earthly and spiritual life. Therefore, the main topos found in contemporary literature is the "tribunal"&lt;em&gt;[6]&lt;/em&gt; or "God's righteous wrath"[7]. The inexplicable infection mechanism, the rapid and so often fatal progress of the Plague as well as its more general effect on the society at large brought about a plethora of religious phenomena. First and foremost, the flaggelants spring to mind (even though there are instances of earlier flaggelation-movements), often accompanied by antisemitism (although both were mostly limited to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation), the later here functioning as a sort of valve for built-up frustration, as well as serving as a scapegoat (although there were many contributing factors that played out to the Jews' disadvantage and the social elites that instigated these anti-Jewish riots often stood to gain financially from the Jews' demise)&lt;em&gt;[8]&lt;/em&gt;. Less extreme religious tendencies can be witnessed in the increase in pilgrimages as well as the often held services of intercession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But there is a paradox here: Even though the Plague was seen both as sent from God and as righteous punishment for society's sins, the medieval populace still tried to escape the disease by flight, penance and dozens of other actions. Some historians even go so far as to postulate a "scepticism about God's justness"&lt;em&gt;[9]&lt;/em&gt;, as is evident in some chronicles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Genoa, what crime did you commit in these days! Do tell, Sicily, and all you rich islands of the sea, of God's tribunal! Do explain, Venice, Tuscany, and the whole of Italy, how did you conduct yourselves! We from Genoa and Venice try hard to unravel God's resolution! Oh pain! When we sent our fleets against [foreign] towns, we turned on our own homes!&lt;em&gt;[10]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de Mussis cannot explain what, exactly, brought about the Plague's torment, God's tribunal, what is the deed that needs to be paid for. Petrarca even goes so far to ask a question that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or should it be true, what some great thinkers already suspected, that God does not care for the earthly world [any more]?&lt;em&gt;[11]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measures taken against the Plague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about the provisions taken against this unprecedented disease, we have to distinguish between the institutions that enacted them: Local authorities, the Catholic Church, and the people themselves. Any ideas that were to be put into practise were not only hampered by the lacking understanding of the Plague itself, but also suffered heavily from the strain the epidemic put on the institutions: Personnel was lacking, civil unrest was spreading and there was little time to react once the first people become infected – and let's not speak of the unreliability of the rule of law even during the best of times in the middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most strain was put on the social networks of the days, the family and the lower clergy. Both were the basic unit of care for the socially weak and ailing, and both suffered horrendously under the Plague: Friends and family did not dare to care for the sick any more, out of fear for their own lives. The lower clergy had even higher casualties than the medical professionals, because they not only supplied basic medical care but also had to administer the last rites&lt;em&gt;[12]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prophylaxis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first organised quarantine likely stems from 1377, even during the Black Death some rudimentary isolation mechanism can be witnessed. On a more basic level, no one wanted to have contact to the fleeing refugees from the already infected neighbouring towns, although the speed of the disease itself makes it seem unlikely that this was a complete or even good isolation: Especially friends and family will likely have breached this informal quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some towns instituted a health check at the gates and refused entry for every sick person – sadly, because of the latent period of the Plague is significantly shorter than the incubation period; since another vector was the flea, this measure usually amounted to nothing. Similarly, the idea of improving municipal hygiene was doomed from the start: All efforts to clean up streets that were not paved, consisted mostly of compacted mud and refuse, were swarming with wild dogs and other animals and literally had streams of shit flowing through it were futile&lt;em&gt;[13]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Counteractive Measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the bodies of those who had died of the Plague were highly infectious, was apparent to most contemporaries. This was evident in the extremely high death rate of the gravediggers and undertakers&lt;em&gt;[14]&lt;/em&gt;. The quick removal of those corpses was often accompanied by an – again, informal – isolation of the deceased's belongings, as simply no one wanted to come into contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burial procedures were shortened and handled less strictly, simply because of the shortage of qualified clergy, but also because fewer people wanted to attend out of fear of infection. Mass graves beyond the city gates were dug, against considerably protest of the local populace who did not approve of the constrains this put on the cult of the death. Sometimes, a maximum number of mourners was set, an obvious but half-hearted parallel to today's banning of public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures were usually accompanied by a host of moral laws, banning gambling, Sunday work or swearing in public; increased pilgrimage and mass could be seen, too. And, most interestingly in my mind, is the medieval equivalent to the modern gagging order of the press: The death knell, used to announce a funeral, was often curbed or banned outright, in order to not agitate the populace any further&lt;em&gt;[15]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, these hysterias are not something that we can point and laugh at in other, supposedly “less educated” or “backwards” countries and times. In Germany, some local school boards have decided to implement a daily head-count of the attending children as a precaution against the “Swine Flu”, some school districts even completely close down whole schools with hundreds of pupils, if just one case of infection is confirmed; &lt;a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video598530.html"&gt;some parents refuse to send their kids to schools (German)&lt;/a&gt; that aren't closed if there is a “Swine Flu” case. And the media is to blame, as well: Germany's biggest tabloid newspaper, &lt;em&gt;“Bild“&lt;/em&gt;, had the &lt;a href="http://www.bildblog.de/13615/schweinegrippe-arbeiten-an-der-hysterie/"&gt;Swine flu (or the vaccination-controversy) as a lead story 12 times in 27 days (German)&lt;/a&gt;; let's just say that serious information probably wasn't the primary concern here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the kind of behaviour witnessed today can be traced back to the medieval times and is, apparently, anchored deep in the human psyche. These kinds of fear – when you worry about your own health as well as about your family – are hard to control by education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: Get vaccinated, if possible against both seasonal as well as “Swine Flu”. Just don't buy into hype (of any kind) and scrutinise the actions taken and the arguments given for them. Otherwise, imagine what kind of panic the future might bring if this thing actually does get dangerous for the whole of society – for there are historical precedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evening all. Two jolly queer stories this week from Dock Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/06/police-psychic-leads-death-ghost"&gt;Police in Lampeter spent £20,000 following up tips from psychics&lt;/a&gt; in a murder investigation. The suicide verdict was questioned when mediums told the police that a lion, a horse and a man called Tony Fox were important. So off went the Boys In Blue round all the local pubs with Lion or Horse in the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police were told that the dead man's ghost had been in touch to say he was strangled by gangsters and forced to drink petrol and bleach. Oddly enough, a second postmortem found no trace of either substance. Tip for mediums: don't make claims that can be disproved in five minutes with a scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dyfed-Powys police said they followed up the leads 'to reassure the family that the full circumstances of the death were as they appeared. Police have a responsibility to the deceased, their family and the public to investigate all deaths thoroughly'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to a point, lads. Going against post mortem evidence does not say a great deal for their trust in forensics either. The men and women in white coats can't be exactly delighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead man had a row with his girlfriend and local news added that 'Their relationship had deteriorated since the birth of their son Luca in 2005, and Miss Edwards, 23, said her former partner had developed bouts of anger. She said Mr Assaf, who had spent six months in jail for assaulting her in 2006, was addicted to amphetamines'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this make the police more or less gullible? Were they fooled by an alleged psychic or were they just doing their job? Could the mediums have been giving them a real tip-off based on facts they were trying to dress up as knowledge from Beyond the Veil for who knows what motive? The police said they had to be sure no third party was involved and someone decided this was worth twenty grand of police time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will never know at what point in the mystic revelations the police decided they'd been had or, in their terms, decided that no third party was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A police source commented: 'We are becoming a laughing stock'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few days later, there was another story, this time about Alan Power, a police trainer with Greater Manchester Police, who is going to court after being sacked because he believes psychics can help in police investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Russell at the Manchester Employment Tribunal said 'I am satisfied that the claimant's beliefs that there is life after death and that the dead can be contacted through mediums are worthy of respect in a democratic society and have sufficient cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance to fall into the category of a philosophical belief for the purpose of the 2003 Regulations'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is referring to the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. This is the same law used by Tim Nicholson when he argued that green beliefs are equal to religious beliefs recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's respect for someone's right to believe any old nonsense and then there's taking that nonsense seriously in the workplace, which requires quite a leap especially in a job where lives and safety are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said that a later hearing would have to establish whether Power was 'dismissed for the possession of religious or philosophical beliefs or for his alleged inappropriate foisting of his beliefs on others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power has belonged to a Spiritualist church for 30 years. He told the hearing that he believed in psychics and their 'usefulness to police investigations'. He is to call a psychic he has known since 1980 to testify that his association with the psychic has proved 'detrimental' to his police career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater Manchester Police are going to argue at an appeal that Judge Russell 'erred in law' because Power did not originally claim to have a religious belief, only that he had a belief in psychics and their usefulness to the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must be aware that their public reputation is at stake - something Dyfed-Powys police might like to have considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, is there really any difference between believing that the dead can be contacted and that (fill in any mainstream religious belief of your choice here). If the latter is 'worthy of respect in a democracy', why not the former? What is the difference between praying to a supernatural being to guide you in your investigation, solving the case and ascribing it to His Wisdom and bringing in a psychic? Both are world views based on faith not science, evidence or any testable claim. Both often involve post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, confirmation bias, seeing patterns where there are none and a whole gamut of logical fails, not to mention leaps of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Manchester police do appear to be showing a lot more common sense than the Dyfed-Powys police. The fact that Power wants to prove his beliefs have been detrimental to his career means that he has form, that they have known about him for a while and he went too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Power wins his case, then the floodgates will be open for people with any kind of belief to refuse to do certain work because it is against those beliefs, to bring those beliefs into the workplace, demand concessions or privileges and to appeal if they get sacked. As long as they can prove they didn't just make up a belief on the spot because they fancied a day off, they could have a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two incidents of psychics and police do not make a trend, but it would be interesting to know just how many members of the Force have some sort of supernatural belief that they bring to work with them. There is a Christian Police Association , a Muslim Police Association, a Sikh group and a Pagan Police group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagans wanted to take the Solstices and Halloween off and Hertfordshire police have appointed two pagan police chaplains. A member of Staffordshire Police is a practising Wiccan who has offered to do spells to help his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of all this, does using the dead to grass up the living seem so extreme?&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, there's another factor that seems to be getting minimized in the press accounts: he was also a member of an Abrahamic death cult. &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_releases_statement_from_ibn_warraq_in_response_to_fort_hood_tragedy/"&gt;Ibn Warraq has come out with a strong statement on the Islamic terrorism that motivated the attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to abandon apologetics, and political correctness. Not all Muslims are terrorists. Not all Muslims are implicated in the horrendous events of September 11, 2001 -- or of November 5, 2009. However, to pretend that Islam has nothing to do with 9/11 or the Fort Hood massacre is willfully to ignore the obvious. To leave Islam out of the equation means to forever misinterpret events. Without Islam, the long-term strategy and individual acts of violence by Osama bin Laden and his followers make little sense. Without Islam, the West will go on being incapable of understanding our terrorist enemies, and hence will be incapable to deal with them. Without Islam, neither is it possible to comprehend the barbarism of the Taliban, the position of women and non-Muslims in Islamic countries, or -- now-- the murders attributed to Major Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion is not a mitigating factor. It is not an excuse or a defense. it is not a sacred principle that must not be questioned. Too often, it has a complex &lt;i&gt;causal&lt;/i&gt; relationship to evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/cfi_on_the_fort_hood_murders.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/x2i1HvbLOYQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258053812183"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/catholic_priorities_must_be_ma.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6f2a458678afa8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Catholic priorities must be maintained!</title><published>2009-11-12T17:57:41Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T17:57:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8qbxjVIbPV8/catholic_priorities_must_be_ma.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/catholic_priorities_must_be_ma.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Archdiocese of Washington said Wednesday that it will be unable to continue the social service programs it runs for the District if the city doesn't change a proposed same-sex marriage law, a threat that could affect tens of thousands of people the church helps with adoption, homelessness and health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church weighs the lives of tens of thousands of sick, homeless people against the chance to slap down the dignity of gay people again, and &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; the most important thing is to make sure the primacy of heterosexuality is preserved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/catholic_priorities_must_be_ma.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8qbxjVIbPV8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258053812182"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/dont_die_gay_in_ri.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ceafdb2ac236493</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Equality"/><title type="html">Don't die gay in R.I.</title><published>2009-11-12T17:43:58Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T17:43:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/PfLllOYHriQ/dont_die_gay_in_ri.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/dont_die_gay_in_ri.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I find it hard to believe how callous these conservative politicians can be.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These programs are largely unregulated, and are frequently staffed with poorly-trained and poorly-supervised workers from the surrounding communities. The programs tend to be in rural, high-unemployment areas.  Many (if not most) have used &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/landmark/landmark49.html"&gt;Large Group Awareness Training&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (LGAT) methods in their programs (see below).  Many of the children enrolled in such programs have co-occuring conditions such as ADHD, learning disabilities such as dyslexia, Asperger&amp;#39;s syndrome, or psychiatric conditions such as depression or bipolar disorder.  The programs do not have a research base in addressing the issues raised by the students&amp;#39; co-occuring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2009/11/prineville_boarding_school_to.html"&gt;the Oregonian

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mount Bachelor Academy (MBA), a Prineville boarding school investigated by the state for allegations of child abuse, will close by December 9.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The facility will start letting employees go on Wednesday, with a total loss of between 69 and 72 jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The state Department of Human Services told parents to remove their children from the school last week after a seven-month investigation concluded that students were subject to inappropriate sexual role-play, public humiliation and physical deprivation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

The &amp;quot;inappropriate sexual role-play public humiliation and physical deprivation&amp;quot; are all characteristic of the LGAT format of  CEDU.  The LGAT format used by MBA was renamed &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://wiki.fornits.com/index.php?title=Lifestep"&gt;Lifestep&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mount Bachelor Academy, &lt;a href="http://www.welcomemba.com/mbahistory.htm"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;, was founded in 1987 by Linda Houghton with financial backing from Barry Weiss of College Health Services.  Houghton had been on the staff at CEDU and brought the CEDU LGAT model to Mount Bachelor.  Eventually Mount Batchelor became part of the &lt;a href="http://www.aspeneducation.com/"&gt;Aspen Education Group,&lt;/a&gt; a for-profit chain of programs for &amp;quot;troubled teens&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, some parts of the Aspen Group developed reservations about the LGAT form of &amp;quot;emotional growth&amp;quot;, the mainstay of many Aspen program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.strugglingteens.com/artman/publish/article_5437.shtml"&gt;Academy at Swift River Team To Discuss New Developments And Applications
Of Psychodrama At Miami Independent Educational Consultants Association (IECA) workshop Entitled: &amp;quot;Lifesteps or Mis-steps?&amp;quot;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The emotional growth schools that emerged in the 1960&amp;#39;s incorporated a number of expressive therapy techniques and experiential methods that were &amp;quot;popular&amp;quot; in the 1960&amp;#39;s and 70&amp;#39;s such as marathon, encounter groups, and psychodrama. Emotional growth schools recognize the role of feeling and powerful, here-and-now experiences for adolescents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Advances, however, in our understanding of trauma, the adolescent brain and disorders of affect regulation have correspondingly led to more judicious applications of expressive therapies. These understandings have played a key role in Swift River&amp;#39;s implementation of an evidenced based clinical model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The label from &amp;quot;Lifesteps&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;psychodrama&amp;quot; may have changed, but the abusive conditions go on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &amp;quot;Troubled Teen Help&amp;quot; website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troubledteenhelp.com/pr_MountBachelorAcademy_11100902"&gt;Current statement from Sharon Bitz, Executive Director of Mount Bachelor Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s action last Monday was deeply disappointing to Mount Bachelor Academy after all of our cooperative efforts these past months. We intend to do everything possible to defend the excellent record of our staff of dedicated professionals built over more than 20 years at Mount Bachelor, and to refute these erroneous allegations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;We are told that the state’s order to suspend operations at Mount Bachelor was largely based on a 200-page report that we still have not been given. However, from what we read in the media, it appears that the report includes allegations that date back as far as 10 to 12 years, many of which were based on a prior treatment process that was overhauled in 2002.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1891082,00.html"&gt;April Time Magazine story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We feel very strongly that for-profit residential facilities are
completely inappropriate for special education. They have been shown to
be ineffective and commonly employ practices that do harm,&amp;quot; says Alison
Barkoff, senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health
Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="border:medium none;overflow:hidden;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;text-align:left;text-decoration:none"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1891082,00.html#ixzz0WflJnyYp"&gt;http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1891082,00.html#ixzz0WflJnyYp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

A slider along the bottom (or just running your mouse left/right on the graphic itself) changes the scale, so zoom in and out on the objects. You fly past a mitochondrion, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, all the way down to a carbon atom. The sizes are given too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/scale/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/carbonslider.jpg" alt="carbonslider" title="carbonslider" width="490" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty slick, and helpful; people (me included) tend to have a miserable sense of scale. If I had two wishes for this, it would be that they included a human hair, since that’s something of a standard for comparison to small things (a hair is 50 – 100 microns in diameter), and that they make the opposite one to zoom out from a coffee bean to the observable Universe. That would be pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

Our book is described as ‘a call to action,’ while Dean’s details how to achieve results. Here’s an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientific discoveries conflict with either our religious beliefs or personal prerogatives (as when climatologists point out that our lifestyles are straining the limits of our planet’s resources), we find them easy to ignore or dismiss. Our minds have not been molded to respect the scientific process nor to take the warnings of its practitioners seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new books approach this dilemma from different perspectives. In &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future&lt;/em&gt; (Basic Books; $24), Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum provide a detailed diagnosis of the problem and how it developed over the decades. In &lt;em&gt;Am I Making Myself Clear?&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard University Press; $19.95), Cornelia Dean offers practical advice to researchers who are interested in making things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can only hope that researchers — and the academic administrators who decide what the scientists of tomorrow need to know — read these concise, sharply written volumes and take their message to heart. The process of reconnecting science and society cannot start soon enough. Presuming the climatologists are correct, our planet and the species that live on it are in a lot of trouble if we don’t start taking science seriously soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/S1051621-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://unitedcor.org/images/S1051621-1.jpg" title="CinCor" width="512" height="384"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait… what’s that?  A crane?  Yep.  They &lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/20091112.htm"&gt;took it down this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Around 2:00 PM yesterday, the United Coalition of Reason, which paid $3,875.00 for a one-month run of the billboard, was contacted byLamar Advertising of Cincinnati. Lamar reported that the landowner of the site had been threatened over the billboard’s message and wanted it taken down. Lamar only leases the land the billboard stands on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word on who made the threat or what the threat was, but Lamar handled this exactly as they should have.  They took down the message and moved it to another location — seemingly, a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; location — at no extra charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/S1051642-new2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://unitedcor.org/images/S1051642-new2.jpg" title="CinCoR2" width="512" height="384"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some good to come from all this: More publicity for the atheist groups in Cincinnati and the fact that no one was harmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person of faith in the city should be on the Coalition’s side in this matter — that is, they should be saying that there’s nothing offensive in the message itself, which simply says people who don’t beleive in God are not alone.  Furthermore, they should condemn the anonymous person who made this threat.  They should tell their churchgoers that they support our right to free speech even if they may not agree with what we believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason they should be distancing themselves from this matter.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pigliucci is the chair of the Department of Philosophy at Lehman College. He is known as an outspoken critic of creationism and advocate of science education. He writes regularly for Skeptical Inquirer and Philosophy Now and maintains a blog called “Rationally Speaking.” He has debated creationists and intelligent design proponents, including Duane Gish, Kent Hovind, William Dembski and Jonathan Wells, on many occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also speaking on Saturday, Nov 14th, and Kennesaw State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have the BIG room reserved for the 13th. Not the one we normally meet in — that wall will be removed and we’ll have that whole space. It should be a lot more fun than anything you already had planned for Friday night. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: Friday, November 13, 8:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: &lt;a href="http://www.manuelstavern.com/"&gt;Manuel’s Tavern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I immediately got my camera ready and snapped the object which was then two to three feet above the surface of the water. I did not see any head, for what I took to be the front parts were under the water,  but there was considerable movement from what seemed to be the tail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, seen below, was the very first photograph of the legendary Loch Ness monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/hughgray1933.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cannot give any definate opinion of size, except that it was very great - it was a dark greyish color; the skin was glistening and appeared smooth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early 1930s saw a new road built along the side of Loch Ness, and as the legend spread sightings of the beastie sky-rocketed. In 1934, the most famous photograph of all was taken by Robert Wilson. Sadly &lt;a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/nessie.html"&gt;this was a hoax&lt;/a&gt;; a toy submarine outfitted with a fake serpent's head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legend has persisted to this day, with the 22 square mile lake believed by many - including tourists and canny locals with good business acument - to harbour some relic of the dinosaur age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2003, a BBC team &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3096839.stm"&gt;put paid to the idea completely&lt;/a&gt;. They used GPS and several hundred sonar beams to scan every cubic foot of the Loch, and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We went from shoreline to shoreline, top to bottom on this one, we have covered everything in this loch and we saw no signs of any large living animal in the loch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC project went further, and revealed a fascinating insight into the psychology of our relationship with the Loch Ness Monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC team says the only explanation for the persistence of the myth of the monster is that people see what they want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this, the researchers hid a fence post beneath the surface of the loch and raised it in front of a coach party of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewed afterwards, most said they had observed a square object but several drew monster-shaped heads when asked to sketch what they had seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to believe, we really do. As a scientist and a skeptic I'm driven by the need for answers, but sometimes I find myself looking back to the Victorian age and mourning the mysteries that have been solved. In the modern world of lasers and sonar and GPS, there are few corners left for creatures like Nessie to exist. Mythological creatures are following their real-life cousins and becoming extinct, and when we lose them I think the world will be a slightly sadder place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder, if we ever leave leave this Earth and explore and colonize other planets, will our descendants create their own, new monsters? I'd like to think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Ariane Sherine, there's probably no Loch Ness Monster, but there is one aspect of the legend that is real, and is truly remarkable. Conservapedia &lt;a href="http://conservapedia.com/Loch_Ness_monster"&gt;have an entry for the Loch Ness Monster&lt;/a&gt;, which is reasonably well-written and doesn't mention gays, Muslims or atheists once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you believe it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was a poor choice of name because it will be very hard to google "go."  In fact, Google won't let you google "go" by default because it is one of the SLWs (stupid little words) that Google prefers to pretend does not exist (I assume, possibly wrongly).

&lt;p&gt;They re-chalked.  It got re-erased.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cycle and the reaction to it earned the group &lt;a href="http://www.cw.ua.edu/aaa-continues-with-activities-after-chalking-1.2061286"&gt;lots of great publicity&lt;/a&gt;.  And now, they’re able to spread their message to a larger audience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[AAA president Sam] Arnold said AAA’s mission has two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to create a social hub for secular students,” Arnold said. “We also want to increase awareness and acceptance of nonreligious worldviews in the UA community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caitlin McClusky, a sophomore majoring in anthropology and a member of AAA, said she joined to be with people with similar views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been agnostic all my life, and I’ve been in Alabama all my life, and it’s been pretty hard,” McClusky said. “It’s really important to have something like this in a university setting and have discourse on this. People need to know it’s okay.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAA’s first speaker of the year — &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=317902180067&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;Professor Kevin Kukla summarizing the history of Creationist arguments&lt;/a&gt; — is this Sunday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping they draw a capacity crowd.&lt;br&gt;

The same week, a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2215"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Novella at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; discussed the recently published "Therapeutic effects of magnetic and copper bracelets in osteoarthritis: A randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial" from &lt;em&gt;Complementary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Therapies in Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WCS-4X3MR5C-1&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=9e223ccbee8abd610af615b5cf993a60"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt;), which documented a controlled test on the efficacy of magnetic or copper bracelets to help arthritis and other ailments. Unsurprisingly, any benefits from the different bracelets were no better than placebo. Readers are referred to his excellent write-up for a discussion of the study and links to other peer-reviewed work. In it, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a dollar-sucking entity foisted on the taxpayers by Congress, admits that it has found no evidence for beneficial effects on fibromyalgia, migraines, or other painful conditions, from the use of metal bracelets. The idea of people volunteering to put large amounts of metal and metal solutions into their bodies intrigued me, so I reviewed the current state of Metal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A couple years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22536241/"&gt;Paul Karason&lt;/a&gt; became briefly famous as the "blue man" whose skin turned blue due to argyria -- a condition where silver collects in the skin and organs and reacts with light, much as the silver emulsion on film. He dosed himself with silver solutions that he created in his home, a procedure easy for anyone who has taken a basic high school chemistry class. "I did it all on my own," he said. "Originally, I just saw an ad for a colloidal silver generator in a magazine and the picture stuck in my head like a song might stick in your head. I had a friend who had severe petroleum poisoning, and I heard colloidal silver was helpful for that, and that's how I started." In the same interview, he admitted that his original health problem, dermatitis, was not cured by ingesting silver, although he continued to drink silver solutions daily. Proponents of colloidal silver claim that ingesting silver can cure or treat colds, flu, cancer, diabetes, herpes, shingles, and HIV/AIDS, among other ailments. Silver solutions, such as silver nitrate, have been used as anti-microbial disinfectants for many years, and frequently used as eyedrops for newborns to prevent conjunctivitis (although most former uses have been supplanted by newer, less toxic treatments). The FDA has repeatedly stated that ingesting silver is not beneficial, is not even safe, and can cause kidney damage.</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Naomi Baker)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258042240553"><id gr:original-id="764 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/31f295ed812e4d0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conservapedia" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/44"/><category term="legend" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1056"/><category term="loch ness monster" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1055"/><category term="monsters" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1057"/><category term="myth" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/89"/><category term="Scotland" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/945"/><category term="Natural World" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/science/natural-world"/><category term="Subfeature" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/977"/><title type="html">Happy Birthday to the Loch Ness Monster</title><published>2009-11-12T13:33:15Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T13:33:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/764" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Seventy-six years ago today, on November 12th 1933, Hugh Gray was walking back from chuch along the shores of Loch Ness when he saw an &lt;em&gt;"object of considerable dimensions—making a big splash with spray on the surface."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I immediately got my camera ready and snapped the object which was then two to three feet above the surface of the water. I did not see any head, for what I took to be the front parts were under the water,  but there was considerable movement from what seemed to be the tail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, seen below, was the very first photograph of the legendary Loch Ness monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/hughgray1933.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cannot give any definate opinion of size, except that it was very great - it was a dark greyish color; the skin was glistening and appeared smooth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early 1930s saw a new road built along the side of Loch Ness, and as the legend spread sightings of the beastie sky-rocketed. In 1934, the most famous photograph of all was taken by Robert Wilson. Sadly &lt;a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/nessie.html"&gt;this was a hoax&lt;/a&gt;; a toy submarine outfitted with a fake serpent's head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/lochness.jpg" align="right" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And let me say, if you’re like me and love action-packed Hollywood world-enders, then you don’t want to miss this one. It is even bigger and better and crazier and more decadent than Emmerich’s &lt;em&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;argument about how Hollywood depictions have hurt the place of science in our culture, I couldn’t help analyzing this film through that lens (once I finished suspending my disbelief, anyway). And I have to say, &lt;em&gt;2012 &lt;/em&gt;presents the latest evidence that anti-science sentiment in Hollywood is really declining: We’re seeing a lot fewer mad scientists in major Hollywood films today, and a lot more scientist heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;2012&lt;/em&gt;, the hero is Adrian Helmsley (&lt;a title="Chiwetel Ejiofor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor"&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor&lt;/a&gt;) who is–and this cracked me up–a “deputy geologist” at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Well, at least they got the office name right, though geologists have their &lt;a href="http://www.usgs.gov/"&gt;own agency&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Helmsley becomes the top science adviser to the president. And for good reason: He is the guy who makes the US government wake up and see the catastrophe that is coming; he is the guy who runs the models to try to figure out just when it will arrive and how bad it will be–even though these models aren’t perfect and often have to be revised, always in the it’s-even-worse direction (an interesting analogy with climate change models).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmsley’s virtue–a uniquely scientific one–lies in the fact that he fully and honestly admits as much. In one moment that anybody who cares about science in policy will love, Helmsley explains one of these recalculations to POTUS (Danny Glover) in the Oval Office, and admits, “I was wrong.” The president replies (these are not his exact words) “That’s the first time anybody has ever said that in this office.” Yup, that’s the virtue of having scientists in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, granted, even as &lt;em&gt;2012&lt;/em&gt; idolizes scientists as truth tellers and civilization-savers, the scientific plot of the movie is not only bizarre but was, to me, incomprehensible. If I had only understood it better–something about solar neutrinos transforming into some other kind of particle at the center of the Earth, thus destabilizing the crust, causing everything to move, unleashing supervolcanos and tsunamis and gigantic earthquakes that rip continents asunder–I’m sure I would consider it rankly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, that’s the new pro-science Hollywood for you. Don’t expect their sci-fi plots to be firmly grounded in events that could actually happen. But lay that care aside, and watch as they turn scientists into leaders and role-models for the next generation of U.S. children. In the end, I think the latter is far more important than any mere quibble over what it takes to produce a mass entertainment spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I immediately got my camera ready and snapped the object which was then two to three feet above the surface of the water. I did not see any head, for what I took to be the front parts were under the water,  but there was considerable movement from what seemed to be the tail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, seen below, was the very first photograph of the legendary Loch Ness monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/hughgray1933.jpg" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cannot give any definate opinion of size, except that it was very great - it was a dark greyish color; the skin was glistening and appeared smooth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early 1930s saw a new road built along the side of Loch Ness, and as the legend spread sightings of the beastie sky-rocketed. In 1934, the most famous photograph of all was taken by Robert Wilson. Sadly &lt;a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/nessie.html"&gt;this was a hoax&lt;/a&gt;; a toy submarine outfitted with a fake serpent's head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/lochness.jpg" align="right" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legend has persisted to this day, with the 22 square mile lake believed by many - including tourists and canny locals with good business acument - to harbour some relic of the dinosaur age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2003, a BBC team &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3096839.stm"&gt;put paid to the idea completely&lt;/a&gt;. They used GPS and several hundred sonar beams to scan every cubic foot of the Loch, and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We went from shoreline to shoreline, top to bottom on this one, we have covered everything in this loch and we saw no signs of any large living animal in the loch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC project went further, and revealed a fascinating insight into the psychology of our relationship with the Loch Ness Monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC team says the only explanation for the persistence of the myth of the monster is that people see what they want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this, the researchers hid a fence post beneath the surface of the loch and raised it in front of a coach party of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewed afterwards, most said they had observed a square object but several drew monster-shaped heads when asked to sketch what they had seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to believe, we really do. As a scientist and a skeptic I'm driven by the need for answers, but sometimes I find myself looking back to the Victorian age and mourning the mysteries that have been solved. In the modern world of lasers and sonar and GPS, there are few corners left for creatures like Nessie to exist. Mythological creatures are following their real-life cousins and becoming extinct, and when we lose them I think the world will be a slightly sadder place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder, if we ever leave leave this Earth and explore and colonize other planets, will our descendants create their own, new monsters? I'd like to think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Ariane Sherine, there's probably no Loch Ness Monster, but there is one aspect of the legend that is real, and is truly remarkable. Conservapedia &lt;a href="http://conservapedia.com/Loch_Ness_monster"&gt;have an entry for the Loch Ness Monster&lt;/a&gt;, which is reasonably well-written and doesn't mention gays, Muslims or atheists once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you believe it? &lt;/p&gt;

A farrowing crate is a cage that confines a lactating sow. Its dimensions are tight - a typical crate enables a mother pig to move a few inches in any direction.

A crated pig can do little more than lie on her side, position her nipples in the right direction, and provide mother's milk to her piglets on the other end of prison-like bars. Some farmers deem this confined arrangement the cruelest manifestation of factory farming.

It's not hard to see why.</summary><author><name>By JAMES MCWILLIAMS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258039225546"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=6780">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/939fdea2bda517af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Apollo"/><category term="Bart Sibrel"/><category term="Craig Ferguson"/><title type="html">Craig Ferguson takes on the Apollo deniers</title><published>2009-11-12T15:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T15:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/12/craig-ferguson-takes-on-the-apollo-deniers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I posted about Adam and Jamie on Craig Ferguson’s TV show.

During the preceding post (Part-3) the phenotypes of two such fire-born species, the longleaf and slash pines, were detailed as exemplars of organisms with traits that not only aid in defending against heat and flame, but also as species that exhibit specific physical structures, chemicals and behaviors that could intrinsically promote fire. In closing that previous discussion, consideration was given to the possible motives behind the longleaf and slash pine’s ability to deliberately provoke fire.

But, there may also be several other less optimal means of gathering similar data, and one of those may be much more feasible than the totally optimal method. As a scientist, you have to determine whether this other method is sufficient, or whether it's necessary to expend the extra effort and/or resources on the more difficult method. Sometimes it's totally fine to take the simpler approach (and this will spare some of your precious time and your lab's precious funding), but this post is about a case where it's not.

My colleagues and I have a new paper in JBC (the Journal of Biological Chemistry) that went online late last month. Although I think that the science is pretty interesting, I'm not going to write at length about it here. Instead, you should check out my post about an earlier paper on this subject (integrin phosphorylation) here. Superficially, the two are reasonably similar (at least on the level that I would discuss things on the blog). In fact, much of the newly published work was was actually conducted around the same time as the earlier work (a few years ago), but for a variety of reasons we didn't publish it then. The new paper marks a major advancement of that work, and the new biological data from Jake Haling (in Mark Ginsberg's lab at UCSD) also increases its depth considerably.

However, what I want to write about here is how one goes about studying tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine is one of the 20 amino acids that form the building blocks of the proteins in our bodies. Proteins are often modified after they are produced in the body, and one type of modification is phosphorylation (the addition of a phosphate group to the -OH group of serine, threonine, or tyrosine, i.e. changing -OH to -PO42-). This modification is catalyzed by a type of enzyme called a kinase, and phosphorylation is a type of "posttranslational modification" because it occurs after the mRNA has been translated into a chain of amino acids (i.e. a protein).

That&amp;#39;s according to Andrew Ellis and colleagues, whose new research shows that the classic &amp;quot;age-of-acquisition&amp;quot; effect in psychology applies to brand names as much as it does to everyday words.Ellis&amp;#39;s team found that student participants were quicker to recognise brand names they had encountered from birth. This was demonstrated by presenting students with a range of real and fictional brand names and asking them to indicate as quickly as possible whether a brand was real. If a brand had been experienced from birth, the students were quicker to recognise it as real than if it had been encountered from age five and up. A second experiment showed that students were also quicker at accessing information about early encountered brands compared with late-encountered brands, as indicated by the speed with which they said a product was or was not made by a given brand.These findings resemble classic &amp;quot;age-of-acquisition&amp;quot; effects, in which people are more proficient at processing words they encountered earlier in life. Research has shown that this effect is not explainable purely in terms of greater cumulative exposure to early encountered words. One alternative proposal is that words (and presumably brands too) encountered early in life shape the maturing brain in such a way that a life-long advantage is maintained for processing those early words. Ellis&amp;#39;s team&amp;#39;s final experiment was perhaps the most striking. In this case, participants aged between 50 and 83 years were quicker to recognise early brands over newer, current brands, even if the early brands were long since defunct.Combined with prior research showing that people generally feel more favourable towards words and pictures that they find easier to process - a phenomenon called the &amp;quot;fluency effect&amp;quot; - Ellis and his colleagues said their findings have serious implications for brand success. &amp;quot;The evidence suggests that mere exposure to brands in childhood will make for more fluent recognition of those brand names in adulthood that will persist through to old age,&amp;quot; they said.The Digest asked the researchers for some examples of the brands used in the research but they&amp;#39;ve been sworn to secrecy by their sponsors, Unilever, for reasons of commercial sensitivity._________________________________Ellis, A., Holmes, S., &amp;amp; Wright, R.

The motion: &lt;em&gt;"The Catholic Church is a force for good in the world"&lt;/em&gt; was supported by Anne Widdecombe MP and Archbishop John Onaiyekan and most eloquently and deftly opposed by Archatheist Christopher Hitches and National Treasure, Stephen Fry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have seen the video or read the reports you will already know that it was a complete rout for the Enlightenment with Widdecombe and Onaiyekan receiving a damn good verbal kicking. A boxing referee may well have shown pity and called a halt to the proceedings after round 2, but Zeinab Badawi allowed the punch drunk Catholics to cling on to the ropes for the duration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was of course, delighted to hear Hitchens and Fry drawing attention to the  long list of unequivocal harm proliferated and condoned by the Catholic Church, both in its long history and indeed now. And I was of course unsurprised that the Catholic apologists where unable to justify the inhumane actions of their Church and disappointed that they were also unwilling to apologise for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a resounding victory for free thought in the final vote of the evening, I wanted to ensure that the one positive point offered by Widdecombe and Onaiyekan was not simply ignored in the heat of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument put forward from the Catholic camp to support the motion was the undeniable massive amount of much needed aid and charity supplied by the Church. However, before looking at this, allow me to backtrack a few hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the church had a complete strangle hold on society, it was free to bolster its numbers in foreign parts and spread the good word with a good old fashioned Crusade. Thankfully, in these enlightened times the majority of us can see the immorality in such an approach. If however the term Crusade still holds a little romance for you, try substituting it for Jihad, as its true meaning is much clearer when not blurred by you own particular belief system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually replacing crusades with missionary work seemed to provide a more acceptable non-violent evangelism for spreading the gospel to those not fortunate enough to have been born into the one true faith. Although once again with modern eyes we can see how breaking Star Trek’s prime directive is not especially wise, and interfering with local cultures and superstitions to simply replace them with alternative foreign myths and dogmas is not an especially virtuous occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s missionary work proceeds by wrapping much needed aid, desperately required in the developing world, in a religious package. This may superficially seem like a pretty good deal. Food, money and education can be distributed by compassionate well meaning individuals where it is most needed along with a message of an all loving God than may also bring hope to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly however, I suspect the God packaging that accompanies this aid is not as benign as we would hope. Seeding the currently dominant western religion spreads the doctrines and creeds based on the myths and superstitious at the root of that religion.  An ancient revealed truth is by definition problematic to update in line with the modern world and therefore frequently at odds with liberal thinking, gender equality, tolerance and the extended morality embraced by a more progressive secular society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To draw an analogy, I recall a conversation many years ago with a religious friend who explained to me why she was boycotting all Nestle products. She explained how their policy of providing free formula milk to new mothers in the third world provided useful and immediate benefit but in the long term created a troublesome dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some religious aid may well be distributed without strings attached, there is nonetheless a certain amount of religious packaging to much of the aid.  The spread of these ideas must surely be the cause in many of the current problems experienced in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give two short examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local Nigerian priest denouncing a 5 year old child as a witch due to his religious delusion rather than a logical understanding of causation and correlation is sadly far from an isolated event. This &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/3407882/Child-witches-of-Nigeria-seek-refuge.html"&gt;report from the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; details how hundreds of children have been branded as witches, and before being pushed out of their homes, have been beaten, slashed with knives, thrown onto fires or had acid poured over them in an attempt to make them confess to being possessed by demons. A harrowing echo of the Inquisition in our own pre-enlightened times and a direct consequence of a warped religious mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, as Ann Widdecombe will be expecting me to mention, the papal misinformation concerning his supposedly infallible claim that condoms actually contribute to the spread of the HIV Aids virus. I could not think of a more fatally dangerous meme to propagate in countries rife with the HIV virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Intelliegence2 debate, Hitchens and Fry held a strong set of trump cards that made it virtually impossible for them to loose the debate in front of a rational thinking audience. But why not ensure that Rationality and Reason hold the full set of the trump cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m somewhat embarrassed by the fact that pious believers can point at comparatively miserly levels of secular aid. Can we not strive to ensure we gradually increase the level of no strings attached, non religious aid offered. I’ve no wish for people to withdraw their support for a religious charity if they don’t replace it with an equivalent secular donation. But hopefully more people will eventually want to donate for humanitarian reasons rather than religious reasons, and I think things are indeed moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally, a hat-tip to Ariane Sherine, who recently edited the delightful, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1257939039&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheists Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book whose proceeds will go to the Terrence Higgins Trust, and hopefully in some way counter the harm caused by Papal Propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative newbies who haven't been reading this blog that long may be wondering why I, a physician, booster of science-based medicine, and scourge of the anti-vaccine movement (well, at least in my mind, anyway) would blog about Holocaust denial, but in actuality my interest in combatting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/holocaust_denial/"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt; predates my interest in combatting quackery by at least two years. Indeed, one of my &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/01/musings-on-60th-anniversary-of.html"&gt;earliest long-form posts for this blog&lt;/a&gt;, written more than a year before I joined ScienceBlogs and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/how_i_discovered_holocaust_denial.php"&gt;reposted after I joined&lt;/a&gt; relates how I discovered Holocaust denial, my confusion and revulsion upon that discovery, and how I became involved in refuting it. Although these days I don't write about it as often as I used to, I've never lost my interest in it and have still on occasion done rather lengthy posts on it. And it can't be said often enough: Holocaust denial derives from either anti-Semitism, Hitler admiration or apologia, or both. Always. After all, as I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/bioethicist_art_caplan_the_darwinhitler.php"&gt;echoed a Usenet regular&lt;/a&gt; named Allan Matthews, who&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.revisionism/msg/18511afaa1574ac9?hl=en&amp;amp;pli=1"&gt;once asked&lt;/a&gt; so brilliantly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;See, you'd think that after many months of posting this at least one revisionist who isn't a neo-Nazi or anti-Semite would have come forward and said "Here I am!"
But, no. It appears that there just aren't any such revisionists around.

&lt;p&gt;Based on their past posting history, the few bozos who have bothered to claim that they aren't neo-Nazis or anti-Semites were, upon examination of their claims, found to be clearly lying. Of course, given the general behavior of revisionists, this lack of honesty isn't surprising in the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just in case some revisionist 'scholars' have missed my question to date, here it is again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the revisionists who aren't neo-Nazis or anti-Semites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fair question. After all, how can revisionists hope to be taken seriously if they all have such apparent biases, agendas and axes to grind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, then, if Holocaust revisionism is an intellectually honest endeavor, where are the revisionists who aren't neo-Nazis or anti-Semites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never found such a Holocaust "revisionist."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/combatting_holocaust_denial_ur_doing_it.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/combatting_holocaust_denial_ur_doing_it.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/bJlxMTRamNg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258034528012"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=4207">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a95a873d9a63a0b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Don’t Forget Shakespeare Denialism!</title><published>2009-11-12T14:01:15Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T14:01:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/12/dont-forget-shakespeare-denialism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-4212" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/12/dont-forget-shakespeare-denialism/shakespeare/"&gt;&lt;img title="shakespeare" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/11/shakespeare-249x300.jpg" alt="shakespeare" width="249" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We’ve been having a lot of fun this week talking about Tom Bethell’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/09/bethell-questions-einstein-not-kidding/"&gt;anti-Einstein views&lt;/a&gt; and how they &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/10/conservative-dustup-over-relativity-denialism/"&gt;may or may not relate&lt;/a&gt; to modern American conservatism. And inevitably, the dialogue has also dredged up a lot of context about all the other areas in which Bethell challenges a firmly accepted scholarly or scientific body of knowledge–including one I hadn’t even recognized yet &lt;strong&gt;[until &lt;a href="http://shakespeareauthorship.com)/"&gt;David Kathman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/11/10/conservative-dustup-over-relativity-denialism/#comment-35646"&gt;put me on to it&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;. But first, let’s review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethell &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/02/post_3.php"&gt;questions the link&lt;/a&gt; between HIV and AIDS. He is also, as &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/upping_the_anti"&gt;I have noted&lt;/a&gt;, a climate change “skeptic” and an evolution denier. And then there is the whole Einstein business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even I didn’t know that he was &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/shakes/beth.htm"&gt;also an “Oxfordian”&lt;/a&gt;–e.g., adherent to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordian_theory"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; that William Shakespeare was really the Earl of Oxford, and not from Stratford-on-Avon (the mainstream “Stratfordian” view). The Oxfordian “theory” is most emphatically not the view held by the vast bulk of Shakepeare scholars…but hey, if you’re willing to throw out Einstein and Darwin in favor of some dubious contrarian view, why not go for the trifecta!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father happens to be an English professor who specializes in Shakespeare–and, of course, is a Stratfordian–so the analogies with other kinds of denial and conspiracy theorizing are especially striking to me. I will grant, of course, that the anti-Stratfordian position on Shakespeare’s identity does not–unlike climate change denial–pose a great threat to the human future. But it remains, nevertheless, a classic case of throwing out historical evidence and scholarly expertise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258034440735"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=10473">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0db6e1ea9199017</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 11.12</title><published>2009-11-12T13:45:48Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T13:45:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/11/skepchick-quickies-11-12/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Politicians are also in control of the public’s purse strings, and so funding science also cannot be free from politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ideally we should have an atmosphere in which politicians and funding agencies set broad agendas, and then let scientists decide the details of which research should be funded based upon the science. It is, in fact, an important trust that public money that is spent on scientific research be utilized optimally, and not to promote someone’s narrow ideological agenda. Examples of abuses are legion; my favorite example is the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), Senator Tom Harkin’s pet project in which the usual standards of medical research have been subverted to promote sectarian medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want scientists to follow their noses – to research those questions they think are most fruitful. But scientists are often forced to follow the funding, and this distorts the direction of research. Industry funding distorts research in ways that are advantageous to industry – a real problem that is being examined and there are at least attempts to deal with it. Government funding should be neutral, and provide a counterbalance to industry funding, but is often subverted to ideology. Even well-meaning patient-groups can distort funding if they try to dictate what scientists should be researching in exchange for their fund-raising, with detrimental effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the area of autism research has also become overly politicized, where ideological agendas threaten to distort the allocation of funding, and therefore the direction of research. The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) is tasked with reviewing the strategic plan for government funded autism research on an annual basis. This is part of the Combating Autism Act passed by Congress. Recently the IACC has been meeting to determine the strategic plan for the next year, and decided to include &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/iacc-includes-vaccine-research-objective-strategic-plan-autism-research-27151.html"&gt;research into possible links between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new language, approved unanimously, calls for studies to determine if there are sub-populations that are more susceptible to environmental exposures such as immune challenges related to naturally occurring infections, vaccines or underlying immune problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision represents, in my opinion, the infiltration into the autism community of anti-vaccinationists – who have an agenda other than researching autism. In fact, the anti-vaccine movement has been unfortunately successful in branding themselves as autism activists and experts. This decision by the IACC represents the fruits of that infiltration – a distortion of funding for autism research to suit their anti-vaccine agenda. In fact, two &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/about/member-roster.shtml"&gt;members of the IACC&lt;/a&gt; – Lyn Redwood and Lee Grossman, were added specifically to represent the anti-vaccine movement in the (probably misguided) hope of placating that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that there are not those who are sincerely concerned about autism research and curing autism, and who honestly think that researching a potential link to vaccines or some other environment trigger is a legitimate avenue of research. Rather, I am saying that this view largely stems from and anti-vaccine ideology and is not supported by existing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also stems from a distrust of the scientific and medical community, which creates a fatal conflict that renders this research agenda practically useless. Of course, if a previously undetected link to vaccines or an environment trigger is discovered by this research, I have no doubt the scientific community will respond in a way that is proportional to the evidence. However, given existing research, it seems unlikely that a significant link will be discovered (although it is probable that minor environmental triggers are out there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if rigorous research continues to show no link between vaccine and autism, the very people who are pushing for this research are unlikely to be moved, if history is to be any guide. The anti-vaccine movement has a well-documented history of moving the goalpost (it’s MMR, no it’s thimerosal, no it’s other toxins – wait, we have to test every vaccine and every ingredient for every possible side effect). They also dismiss research showing no link as flawed or compromised, regardless of the reality. Even when they are involved in the research up front – all they care about are results, not methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the NCCAM, it is pointless to do scientific research to please those with an anti-scientific agenda. When the NCCAM failed to validate any CAM methods, Tom Harkin whined that they were not fulfilling their mandate – as if their mandate were not to conduct rigorous science, but to validate his ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the anti-vaccine movement has made themselves the squeaky wheel in autism research, and politicians have bowed to their pressure. There is always insufficient pressure from those who simply want unsullied science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In enacting the Combating Autism Act (CAA), Congress intended that the federal government examine potential links between vaccines and autism. During the Senate debate over the CAA, Mike Enzi, Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor &amp;amp; Pensions Committee, instructed that “no research avenue should be eliminated, including biomedical research examining potential links between vaccines, vaccine components, and autism spectrum disorder.” 152 Cong. Rec. S8772&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is clear pandering. It also contains a significant misconception – the idea of eliminating research avenues. This is the wrong way to look at research. There is always limited funding and resources to research potentially limitless questions and avenues. The question, therefore, is not which avenues to eliminate, but which avenues to pursue. Deciding to pursue genetic causes of autism, because that’s where the evidence is leading, is not the same thing as “eliminating” other avenues. Each research question, in order to garner funding, should justify itself based upon evidence, plausibility, and potential for benefit. That is the standard that is generally applied – unless political pressure is brought to bear to distort the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should a Senator busy himself with making statements about the details of research? That is an inappropriate level of meddling. It derives from convincing politicians that the scientific process is already distorted, which itself stems from distrust of the scientific and medical communities. Which brings us back to the inherent problem of letting those who distrust the scientific process set the agenda for scientific research. No good can come of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, however, always a little conflicted on these issue (such as researching autism and vaccines and the NCCAM). I like having more research to inform raging public debates. If this research provides more evidence against a link between vaccines and autism, I will be happy to have it. If it shows, with rigorous science, that there is some connection we have missed, I will be happy to update my opinion on the matter, and glad that new interventions may be possible. But the same can be said about any research – even research into highly dubious questions. If ESP research shows that ESP is a real phenomenon, I will be happy to accept it. But at the same time, I think ESP is highly unlikely to the point that it does not deserve limited public funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we have to also consider – what discoveries will not be made because limited autism funding is being shunted away from more promising research in order to placate the anti-vaccinationists (especially considering that they can never be placated)? We will likely never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IACC strategic plan is a squeaky-wheel, politically motivated agenda, not the optimal allocation of limited public research funds based upon an objective assessment of the state of the science. It is the result of constant bullying from the anti-vaccine movement.

The motion: &lt;em&gt;"The Catholic Church is a force for good in the world"&lt;/em&gt; was supported by Anne Widdecombe MP and Archbishop John Onaiyekan and most eloquently and deftly opposed by Archatheist Christopher Hitches and National Treasure, Stephen Fry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have seen the video or read the reports you will already know that it was a complete rout for the Enlightenment with Widdecombe and Onaiyekan receiving a damn good verbal kicking. A boxing referee may well have shown pity and called a halt to the proceedings after round 2, but Zeinab Badawi allowed the punch drunk Catholics to cling on to the ropes for the duration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was of course, delighted to hear Hitchens and Fry drawing attention to the  long list of unequivocal harm proliferated and condoned by the Catholic Church, both in its long history and indeed now. And I was of course unsurprised that the Catholic apologists where unable to justify the inhumane actions of their Church and disappointed that they were also unwilling to apologise for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a resounding victory for free thought in the final vote of the evening, I wanted to ensure that the one positive point offered by Widdecombe and Onaiyekan was not simply ignored in the heat of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument put forward from the Catholic camp to support the motion was the undeniable massive amount of much needed aid and charity supplied by the Church. However, before looking at this, allow me to backtrack a few hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the church had a complete strangle hold on society, it was free to bolster its numbers in foreign parts and spread the good word with a good old fashioned Crusade. Thankfully, in these enlightened times the majority of us can see the immorality in such an approach. If however the term Crusade still holds a little romance for you, try substituting it for Jihad, as its true meaning is much clearer when not blurred by you own particular belief system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually replacing crusades with missionary work seemed to provide a more acceptable non-violent evangelism for spreading the gospel to those not fortunate enough to have been born into the one true faith. Although once again with modern eyes we can see how breaking Star Trek’s prime directive is not especially wise, and interfering with local cultures and superstitions to simply replace them with alternative foreign myths and dogmas is not an especially virtuous occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s missionary work proceeds by wrapping much needed aid, desperately required in the developing world, in a religious package. This may superficially seem like a pretty good deal. Food, money and education can be distributed by compassionate well meaning individuals where it is most needed along with a message of an all loving God than may also bring hope to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly however, I suspect the God packaging that accompanies this aid is not as benign as we would hope. Seeding the currently dominant western religion spreads the doctrines and creeds based on the myths and superstitious at the root of that religion.  An ancient revealed truth is by definition problematic to update in line with the modern world and therefore frequently at odds with liberal thinking, gender equality, tolerance and the extended morality embraced by a more progressive secular society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To draw an analogy, I recall a conversation many years ago with a religious friend who explained to me why she was boycotting all Nestle products. She explained how their policy of providing free formula milk to new mothers in the third world provided useful and immediate benefit but in the long term created a troublesome dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some religious aid may well be distributed without strings attached, there is nonetheless a certain amount of religious packaging to much of the aid.  The spread of these ideas must surely be the cause in many of the current problems experienced in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give two short examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local Nigerian priest denouncing a 5 year old child as a witch due to his religious delusion rather than a logical understanding of causation and correlation is sadly far from an isolated event. This &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/3407882/Child-witches-of-Nigeria-seek-refuge.html"&gt;report from the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; details how hundreds of children have been branded as witches, and before being pushed out of their homes, have been beaten, slashed with knives, thrown onto fires or had acid poured over them in an attempt to make them confess to being possessed by demons. A harrowing echo of the Inquisition in our own pre-enlightened times and a direct consequence of a warped religious mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, as Ann Widdecombe will be expecting me to mention, the papal misinformation concerning his supposedly infallible claim that condoms actually contribute to the spread of the HIV Aids virus. I could not think of a more fatally dangerous meme to propagate in countries rife with the HIV virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Intelliegence2 debate, Hitchens and Fry held a strong set of trump cards that made it virtually impossible for them to loose the debate in front of a rational thinking audience. But why not ensure that Rationality and Reason hold the full set of the trump cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m somewhat embarrassed by the fact that pious believers can point at comparatively miserly levels of secular aid. Can we not strive to ensure we gradually increase the level of no strings attached, non religious aid offered. I’ve no wish for people to withdraw their support for a religious charity if they don’t replace it with an equivalent secular donation. But hopefully more people will eventually want to donate for humanitarian reasons rather than religious reasons, and I think things are indeed moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally, a hat-tip to Ariane Sherine, who recently edited the delightful, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atheists-Guide-Christmas-Ariane-Sherine/dp/0007322615/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1257939039&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheists Guide to Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book whose proceeds will go to the Terrence Higgins Trust, and hopefully in some way counter the harm caused by Papal Propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;

Khaya Dlanga described it at length in a weblog post a week ago ("&lt;a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/khayadlanga/2009/11/05/yesterday-a-short-lived-war-broke-out-between-america-and-south-africa/"&gt;Yesterday, a short-lived war broke out between the US and SA&lt;/a&gt;"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A virtual war between the United States and South Africa was full-on yesterday, the weapon of choice being Twitter. Unfortunately, the weapon was an American one too. Of course in the bigger scheme of things, even in the smaller scheme, this was an insignificant spat. The war was fought at 140 characters at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It was between South African blacks and African Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; […] The tweet that caused all the trouble is a certain trending topic that went as follows — before I say, I should explain what a trending topic is. Twitter tracks the 10 most popular topics of the day and ranks them according to popularity. These topics are usually preceded by a hash tag. Allow me to demonstrate. #khayasthoughtleaderblogsucks. That would be a trending topic, notehowtherearenospacesbetweenthewords. Yes. WedothatonTwitter. The native that caused all the trouble started a trending topic that reached number 1. #thingsdarkiessay. That was the topic. One would say for example, “#thingsdarkiessay I have high-high”. Elderly black folks say they have high-high, by this they mean high blood pressure. Perhaps using more words than necessary increases their blood pressure. Maybe they were the original tweeters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Someone else would then say, “#thingsdarkiessay Stop nonsense”. You get the picture. Completely harmless. Unless you were African American. An avalanche of misunderstanding descended on the South Africans like a ton of 140 character insults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the complaints, the Twitter management removed #thingsdarkiessay as a "trending topic".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In explaining the intercultural misunderstanding, Dlanga offers this exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Dream Hampton, (@dreamhampton) who became the first woman editor of The Source Magazine asked me if “darkie” wasn’t “more akin to the N word?” I explained to her “No, here that would be the K word”. She was fine with the explanation, if not completely comfortable with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this is one of those cases, like &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003020.html"&gt;the Tiger Woods "spaz" debate&lt;/a&gt;, where a word that's innocuous in one variety of English is seen as deeply offensive in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dlanga feels unfairly treated by Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It would seem to me, according to Twitter, tweets Americans find offensive but are innocent to others will not be allowed to be trending topics it seems. Part of social media is that we get to learn about each other. It’s not always going to be just fun, sometimes we have to get a little uncomfortable with one another before we can be truly understanding of each other. Even in our hyper-emotional responses we may pause for a moment, breathe, think and learn something about someone else. They were not wrong in their outrage, nor were we when we joked about things darkies say. What was wrong was the inability to try to understand or explain why we held the views we did. Most of the responses were emotional, not rational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this feeling leads him to a little anti-American joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;At some point I even tried to get the US Embassy (@USEmbPretioria) to intervene, they responded by saying, “@Khayadlanga has more pull power with Twitter than we ever will”. The comment was followed by a smiley face. This response was enough for my over-inflated ego. It’s true, flattery will get you anywhere. All I need is flattery and oxygen. I am more powerful than the United States. I feel like invading something. Anything. Suggestions anyone? Should we vote on it? I say let’s invade Khanyi Mbau or Julius. Kidding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's an obvious problem, from Twitter's point of view.  If a term X is harmless in region A but problematic in B, then not only will right-thinking people in B be offended, but not-so-nice people in B may enthusiastically join in.  Whether (and to what extent) Twitter ought to police such things is another question, of course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258028270803"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IonianEnchantment/~3/ZFE-Ginp3UA/adaptations-for-visual-assessment-of_12.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d0a47f145e78415</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Adaptations for the visual assessment of formadibility: Part II</title><published>2009-11-12T05:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T05:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/VDz7Xhd5R50/adaptations-for-visual-assessment-of_12.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IonianEnchantment/~3/ZFE-Ginp3UA/adaptations-for-visual-assessment-of_12.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In Part I of this series, I summarized the experiments and findings of Aaron Sell and colleagues&amp;#39; paper &amp;quot;Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face&amp;quot;. In Part II, I evaluate their claims.

This evidence Sell et. al. present seems compelling with regards to proposition (i): adults appear to be able to make remarkably accurate estimates of upper-body strength from even degraded cues such as static images of faces. As I noted in Part I, however, the truth of propositions (ii) (that this ability is an adaptation) and (iii) (that upper-body strength determines formidability) are more doubtful. I will assess the evidence for each of these claims, starting with the latter. 

Concluding that the truth of (i) implies people can visually estimate fighting ability – the likelihood of an individual prevailing in combat – requires us to assume (iii): that upper-body strength is a good proxy for formidability. Unfortunately, Sell and his colleagues provide only indirect, theoretical, reasons for supposing this is true: namely, the greater sexual dimorphism between upper-body and lower-body strength and the fact that the driving force of certain weapons is largely a function of upper-body strength (p. 576). ,  These considerations, however, seem far from decisive and while it is certainly plausible that upper-body strength is a very (or the most) important component of fighting ability, rigour clearly requires direct empirical evidence.  Other likely components of formidability – speed, stealth, skill, bravery, etc. – are either orthogonal to, or even negatively correlated with, high upper-body strength. There are doubtlessly multiple complex tradeoffs between the different components of fighting ability and thus there are likely multiple local-optima in ‘formidability space’. The point of this argument is that without an empirical determination of the magnitude of the correlation between formidability and strength, Sell et. al.’s conclusion rests on an (admittedly plausible) assumption. More importantly, however, it is at least possible that uncontrolled-for components of formidability may introduce confounds or complications that could influence the correlation between perceived and actual strength in either direction. For example, there may be a semi-independent ability to estimate fighting skill, and, depending on the direction of the correlation between upper-body strength and this skill, it may lead us to under- or overestimate the accuracy of visual assessment of fighting ability. The problems around claim (iii), however, are comparatively minor; the major weakness of Sell et. al.’s paper lies with their claim that the ability to visually estimate formidability evolved by natural selection.  

An adaptationist claim like (ii) is significantly more complex than other types of propositions because it entails assertions about the past and about design (Symons, 1992: 140-141). As Richard Burian has explained, when one asserts some trait is an adaptation, “one is claiming not only that the feature was brought about by differential reproduction among alternative forms, but also that the relative advantage of this feature vis-à-vis its alternatives played a significant causal role in its production” (1983: 294). In other words, the assertion that the ability to estimate formidability is an adaptation entails that it evolved over deep time by natural selection, and that the ‘function’ of this psychological trait and its neurological substrate is to detect formidability. To say some feature is an adaptation, then, is a compound claim involving multiple independent propositions, each of which requires substantiation.  Sell et. al., it seems to me, fall short of this evidentiary standard, not least because they never  mount an explicit defense of (ii), despite the fact that they have the onus and that it is a crucial aspect of their paper. There are, nonetheless, a number of arguments that can be extracted from the paper (or advanced on behalf of the authors). In rough order from least to most persuasive, these are (a) that (i) was previously unknown and that Sell et. al. predicted its existence from evolutionary considerations, (b) that comparative data indicates that such assessments are widespread and perhaps even homologous across taxa, (c) that accurate visual formidability assessment is at a minimum not highly culturally bound, and perhaps universal, and (d) the functional goodness-of-fit between the ‘design problem’ and its ‘solution’. 

It seems highly significant, firstly, that Sell and his colleagues predicted the existence of a previously unknown trait – i.e. (i) – from general comparative and evolutionarily psychological considerations. It is important to be careful here, though, because it is entirely possible for (i) to be true but for (ii) to be false (but obviously not vice versa). Some philosophy of science should clarify the situation. Hans Reichenbach (1938) usefully distinguished between the “context of discovery” (the creative process of using background knowledge to invent new hypotheses and theories) and the “context of justification” (the evidence-driven process of testing hypotheses and subjecting them to peer evaluation). For example, Friedrich Kekulé von Stradonitz reportedly first imagined the six-carbon ring structure of benzene after having a dream of an ouroboros (the context of discovery). It does not follow from this, however, that benzene actually had anything to do with snakes, or that testing the idea (the context of justification) involved an ancient symbol. Similarly, even if Sell et. al. predicted the existence of an ability to make formidability estimates from evolutionary theory, it does not necessarily follow that the trait evolved. Propositions (i) and (ii) are logically and epistemically independent, and each needs to be tested against related but different sets of evidence. The fact that (i) was predicted rather than retrodicted from evolution gives as no more than prima facie reason to think it evolved and (a) is thus weak evidence for (ii). 

Sell et. al. cite a large and growing body of literature that documents parallels between human and non-human conflict, including, importantly, evidence that non-human animals can visually detect formidability. If this trait is homologous across species, including humans – and that is a gargantuan if – we can be confident (ii) is true since homology suggests that the emergence and persistence of the trait is due to natural selection. It should be clear, however, that building a convincing phylogenetic case for such a widespread homology would be a mammoth undertaking, and no one, as far as I know, has yet done so. The fact that there seems to be a preliminary case for homology is at best suggestive, no conclusions can reasonably be drawn until much more science is done. In other words, were (b) true we could reasonably infer (ii), but we simply do not have enough evidence to conclude (b) is in fact true so, on current evidence, it provides minimal support. 

The logic of argument (c) is the following: given that traits that reliably emerge in developmentally normal individuals are likely (though not necessarily) adaptations, de...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is &lt;strong&gt;Will Phillips&lt;/strong&gt; and he’s 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason I like him is because he doesn’t stand up during the Pledge of Allegiance.  It has nothing to do with the “Under God” phrase, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the &lt;a href="http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=48ff732a-137e-4a3d-a511-9e43ec430096"&gt;wonderful way he articulates why he doesn’t want to do it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Will’s family has a number of gay friends. In recent years, [mother] Laura Phillips said, they’ve been trying to be a straight ally to the gay community, going to the pride parades and standing up for the rights of their gay and lesbian neighbors. They’ve been especially dismayed by the effort to take away the rights of homosexuals — the right to marry, and the right to adopt. Given that, Will immediately saw a problem with the pledge of allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’ve always tried to analyze things because I want to be lawyer,” Will said. “I really don’t feel that there’s currently liberty and justice for all.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of our interview, I ask young Will a question that might be a civics test nightmare for your average 10-year-old. Will’s answer, though, is good enough — simple enough, true enough — to give me a little rush of goose pimples.  &lt;strong&gt;What does being an American mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Freedom of speech,” Will says, without even stopping to think. “The freedom to disagree. That’s what I think pretty much being an American represents.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.  Most adults can’t articulate a decent answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the clincher and the reason Will deserves your respect.  Because of his family’s support of the GLBT community, you can guess what the other kids say about him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In the lunchroom and in the hallway, they’ve been making comments and doing pranks, and calling me gay,” [Will] said. “It’s always the same people, walking up and calling me a gaywad.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will is still holding true to his beliefs, though, because he know what he stands for.  Those kids don’t understand so they say whatever they can to make him feel bad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t back down, Will!  A lot of us are looking up to you.)  He has a level of maturity that most high schoolers never attain, much less a 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grader.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How incredible is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hats off to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arktimes.com/Authors/AuthorViewer.aspx?AuthorID=b4a3aa21-ba2d-408c-af25-46c374eeaad0"&gt;David Koon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Arkansas Times&lt;/em&gt; for bringing this story to a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was written in 1942 by Grantly Dick-Read, widely considered to be the father of modern natural childbirth. Most people don’t realize that natural childbirth was invented by a man to convince middle and upper class women that childbirth pain is in their minds, thereby encouraging them to have more children. Read’s central claim was that “primitive” women do not have pain in childbirth. In contrast, women of the upper classes were “overcivilized” and had been socialized to believe that childbirth is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/79/929/168"&gt;Holistic obstetrics: the origins of “natural childbirth” in Britain&lt;/a&gt;, O Moscucci, PMJ 2003;79:168-173, Dr. Ornella Moscucci explains the backdrop against which the philosophy of  “natural” childbirth was promulgated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health policy became the subject of intense public debate in the aftermath of the Boer war, when Britain’s near defeat at the hands of a barely trained army focused the attention on the physical fitness of new recruits… Adherents to the new science of eugenics on the other hand blamed heredity. In their view, health policy should aim to prevent reproduction among “low quality” human stock .., and encourage reproduction among “good” stock…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of “natural childbirth” owed much to the activities of physicians and health professionals who were in sympathy with the aims of reform eugenics…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]hese health reformers were concerned about the differential birth rate—the tendency of poorer, less healthy sections of society to have larger families than their “betters”. Thus, as well as endorsing plans for the sterilisation and detention of “degenerates”, they also sought to encourage the middle classes to have more children… Female education and employment were seen as a particular evil, insofar as they led women to regard motherhood a burden and to neglect hearth and home…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious way to reverse the falling birth was to entice women of “superior stock” back into the home, where they would fulfill their functions as wives and mothers. Health reformers took up the challenge by developing an ideology of childbirth that emphasised the “naturalness” of pregnancy and birth. This ideology functioned at a number of levels. It was prescriptive, in that it rooted woman’s social role in her biological capacity for reproduction… Motherhood was not only a woman’s supreme fulfilment and reward, but also her civic duty…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read himself stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Woman fails when she ceases to desire the children for which she was primarily made. Her true emancipation lies in freedom to fulfil her biological purposes”..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparisons between “overcivilized” white women and “primitive” women who gave birth easily was not merely the product of racism, but reflected the anxiety that men felt about women’s emancipation. This anxiety was expressed in medicine generally, and in obstetrics and gynecology particularly, by the fabrication of claims about the “disease” of hysteria and the degeneration of women’s natural capabilities in fertility and childbirth compared to her “savage” peers. Simply put, the result of women insisting on increased education, enlarged roles outside the home and greater political participation was that their ovaries shriveled, they suddenly began to experience painful childbirth and they developed the brand new disease of “hysteria”, located in the uterus itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain in childbirth served a very important function in this racist and sexist discourse: it was the punishment that befell women who became too educated, too independent and left the home. The idea that “primitive” women had painless childbirth was fabricated to contrast with the painful childbirth of “overcivilized” women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscucci writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether women experienced pain or not depended on cultural attitudes to childbirth rather than on some property inherent to parturition. Dick-Read … claimed that primitives experienced easy, painless labours. This was because in primitive societies the survival value of childbirth was fully appreciated and labour was regarded as nothing more than “hard work” in the struggle for existence. In civilised societies on the other hand a number of cultural factors conspired to distort woman’s natural capacity for painless birth, producing in woman a fear of childbirth that hindered normal parturition…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate pain, the fear-tension-pain cycle must be broken … Women had to be “tactfully, gradually and carefully initiated into the job they were about to perform”. Education in the “facts” of natural childbirth and instruction in the methods of relaxation were the chief weapons in the battle against fear… According to Dick-Read, these psychological techniques would not only eliminate pain, but also shorten labour and reduce the need for surgical interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grantly Dick-Read was issuing a warning to women of a certain social class: if you step beyond the roles prescribed for women, you will be punished with painful labor. And if you have had painful labor, you should understand it as a punishment for ignoring your “natural” duty to stay home and procreate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the contemporary popularity of natural childbirth is more than a bit ironic. The central claims of natural childbirth, that childbirth is not inherently painful, and that if you “prepare” properly, your birth will be painless, too, were utter fabrications. Read would be delighted that these fabrications have been embraced by many women and that his philosophy has been propagated so successfully that most women don’t even realize that the central tenets of natural childbirth are racist and sexist fabrications.&lt;/p&gt;

I give it here (name shortened so as not to embarrass a nice person simply doing her job):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br&gt;
My name is S.F. and I am working on a project for the History Channel.  We are searching for 2 lead investigators to host a tv series documentary on the topic of 2012 and other unexplained phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw your site and work and would love to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.seekers2012.com – please see all information here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As your website and life have brought me here I think that you might be interested in looking further at what we are looking for and perhaps help us find our people or if it is you, we hope that you will sign up! &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also really appreciate it if you could possibly post to your blog as well or send to your network.  Any help in our quest would be great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know how I can help you.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on twitter here: http://www.twitter.com/seekers2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells were clanging the Red Alert in my head from the opening sentence, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and clicked on the link. In short, they are casting for a History Channel series and are hoping for the Internet to do their work for them. Here is an excerpt from the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentary series for the History Channel, surrounding the Mayan prediction that 2012 will be the END OF DAYS as well as other unexplained phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male &amp;amp; Female Investigators who are scientists, explorers, or adventurers with advanced degrees (Ph.D desired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal Investigators would already be a team (husband and wife, co- workers) who fall somewhere between the FBI Agents on “The X Files” and “Indiana Jones”. One is a believer, the other a skeptic. One is driven by reason, science and empirical evidence, the other by feelings, intuitions and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the woman would be the skeptic and the man the believer. We are not limiting ourselves to an existing team nor will we rule out a woman who is the believer and a man who is the skeptic. We are open to any combination as long as they are articulate, passionate, and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators must also be genuinely curious as to why there are predictions in nearly every culture that the world will end in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, they will have no trouble getting people to fall all over themselves competing for these roles. But if, as they say, they are genuinely interested in getting Ph.Ds (at least Ph.Ds in any relevant science) will who concur with their premise, good luck to them. Bailing Balloon Kid’s dad out of prison is probably as close to a “scientist” as they will get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here was my reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your website says “there are predictions in nearly every culture that the world will end in 2012.” In fact, outside of New Age beliefs that have arisen in the past few years, there are NO known predictions of that in ANY culture, or any credible reasons to believe 2012 is any different from any other year. Science journalists like myself work hard to get people interested in the wonders of our natural universe, and the malignant spread of made-up nonsense like this makes that task so much harder. Consequently, I consider your project harmful to the intellect, and I choose not to promote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how other recipients answered, but I hope it was with something similar, if at all. As I said, shows like this are not in the public interest. They are lazy. They substitute sensationalism for good writing. It’s hard to write an exciting piece of entertainment, but it’s easier if you simply leech off of a popular superstition. Paying lip service to science by offering to have “a skeptic AND a believer” does not change the obvious fact that this show is based on an untrue premise and leverages fear to promote a preselected conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows better than I how hard it is to write good entertainment when you burden yourself with the requirement that the information you present, in addition to being great entertainment, also be helpful to the audience. That’s why we’ve spent two years (so far) developing &lt;a href="http://www.skeptologists.com/"&gt;The Skeptologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience does not have much expertise in science beyond what we, as the content providers, give them. So, at the end of the day, the blame for the plummeting quality of science broadcasting has to land squarely in the lap of the producers of shows like this one. Audiences are not demanding true information or false information: They demand good entertainment. The value of the information we choose to deliver with that entertainment is the measure of our character.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258017602447"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4631">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3cb32883929a16fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Skepticism"/><category term="Global Warming"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="UFOs/aliens"/><category term="religion"/><category term="aliens"/><category term="autism"/><category term="carbon dioxide"/><category term="Catholicism"/><category term="CNN"/><category term="Gay marriage"/><category term="Glenn Beck"/><category term="homosexuality"/><category term="Lou Dobbs"/><category term="Mormons"/><category term="Vatican"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 11.11.09</title><published>2009-11-12T09:04:47Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T09:04:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-11-11-09-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:xYStx9ndY03T0M:http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NUZ_fM-TQKQ/SBZwF0fKdTI/AAAAAAAAFpY/7_1pZ2yn7wM/s400/loudobbs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:xYStx9ndY03T0M:http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NUZ_fM-TQKQ/SBZwF0fKdTI/AAAAAAAAFpY/7_1pZ2yn7wM/s400/loudobbs.jpg" alt="" width="153" height="106"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ap_en_ot/us_tv_lou_dobbs"&gt;Lou Dobbs leaves CNN&lt;/a&gt; – Good riddance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, University of Missouri researchers have developed a pupil response test that is 92.5 percent accurate in separating children with autism from those with typical development. In the study, MU scientists found that children with autism have slower pupil responses to light change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data show that the balance between the airborne and the absorbed fraction of carbon dioxide has stayed approximately constant since 1850, despite emissions of carbon dioxide having risen from about 2 billion tons a year in 1850 to 35 billion tons a year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that terrestrial ecosystems and the oceans have a much greater capacity to absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than had been previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She admits that, on the surface, EBF3 reminds many people of a Star Trek replicator in which, for example, Captain Picard announces out loud, “Tea, Earl Grey, hot.” Then there is a brief hum, a flash of light and the stimulating drink appears from a nook in the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, EBF3 works in a vacuum chamber, where an electron beam is focused on a constantly feeding source of metal, which is melted and then applied as called for by a drawing — one layer at a time — on top of a rotating surface until the part is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Beck couldn’t silence the questions and the so mirror sites using this Fark-inspired meme applying Beck’s own “I’m just asking the question” tactic remain on the web. What are you trying to hide, Glenn? And why haven’t you denied that you raped and murdered a young girl in 1990? Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiddos to South Park for nailing this particular Beck tactic on tonight’s show.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe they’ll finally pardon Giordano    Bruno, an Italian monk, who was put to death by the Inquisition in 1600 for suggesting life might exist somewhere else in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

He threatens to sue me as a trespasser. The Farmer can prove he owns the field and he can also prove that I am standing in his field.  He doesn't have to prove damage, for - like libel - trespass is actionable without proof of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aha&lt;/em&gt;," I say, "&lt;em&gt;I have a legally-valid contractual licence (like a ticket for a rave); I have a legal right to be on this land; and so I have a complete defence to your action for trespass&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No you haven't&lt;/em&gt;," replies the Farmer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In court, it would then be for me to prove that I have a licence, and not for the Farmer to disprove it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It would be the same with the owner of a copyright suing someone claiming to have lawfully downloaded a copyrighted work, though there damage would have to be shown.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not think this is necessarily unreasonable: I claim to have a licence and so it is for me to show that is the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this is, like in libel, a reverse burden: I am having to prove my defence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what has gone wrong in libel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine now a Reputable Person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I defame that person - almost literally I de-fame her. By analogy, I am trespassing on her reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In theory, the Reputable Person has to prove that she has a reputation in England &amp;amp; Wales and that I have defamed that reputation. In this way, the Reputable Person is in a position similar to the Farmer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the Reputable Person has shown this, then the law says it is for me to prove that I am lawfully defaming that reputation, just like an alleged trespasser can try and show he has a legal right to be in the field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where, in my view, libel has partly broken down on this issue is that the courts just nod through what the Reputable Person needs to show to get the claim off the ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any link with England &amp;amp; Wales seems to be enough; no scrutiny is put to whether someone actually has a relevant reputation; and any criticism (even calling Steven Berkoff ugly) is held to be defamatory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the burden is instantly thrown on to the other side - to show that the statement was justified or fair comment or privileged. And with this burden goes all the terrifying costs risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, libel should not be treated like trespass or copyright infringement; the claimant should have to certify the falsity of the defamatory factual statement before a claim can be brought, and that this certification should be open to cross-examination by the defendant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But courts should be far more rigororus in putting the claimant to test on what already has to be proved to bring a libel case: that there is an applicable reputation in England &amp;amp; Wales in the first place, and that the statement defames that reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the courts did this then the reverse burden of proof (and the costs) would not be such a problem.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-7610967210994316903?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258013992740"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4628">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/069bcf2611104251</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="David Gorski"/><category term="Desiree Jennings"/><category term="Generation Rescue"/><category term="J.B.

&lt;p&gt;Well, Handley’s back with a new tirade against David Gorski that makes me think he’s out to become the new Glenn Beck, titled, “&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/dr-david-gorski-jumps-the-shark-over-desiree-jennings-case.html"&gt;Dr. David Gorski Jumps the Shark over Desiree Jennings Case&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as a quick aside, being a media guy, even the title pisses me off because despite Handley’s acknowledgement of the origin of the term “jumping the shark,” he still uses it divorced from any television context. People don’t even use the term for filmmakers. Jumping the shark is a term that specifically describes an episode of a television show that definitively marks the beginning of that shows downfall. Often audiences jump the gun and declare an episode has jumped the shark (pardon the mixed metaphor) too early. For example, many people were claiming that &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; jumped the shark early in season two. But applying the term to real life just makes you look juvenile (or more so in Handley’s case). But his usage of the term also annoys me because obviously Handley has despised Gorski and his position for years, so declaring a blog that’s nothing unusual for Gorski his “jumping the shark” moment is laughable. Handley’s clearly thought every critic of his has jumped the shark years ago, so it seems as though he’s just being over-dramatic to draw in more readers because nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, moving on. Handley then fails to get through a paragraph before harping on his personal favorite trivial fact that in addition to blogging under his own name, Gorski also blogs under a pen name, something that’s no secret to anyone who does even the slightest bit of research considering Gorski often reposts the same blog in different locations under his real name on one site and under his pen name on another. But despite this being no secret, Handley seems to never tire of trying to “out” him by revealing both identities as if he thinks this proves what a great detective he is or something or thinks that knowing this non-secret gives him some power over Gorski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for many paragraphs, Handley just flings his feces at Gorski, for instance, by calling him “the bitchy diva of Scienceblogs” (PZ Myers? PalMD? Jason Rosenhouse? Abbie Smith?). Could you be more specific, Handley? And bitchy diva? Are you sure you weren’t just looking in the mirror?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley next uses his second favorite tactic, scare quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with this odious “doctor”, note that he is exceptionally proud of himself for his blogging status:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Handley. Gorski actually is a doctor, you’re the one who just plays one on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is followed by a long string of short, random, cut-up quotes mined from Gorski’s many blogs compiled together to create the illusion that Gorski is full of himself and his own biggest fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with this odious “doctor”, note that he is exceptionally proud of himself for his blogging status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as I’ve yet been able to ascertain, I’m the only academic surgeon with R01 funding in the world with an active — and, even more shockingly, even a somewhat popular — blog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s also very proud that he got into medical school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I got into the University of Michigan Medical School, which got around 3,000 applications every year for around 180 positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that he studied like a real demon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So insane was I that one year I took 17 credits in the fall semester, all but 3 of which were hard-core science classes, including graduate level biochemistry, and then did the same thing again the next semester.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, his hobbies are quite expansive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My recreation of choice most evenings these days is to blog. It truly is my hobby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough on his fascinating background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone who bothers to read Gorski’s blogs who doesn’t have an axe to grind will find that Handley’s quote-mining doesn’t bare any resemblance at all Gorski’s writings. And while I’m used to Handley’s other tactics, this one in particular somehow strikes me as the most despicable and dishonest. This isn’t even good by quote-mining standards. Anyone could do what Handley does to create whatever image they please of those they’re attacking. It requires no skill at all. I could collect a huge library of sentences from Handley’s many writings and cut them up to make Handley appear however I please. But I won’t because I’m not a dishonest douchebag like Handley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is followed by, surprise-surprise, it’s more feces-flinging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain amazed by Dr. Gorski’s angry, disrespectful, biting, caustic, and immature approach that he uses in criticizing other physicians who he doesn’t agree with. You want to take a guy like me to task, no problem. But, physician to physician? It strikes me as being wildly unprofessional, particularly in an area like medicine, where so much remains that we truly do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry? Disrespectiful? Biting? Caustic? Immature? Pot. Kettle. Black. J.B., if you really can’t see that all of these adjectives describe the very blog in which you use them to describe Gorski, then you truly have an amazing capacity for self-deception. And which physicians are you claiming Gorski is attacking? Cause every expert in a field relevant to the Desiree Jennings case agrees with him. And really, J.B., it’s sad that Gorski should have to address the claims of someone like you. Really,  actual physicians shouldn’t have to refute the proposterous claims of scientifically illiterate clowns like yourself. In a fair fight, you’d be debating an intellectual equal like Carrie Prejean or Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gorski, I know why other scientists and doctors don’t blog: they are interested in maintaining a decorum and professionalism in their chosen profession that you have long since abandoned. How does his blogging style translate to Dr. Gorski’s bedside manner with patients? Let’s just hope he has multiple personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley, allow me to introduce you to the internet, a place where hundreds of physicians can be found blogging about all matters of topics that interest them. But if blogging is so beneath you then maybe you should give it up yourself. Maybe you should be asking how does J.B.’s blogging style translate to his personality in the real world? Let’s just hope he has multiple personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then FINALLY, Handley begins to address the actual Jennings case a good several hundred words into his short blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Desiree Jennings case appears to be bringing out the absolute worst in many of the bloggers who oppose our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re tellin’ me. I even heard of this one organization called Generation Rescue who used their unofficial blog, Age of Autism, to exploit Ms. Jennings’ tragedy as part of a massive propaganda campaign to sell a whole bunch of pseudo-scientific crap to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example, I read a post by Dr. Steven Novella where he “reported” on a string of events involving Generation Rescue and the Desiree Jennings case that had no basis in reality and was simply false. We have neurologists breaking tabloid-level stories? Dr. Novella as investigative journalist? Too funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there go those scare quotes again. Classic Handley. Of course Dr. Novella actually IS a neurologist and thus is exactly the kind of person whose professional opinions we should be listening to in this case. As are the neurologists and dystonia advocacy groups he consulted. But no, you think it’s hilarious that anyone should listen to actual experts when they can listen to some non-expert on the internet with a clear professional bias. This isn’t a “tabloid” story; it’s a story that is directly rooting in medical science and specifically in the field of neurology. Point me to a single expert in that field who will back up your position and provide sufficient evidence for it. Where are they, J.B.? The experts agree that not only is Ms. Jennings not suffering from dystonia at all (as your organization directly claimed), but that there’s no precedent for her symptoms ever occuring as a result of a vaccine (as your organization directly claimed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenging Ms. Jennings’ original diagnosis of dystonia. Since when do doctors make long-distance video-only diagnoses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the symptoms don’t even come close to resembling the alleged original “diagnosis.” That’s like calling out doctors for disagreeing with a diagnosis of AIDS when the patient clearly shows only symptoms of cancer. It’s kind of a no-brainer there. &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/age-of-autism-applies-special-pleading-projectionism-to-desiree-jennings-case/"&gt;But as I pointed out the last time you vultures made this complaint&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not only is Generation Rescue’s unofficial blog, Age of Autism, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1163"&gt;continuing to promote the lie that Generation Rescue is still actively helping Ms. Jennings&lt;/a&gt; despite the fact that they have no medical resources to do so, but &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/generation-rescue-supports-desiree-jennings-washington-redskin-cheerleader-disabled-by-.html"&gt;they have the audacity to express outrage &lt;/a&gt;at the medical and dystonia experts for speculating without having examined Jennings personally while they see no inconsistency in continuing themselves to wildly speculate on her condition despite their lack of medical expertise and obvious conflict of interest. Apparently, the anti-vaxxers see conflicts of interests everywhere except in their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot the most amusing part of Handley’s complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t these doctors realize, by offering up potentially false commentary on the nature of Ms. Jennings diagnosis in a story that has captivated the world, that they will one day be called to task for such a glaring breach of medical ethics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that’s you projecting again, J.B. And captivated the world? Are you serious? Her story was covered on one Fox News show and &lt;em&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/em&gt;. I’d bet real money that if you polled people on the street, 99 out of a 100 of them would have never even heard of Desiree Jennings. Get over yourself, Handley. The internet doesn’t have the bandwith to contain your enormous ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming Ms. Jennings condition is all in her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the irony! Condemning Doctors Novella and Gorski for misrepresenting your position when you so despicably &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1184"&gt;misrepresent their position&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming the flu shot couldn’t possibly cause her condition. Once again, how on earth does a long-distance doctor determine this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doctor DID determine this as this is merely your straw man to avoid addressing &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1152"&gt;their actual position&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally I try to refrain from making medical diagnoses in public cases – but Jennings has now inserted herself in to the anti-vaccine movement, and is using her own case to “warn about the dangers of vaccines.” To mitigate the damage to public health brought about by misinformation in this case, I think it is necessary to provide some expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also seems to be the consensus opinion of experts who have viewed this case. The &lt;a href="http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/dystonia___flu_vaccine/569.php"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; had this to say about the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the concern of individuals with dystonia as to whether or not to get a flu shot because of this reported case, we have sought the opinion of dystonia experts on this case. Based on the footage that has been shared with the public, it is their unanimous consensus that this case does not appear to be dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore highly unlikely that whatever Jennings is suffering from now had anything to do with the flu vaccine she received in August. Unfortunately, this is not stopping irresponsible news coverage or exploitation by anti-vaccinationists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now what’s YOUR EXCUSE for passionately defending an alleged diagnosis both without personally examining Jennings and in light of your not even being a doctor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hell with what doctors who did examine her actually determined, we are the only arbiters of truth. It’s nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s already your attitude about all doctors that disagree with you about vaccines (99% of all doctors in the world). But again, when the symptoms don’t even remotely resemble the alleged diagnosis, red flags are raised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennings does not display the type of movements that are consistent with dystonia. Her speech and movement are, however, very suggestive of a psychogenic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also seems to be the consensus opinion of experts who have viewed this case. The &lt;a href="http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/dystonia___flu_vaccine/569.php"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; had this to say about the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the concern of individuals with dystonia as to whether or not to get a flu shot because of this reported case, we have sought the opinion of dystonia experts on this case. Based on the footage that has been shared with the public, it is their unanimous consensus that this case does not appear to be dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a doctor says their patient broke their left foot while you can clearly see them walking perfectly but with motionless right arm dangling, you don’t throw up your hands and proclaim that well, the doctor who examined them can’t be wrong…but every other doctor is the world is completely 100% wrong about the efficacy and safety of vaccines. That’s just asshole dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Handley continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming she couldn’t possibly recover from a condition she didn’t even have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1195"&gt;Wrong again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were also careful to point out that this does not mean she is “faking”, that her symptoms are not real, and that she is not suffering from a genuine and debilitating disorder. Simply that the nature of the disorder is likely psychogenic and not due to any specific brain pathology, caused by a vaccine or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings claimed, however, that her doctors at Johns Hopkins diagnosed her with dystonia and concluded it was from the vaccine. We have only her word to take for this as her doctors, understandably (given the rules of confidentiality) have not made any public statements. Jennings could give them leave to do so, but apparently hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it came to light the vaccine adverse event reporting systems (VAERS) report that is likely the one Jennings made indicates from the hospital records that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The admitting neurologist felt that there was a strong psychogenic component to the symptomology, and made a final diagnosis of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday I predicted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, Jennings is now in the hands of the Generation Rescue anti-vaccine quacks. I predict that they will be able to “cure” her, because psychogenic disorders can and do spontaneously resolve. They will then claim victory for their quackery in curing a (non-existent) vaccine injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now exactly what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More unintentional irony on the part of Handley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s great to watch these “doctors” dig themselves into a bigger and bigger hole. I’m not sure doctors like David Gorski realizes how silly their comments look to the average American and how much they have exposed themselves as the true story of what Desiree went through emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, clearly it’s the “average American” whose scientific opinions are called for here, not the opinions of experts. Forget all that complicated science. Just say things that Joe Sixpack will understand regardless of how brick stupid it is. That’s the J.B. Handley way!&lt;/p&gt;

The author briefly mentioned the fact that expert meditators were able to avoid the attentional blink that lay people are prone to experiencing when barraged with rapidly presented visual stimuli.This brought up a question for me. Would expert meditators perform better on dual-tasks compared to age-matched subjects?I believe the answer is in the affirmative. My reasoning behind this hypothesis has to do with the fact that meditation not only strengthens attentional abilities, but fosters neural efficiency as well (dual-tasking is not about doing two things simultaneously, but more about doing one thing at a time at an extremely fast pace, thus creating an illusion as if one is doing two things at once). A 2007 study by Farb et. al has shown that meditation activates the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a region central to switching your attention. With the development of my dual-task paradigm underway I hope to prove that daily meditation practice can have beneficial effects when it comes to multi-tasking. If my prediction prove to be true, not only will this ancient practice developed thousands of years ago better our physical and emotional well-being, but help us keep afloat in the fast pace era of technology as well.

Mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the DNA in the nucleus of our cells, a legacy of their origin as free-roaming bacteria. Free radicals are very reactive, which means that they can tear apart the biochemical machinery of cells by reacting with crucial components. This free radical pollution is at the heart of the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging, which presents a large component of the aging process as essentially a runaway feedback loop: mitochondria damage themselves via their own free radicals, making them produce even more free radicals. This in turn leads to cells overtaken by that pollution, and which throw free radicals out into the body to cause widespread harm as the years pass. Thus mitochondria are considered to be important: changes in genes that alter the operation of mitochondria can cause dramatic shifts in life span in mice. Differences in mitochondrial biochemistry are correlated with differences in life span between similar species. Mitochondria are involved with cellular programmed death mechanisms,......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The paper was written by a number of the PIs on grants for $1K genome technology.While there is one short section on the problem of sample preparation, the heart of the paper can be found in the other headings: surface chemistryfluorescent labelsthe enzyme-substrate systemopticsthroughput versus accuracyread-length and phasing limitationsEach section is tightly written and well-balanced, with no obvious playing of favorites or bashing of anti-favorites present.  Trade-offs are explored &amp;amp; the dreaded term (at least amongst scientists) &amp;quot;cost models&amp;quot; shows up; indeed there is more than a little bit of a nod to accounting -- but if sequencing is really going to be $1K/person on an ongoing basis the beans must be counted correctly!I won&amp;#39;t try to summarize much in detail; it really is hard to distill such a concentrated draught any further.  Most of the ideas presented as possible solutions can be viewed as evolutionary relative to the current platforms, though a few exotic concepts are floated as well (such as synthetic aperture optics.  It is noteworthy that an explicit goal of the paper is to summarize the problem areas so that new minds can approach the problem; as implied by the section title list above this is clearly a multi-discipline problem.  It does somewhat suggest the question whether Nature Biotechnology, a journal I am quite fond of, was the best place for this.  If new minds are desired, perhaps Physical Review Letters would have been better.  But that&amp;#39;s a very minor quibble.Fuller CW, Middendorf LR, Benner SA, Church GM, Harris T, Huang X, Jovanovich SB, Nelson JR, Schloss JA, Schwartz DC, &amp;amp; Vezenov DV (2009).

&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9933"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male &amp;amp; Female&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Investigators&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;who are scientists, explorers, or adventurers with advanced degrees (Ph.D desired). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ideally, investigators would already be a team (husband and wife, co- workers) who fall somewhere between the FBI Agents on “The X Files” and “Indiana Jones”. One is a believer, the other a skeptic. One is driven by reason, science and empirical evidence, the other by feelings, intuitions and faith. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me stop you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What IS it with everyone wanting bloody PhDs?? Okay, sure, sure, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;I’m on a podcast&lt;/a&gt; that has featured at least TWO women with PhDs during its time. But I’m really getting quite a complex about being ‘&lt;em&gt;the one at the conference &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; the PhD&lt;/em&gt;.’  Not as if a PhD is going to &lt;em&gt;guarantee &lt;/em&gt;that you can hit a mark and look meaningfully down the camera and say &lt;strong&gt;’so… &lt;a href="http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/"&gt;what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get any more of this PhD-required nonsense, I’m going to start using someone’s tongue as a soap-dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if I &lt;em&gt;were &lt;/em&gt;to do this show, I’d only do it with both Richard Saunders and Dr Rachael Dunlop as my co-workers – and we’d want as much origami paper as we can carry and possibly a small pony and a box of ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give us the web address of the video you want us to check out. (i.e. http://www.youtube.com/): &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09_DgebNb9k"&gt;me eating a dangerous amount of Vegemite&lt;/a&gt;. Should give you a good idea of my mad skillz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Answer Following Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;* Question 1.&lt;br&gt;
Do you think there is any basis in fact for the End of Days Prediction in the Mayan and other cultures. If so, what is the basis of your belief? If not, why not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, go check out Ben Radford’s work on this – ‘&lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/091105-2021-doomsday.html"&gt;The Truth about 2012 Doomsday Hype&lt;/a&gt;‘. He even got within spitting distance of John Cusak and didn’t ask for two dollars, so he must be the sensible sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Don Yeomans, manager of NASA’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/asteroids/near-earth-object/"&gt;Near Earth Object&lt;/a&gt; office has &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/11/11/2012-nasas-scientific-reality-check/"&gt;produced a video and written an article&lt;/a&gt;, providing the scientific realities surrounding the celestial happenings of 2012. Wahhh, if it wasn’t for those gosh-darned NASA sorts…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also Brian Cox, demonstrating a remarkable amount of control when really, he should be dashing his brains out on the stupid of it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw9K0tI9mxc"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw9K0tI9mxc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 2.&lt;br&gt;
How much have you studied 2012 phenomena? What methodology have you used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typed in ‘&lt;a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/hippydoom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2012 oh my sodding god what a load of monkey cage debris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘ into Google. Seemed to work fine for me – sent me straight to the MySpace page of a Frank Zappa fan. What more can you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 3. Are you interested in other mysterious and unexplained phenomena?  If so, what is your methodology?*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m currently doing a Masters degree on a similar topic, but &lt;em&gt;that’s not a PhD&lt;/em&gt; and since we all know about your petty prejudices, so you know where you can put that question and I hope you use a corkscrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 4. What would you choose to explore regarding either 2012 or other unexplained phenomena?  Oddities, myths, truths?  What methodology would you use? *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably phone Dr Karen Stollznow and when she’s finished laughing and rolling on the floor, we’d go check out some&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kittiecatd/"&gt; kitten pics on Catherine’s site. &lt;/a&gt;What was the task you wanted us to do again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 5. What makes you more unique than other 2012 scholars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, APART from the fact I have two Masters degrees and no PhD? Fetch the soap…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see me wearing these boots. &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt;. Today a guy was so distracted, that he walked solidly into a pine tree when I was heading to the Curtin Uni library and we had to check that he didn’t have concussion.You don’t get that sort of entertainment on the telly these days! I’d say that’s skillz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Dr Rachie is more woman than even television can handle and I regularly crash the server when she’s on &lt;a href="http://www.2gb.com/"&gt;live streaming video with Richard on 2GB&lt;/a&gt;, and I have clogged up Twitpic with all the screenshots I’ve snapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Saunders, on the other hand, has to be kept in a separate envelope so he doesn’t get mixed up with his tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 6. Tell us something else that makes you interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I work with Richard Saunders on a podcast and he hasn’t killed me yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 7. Have you had other television experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There was that one time I fell out of a school bus window waving frantically when they were filming ‘&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minty_(TV_series)"&gt;Minty&lt;/a&gt;‘ down in Bunbury, but I suspect that was edited out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 8. What are your concerns in participating in the project? What are your hopes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Apart from the inevitable world peace and solution to the problem of social inequity and world hunger, I’m kind of hoping that we can break Richard’s usual polite reserve and have him completely go bonkers in the face of some of the claims. Additionally, if Dr Rachie and I can sabotage his trailer and repaper it completely in optical illusions and rubber pigs, it’d be savage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 9. How much time do you have to devote to this series? How flexible is your schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you get all three of us, I imagine we’ll stay long enough to interview everyone on the set for our podcast. That’s kind of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Question 10. Is there anything we haven’t asked that you would like to tell us?  If so, now is your chance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really think that after all those pro-paranormal programs that have been shown on the History channel and the dismal failure of the last X-Files movie, that you should just outright &lt;a href="http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/things.html"&gt;hire Mil Millington and his girlfriend for this show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, think about it. She’ll be yelling in German in some supermarket about how the tins of peaches are  forming a pyramid of power that will herald the end of the world, whilst he’s in the parking lot in a locked car just screaming and screaming and screaming. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;would be great television.&lt;/p&gt;

Since a part of the recent discussion is based on a paper I co-authored in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, it is probably incumbent on me to provide a little context.&lt;/p&gt;

It should be obvious, but still bears emphasizing, that redistributing the historic forcings between various short-lived species and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is mainly an accounting exercise and doesn’t impact the absolute effect attributed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (except for a tiny impact of fossil-derived CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on the fossil-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The headlines that stated that our work shows a bigger role for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; should have made it clear that this is at the expense of other short-lived species, not CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Indeed, the attribution of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/10/attribution-of-20th-century-climate-change-to-cosub2sub/"&gt;historical forcings to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that we made back in 2006 is basically the same as it is now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As is well known, methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is the greenhouse gas whose anthropogenic increase comes second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its 20th Century effect on climate. It is often stated that methane is ‘roughly 20 times more powerful’ as a greenhouse gas than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and this can refer to one of two (very different) metrics. If you calculate the instantaneous forcing for an equivalent amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. for a 1 ppmv increase in both), you find that the global forcing for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is about 23-24 times as large (depending slightly on the background assumed). Separately, if you look up the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in IPCC AR4 (the integrated forcing of a kg of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared to kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a 100 year period), you get a value of about 25. GWP is used to compare the effects of emissions today on climate in the future. The numbers are only coincidentally similar since the GWP incorporates both the weight ratio and the ratio of effective lifetimes in the atmosphere which roughly cancel for a 100 year time-horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-2-20.jpg" align="right" width="40%"&gt;In the Second Assessment report (1995), the GWP for methane was 21, and it was increased in AR4 because of a greater appreciation for the indirect effects of methane on atmospheric chemistry, and in particular its role as a tropospheric ozone precursor (since increasing methane leads to an increase in low level ozone). There is also an indirect effect on stratospheric water vapour where methane oxidation is a significant source of water in an otherwise very dry region. Both tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapour are effective greenhouse gases so including these indirect effects made the net effect of methane greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the standard ‘forcings bar chart’ such as seen in &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelforce/efficacy_fig28.gif"&gt;Hansen’s papers&lt;/a&gt;, or in TAR, or AR4 (&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-2-20.jpg"&gt;figure 2.20&lt;/a&gt;), each change in atmospheric composition is given a separate column. Thus ozone and aerosol effects are denoted separately. Starting off with a paper &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=sh00300h"&gt;we wrote in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, though, a different approach that is perhaps more useful to policy makers has also been adopted. This ‘emissions-based’ viewpoint  attributes the forcings to the actual emissions, rather than to the eventual concentration. Thus since some of the ozone increase is related to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, you get to include that under CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The other ozone precursors (carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds) can also now be blamed for a portion of the ozone impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-2-21.jpg" align="right" width="40%"&gt;This was incorporated into &lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/fig-2-21.jpg"&gt;figure 2.21&lt;/a&gt; in AR4, where it is clear that the impact of methane (once some indirect effects are included) is greater than you would have thought based on the ‘abundance’ viewpoint. Note the changes basically only affect the reactive species.  When thinking about the various metrics, the emissions-based view is more closely tied to GWP than the traditional abundance-based approach. A big difference is that GWP is looking forward in time, while emission-based forcings are looking back at historical events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing sophistication when it comes to attribution and GWP is strongly connected to the development of more comprehensive Earth System Models (ESM) in recent years. These are the descendants of the General Circulation Models of the climate that have been developed over the last 30 years, but that now include interactive atmospheric chemistry, aerosols (natural and anthropogenic) and sometimes full carbon cycles in the ocean and land surface. This extra machinery allows for new kinds of experiments to be done. Traditionally, in a GCM, one would impose atmospheric composition forcings by changing the concentrations of the species in the atmosphere e.g. the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level could be increased, you could add more sulphate, or adjust the ozone in the stratosphere etc. However, with an ESM you can directly input the emissions (of all of the relevant precursors) and then see what ozone levels or aerosol concentrations you end up with. This allows you to ask more policy-relevant questions regarding the net effects of a particular sector’s emissions or the impact of a specific policy on climate forcing and air pollution (&lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/40528"&gt;see here for a discussion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20091029/397943main_gas-aerosolchart_full.jpg" align="right" width="40%"&gt;Our new &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; paper (&lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=sh05500b"&gt;Shindell et al, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) expands on some of the earlier work (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/10/attribution-of-20th-century-climate-change-to-cosub2sub/"&gt;as was discussed here&lt;/a&gt;) and extended consideration of the indirect effects of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO (carbon monoxide) to aerosols as well. This is necessary since SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires oxidants to transform to sulphates (and so is affected by the perturbation of the chemistry by other emissions), and it takes into account the competition between nitrates and sulphates for ammonia (which means that there is a small anti-phasing effect – increasing sulphates tends to decrease nitrates and vice versa). When we did this, we found that methane’s impacts increased even further since increasing methane lowers OH and so slows the formation of sulphate aerosol and, since sulphates are cooling, having less of them is an additional warming effect. This leads to an increase in the historical attribution to methane (by a small amount), but actually makes a much bigger difference to the GWP of methane (which increases to about 33 – though with large error bars).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently &lt;a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi_2009.fig2.png"&gt;methane levels&lt;/a&gt; are relatively stable (despite small upticks in the last two years) and are running below IPCC projections made in 2001 (this of course is good news). However, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is at more than twice its pre-industrial concentration and so still presents a tempting target for emission reductions which, because of our new work and the relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere, will likely be a little more effective at reducing future forcings than previously thought. Given the value of methane as a fuel, it is likely that more of it will be captured (as in &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/11/10/2009-11-10_methane_gas_plan_a_royal_flush_for_borough.html"&gt;this recent story&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, however, is still increasing dramatically despite the slow down in the economy, and so current growth in radiative forcings is dominated by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that will very likely continue for decades. Despite our increasing appreciation of the role of other forcings (including land use for instance), the overwhelming driver of climate change in the 21st Century will be CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up post, I’ll discuss the sources of methane and the implications of the new results for attribution of climate forcing to different sectors (including agriculture), where there have been some very odd (i.e. wrong) recently published numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258003537309"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=3158">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2831eeb6362c189</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellany"/><category term="Personal"/><category term="Time"/><title type="html">Your Mental Image of Time</title><published>2009-11-12T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/11/11/your-mental-image-of-time/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to write about this for, well, some time: how do we visualize time?  What is the mental picture we have in our heads of this basic dimension of our existence?  This is bound to be one the the stranger posts of mine you’ve read, but, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking online I find basically no research or anything written on this subject, but I am quite certain that just about everyone has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; picture of time in their heads.  For me, it’s quite a visual one, and past events and for that matter future ones are all attached to my mental picture of the time continuum.  My notion of all history, from my own to that of the universe is inextricably linked with my internal mental images of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, as I have reflected on how I actually internally visualize time, I have found it to be somewhat bizarre.  Or maybe not – I don’t really know because I haven’t really explored this in one-on-one conversation with others and haven’t learned from anything written out there just how different my picture is from others’.  So here goes…I hope those of you out there who are intrigued or inspired by this will share their own images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing is that my mental picture of time changes depending on the time scale involved, from a microsecond to a minute to an hour, day, week, month, year, or many years.  Starting at the largest time scales, those of the cosmos, when I am looking back in time over billions of years I imagine the classical, boring sort of “time as a line” progressing from left to right, straight across my mental image.  As we zoom in to more recent cosmological time, though, millions of years, the line becomes more of a curve, and curving toward me.  But then, very oddly (and this pattern will repeat itself) when we get to the much more recent past, say the last few thousand years, the curve is revealed to be more of a strip of sorts and moving from down and to the right (that’s the best way I can express it) toward the upper left.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really strange: if I think of a time, say, 20 000 years ago, in my mental field of view it’s definitely off to the right, and as I refer to more recent times, the ribbon is such that more recent times are to the left of earlier times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not absolute: as we get to the last 2000 or so years, the earlier part is sort of coming straight at me, eventually becoming (you got it) a ribbon coming from the lower left to the upper right again.  If I am considering the period from the Renaissance to the present, for example, I see a more distant past as actually more distant, off to the left, coming closer in more recent times an moving left to right.  The future, on this time scale, goes off to my right sort of behind me (where I can’t see – duh!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay I have probably lost at least 2/3 of the people who started reading this.  Huh?  Either this is so alien to how they think of time they don’t really see what I am seeing, or don’t care, or think that this is so off that wall it’s not worth reading further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the rest of you, the next part is where it gets kind of interesting. My mental timeline/ribbon, which has been snaking from left to right and back across my mental  field of view, does a few more twists.  As I think of the time scale of my life which began in the early 1960’s (okay, 1959), those early 60’s years are sort of again coming straight at me, becoming a left-to-right ribbon in the 70’s and then definitely right-to-left by the mid 80’s.  The years from then to now flow from far away and to the right to nearby toward the left.  But they don’t cross the center of my mental picture – that’s the present.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we zoom in further, say to the past several years, the ribbon is a string of months going back.  As I view earlier and earlier months they recede, up and to the right, and merge with the ribbon of the decades.  Events, major and minor, are recallable by zooming into my past picture of then-present time. They are all there (the ones I remember, anyway), and freakily often I can remember the exact dates and times they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week to a few months ago is definitely on that ribbon, stretching up and to the right as we go further into the past.  But then we get to yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  Here the ribbon, which is segmented by lines marking the days, does a weird thing.  For a given day, the ribbon starts out straight in front of me, going up, as if I had to climb it, the hours marked off by lines.  The ribbon climbs up, into the darkness, reaching a peak and then, after midnight, descending down into the next day, week, month, and year, away from me, off into the distance in the left part of my mental view of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future, the near future anyway (years) is definitely to the left in my mind’s eye.  (And no, this whole post is not some sort of allegory of my personal political evolution…)  The long term future is unpopulated by memories or images of expectations or hopes, and snakes off to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this changes when we are talking about smaller time scales.  As I zoom into the present hour, to finer and finer scales it becomes more and more a straight line extending from left to right.  I can zoom in from here to any micro-time scale and it stays the same.  Somehow the left-right snaking curve is attached to particular memories, including my memories of historical events about which I have learned.  Micro-time is so non-specific that it doesn’t trigger the snaky ribbon time view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another oddity about me in particular is that I actually find it hard to use a standard calendar to keep track of appointments, important meetings etc.  I don’t &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; time on that seven-day table!  But with a few anchor dates in the future, gotten from standard calendars, I can quickly calculate intervening dates and their days of the week.  If I know I have an appointment on December 4, and an exam to give on December 7, I can see in my head what days they are and I do rather well remembering them.  But at this moment, for example, I cannot tell you what day of the week Christmas is (though I know next January 18 is a Monday…)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there will be plenty of eye-rolling at this possibly boring description of my mental view of time, but, as I say, I hope it will trigger lots of you out there to share your own.  If you really think about it (and I bet you probably have not) you so have *some* sort of picture in your head.  What is it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258003168642"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3564">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f921515ffdf52c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism Speaks misleads the public on the IACC’s stance on vaccine research</title><published>2009-11-12T02:14:43Z</published><updated>2009-11-12T02:14:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/js2DQDk3oCE/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1258003168641"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/11/cult_class_slid_under_radar_-.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93253ee278c74150</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">“‘Cult’ class slid under radar” - NY Post</title><published>2009-11-11T17:53:37Z</published><updated>2009-11-11T17:53:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/11/cult_class_slid_under_radar_-.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="New_York_Post_logo.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/New_York_Post_logo.png" width="81" height="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The NY Post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cult_class_lid_under_radar_pMN4Z4wCkvQ4NDe0Oq6P9L"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that a brain-training type programme had been taken up by dozens of schools in New York, despite its connections to the Dahn Yoga cult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A controversial teaching program linked to an alleged cult leader managed to slip into 44 New York City public schools because it didn't cost enough to trigger detailed background checks, school officials said yesterday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fees for the Brain Power program, developed by Seung Huen Lee, founder of Dahn Yoga -- said to help kids improve their focus -- were well under the $25,000 cutoff, said Education Department spokesman David Cantor.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dahn Yoga has been embroiled in a federal lawsuit in Arizona after dozens of former employees accused the organisation of cult-like practices.
