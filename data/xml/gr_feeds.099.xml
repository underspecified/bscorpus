Oddly enough, I had some issue with that. You may vote on issues all you want, and you can even vote on morality if you’d like, but &lt;em&gt;scientific reality is not a matter of opinion and cares not for the majority vote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Science Education has video of the moment where it becomes clear that Ms. Cargill, not happy enough to destroy biology for students, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5YWJAgJm2Q"&gt;proposes an amendment to creationize astronomy as well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/T5YWJAgJm2Q%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to her gives me the heebie-jeebies. About the astronomy standards, she says &amp;quot;…there are different estimates [of the age of the Universe]… they will be taught about 12 - 14 billion years ago, but this leaves it open a little bit to discuss how many billions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely clear from what she is saying that she is deliberately trying to weaken the teaching of the old age of the Universe. Another member queries her specifically, asking if this will open up astronomy to the teaching of literal Biblical creationism. Cargill then completely dodges the question, saying she is simply taking the language of the recommendations. But that language is &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; saying the Universe is old, and there is a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amount of uncertainty (actually, only about 120 million years) in the age estimate of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she did, to put it simply, is a crock. It is perfectly transparent what she wanted: to wedge open the door to allow the teaching of young-Earth creationism in the classroom, using the standard &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; creationist propaganda tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need I say it? Her amendment passed, 11 to 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel bad for any child entering the Texas public school system over the next ten years, and I sincerely hope that the Legislature of the Lone Star State is able to take away the ridiculous amount of power the BoE has. They are flaunting their violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United State of America (not to mention bending or breaking that pesky &amp;quot;false witness&amp;quot; Commandment), and &lt;a href="http://www.edutopia.org/textbook-publishing-controversy"&gt;their influence reaches well beyond their own state borders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;McDonald&amp;#39;s — never known for a delicate marketing touch — is about to  drop the mother of all campaigns on you, an everywhere-you-look,  invade-your-dreams ad campaign in support of its McCafé specialty  coffee drinks that will be not so much viral as bubonic. An estimated  $100-million mega-buy across TV, Web, radio, print, outdoor and social  media, the McCafé push beginning today will be, according to the  company, its biggest &amp;quot;menu initiative&amp;quot; since it began serving breakfast  in the 1970s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Neil feels that the acute accent is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This campaign has a bit of a language problem, doesn&amp;#39;t it? &amp;quot;McCafé&amp;quot; is hard to say — having three stressed syllables — and American audiences have almost no experience with diacritical marks, so the acute accent mark on the final é is going to leave some fast-fooders bewildered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact the company see the unfamiliar diacritic as an oppportunity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… the  campaign&amp;#39;s general-audience TV spot (DDB Chicago) features ordinary  people&amp;#39;s daily drudgery being transformed by a McCafé drink, so that  &amp;quot;commute,&amp;quot; becomes &amp;quot;commuté&amp;quot; and cubicle becomes &amp;quot;cubiclé.&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil quips: "That seems  somewhat lamé." Maybe so. But will a country that bought into &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002433.html"&gt;modish macrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut"&gt;heavy-metal umlauts&lt;/a&gt; be fazed by a few exoticizing acutes?

It is even sadder when that book store was not just a shop but also a center of local community, a place where people gathered to have coffee, talk, interact with boook authors, take art or yoga classes, participate in theater or children's activities. But the economic downturn is affecting everyone and &lt;a href="http://marketstreetbooks.com/" title=""&gt;Market Street Books&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Village was forced to close by May 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went there a couple of times last week, to commiserate with the employees and volunteers who were packing, wondering what the future will bring for them and picked up a couple of free books they were giving away. I also took with me a souvenir - one of the poems written last Easter, during their annual &lt;a href="http://marketstreetbooks.com/mediagallery/peepfest2009.html" title=""&gt;PeepFest&lt;/a&gt;. It so happened that the poem I picked, just a piece of typed paper attached to the window with Scotch tape, was written by one of the people who was in the store at the time, helping to pack. I asked her for permission to reproduce the poem online and she said Yes. So here it is, 'The Evolution of Peeps' by Katie Hayes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which came first, the egg or the peep?&lt;br&gt;
It's quite a tough question, the answer is deep.&lt;br&gt;
But the end all of answers, between me and you&lt;br&gt;
Is the thing that came first was the pile of goo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Peeps evolved on a marshmallow isle&lt;br&gt;
Selected for eons for their daring and guile&lt;br&gt;
And the earliest peeps looked different back then&lt;br&gt;
Like the sabertoothed Peep--which slept in the den!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the proud peepadactyls which travaled in flocks&lt;br&gt;
Unlike today's peeps, who travel in box.&lt;br&gt;
They lost their prehensile ears and their beaks&lt;br&gt;
Their penchant for flying, and fondness to screech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they all died away and no one knows why&lt;br&gt;
Some blame an asteroid that fell from the sky.&lt;br&gt;
Or possibly lava, or sulfuric rain&lt;br&gt;
I blame globalized tooth decay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bue there are no fossils of ancient peep brethren&lt;br&gt;
Instead there are mountains of hard sugar resin&lt;br&gt;
So we're never allowed to teach it in school&lt;br&gt;
Except as a theory - and not as a rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/the_evolution_of_peeps.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/StgmWKm_4s4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241617241782"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4861862010383531388">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4acb3de93592d65b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Culture" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Two Cultures in New York City</title><published>2009-05-06T12:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T13:45:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/two-cultures-in-new-york-city.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4861862010383531388/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4861862010383531388" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of a lecture by C.P.

To boil it down to its essence, crank magnetism is the phenomenon in which a person who is a crank in one area very frequently tends to be attracted to crank ideas in other, often unrelated areas. I had noticed this tendency long before I saw Mark's post, including one &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/understanding_alternative_medi_1.php"&gt;Dr. Lorraine Day&lt;/a&gt;, who, besides being a purveyor of quackery, is also a r&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/dr_lorraine_day_purveyor_of_woo_and_anti.php"&gt;abid anti-Semite and Holocaust denier&lt;/a&gt; who had treated arch-Holocaust Ernst Zündel with "alternative" therapies when he was in jail awaiting trial, and a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/dr_lorraine_days_at_it_again.php"&gt;conspiracy theorist&lt;/a&gt;. I had also noted that Peter Duesberg, perhaps the most famous HIV/AIDS denialist, had gone off the deep end pursuing an interesting but unproven idea about cancer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/peter_duesberg_chromosomal_chaos_and_can.php"&gt;far beyond what the evidence warranted&lt;/a&gt;. Mark had coined a punchy, clever term to describe the tendency. I stashed it away to be used when I feel the need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the need now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/melanie_phillips_crank_magnetism_in_acti.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/melanie_phillips_crank_magnetism_in_acti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Z7dTMdbGAhY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241616968793"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=531">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6c5a02850e3c727</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Homeopathy Kills</title><published>2009-05-06T13:22:01Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T13:22:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=531" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those who advocate for strict scientific standards in medicine are often asked, “what’s the harm” of someone pursuing unconventional medicine? If people want to engage in a little hope, even if it’s a false hope, it might make them feel better and it won’t cause any harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the questioner assumes that the unscientific remedies are themselves harmless. This is not always a reasonable assumption. Some unscientific treatments are directly harmful, or carry a non-trivial risk. But that is not the limit to the harm that can be caused by pursuing such remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the biggest harm of unscientific medicine is that it fosters a distruct of science-based medicine and practitioners and faith in bizarre notions of health and illness and in treatments that do not work. Someone who feels that acupuncture helpe their back pain may then rely upon it when they get cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathic treatments (real ones, not products labeled homeopathic but containing real drugs) are certainly harmless. They have no side effects because they have not effects - they are just water and sugar pills. Most homeopathic dilutions are such that chances are not a single molecule of the “active” ingredient remains behind. Or, more acurately, the original assortment of molecules that can be found in all water are there, but that’s it. Homeopathy is literally nothing but pure magical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But homeopathy can still kill. Thomas Sam, a homeopath, and his wife, Manju Sam, are standing trial in an Australian court for manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. They allowed their 9 month old child to die from complications of severe eczema. &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-babys-parents-ignored-advice-qc-20090504-asmt.html?page=1"&gt;According to reports&lt;/a&gt;, their daughter, Gloria, was healthy at birth. But at 4 months old she developed a skin rash, which became progressively worse. Sam decided to treat the eczema with homeopathic treatments - which means not to treat it at all. He sought advice from other homeopaths and naturopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also refused to follow the advice of the child’s pediatrician to take her to skin specialist to get more aggressive treatment. As a result Gloria’s eczema worsened. Her skin became thin and cracked, resulting in infections, and eventually septicemia and death. Standard medical treatments could have saved her right up until days before her death. This seems to be a case of ideology trumping common sense, evidence, and all reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sad case is an extreme example, but it is not an isolated case. Similar cases occur with adults, in which case there is no legal issue of neglect. The website &lt;a href="http://theness.com/whatstheharm.net"&gt;whatstheharm.net&lt;/a&gt; documents the stories of many similar cases. Because of my blogs and podcast I also receive many e-mails from family members who are standing by helplessly while a loved-one slowly dies from a treatable disease because they are enthralled by an unscientific practitioner and their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some defend unscientific practices by saying that they should be used in addition to science-based medicine rather than instead of it. I agree that this is a safer option - forgoing all science-based medicine is the most extreme and dangerous approach. But that does not mean that the “integrative” approach is safe or reasonable. In practice those who are ideologically dedicated to treatments that cannot be supported by evidence or basic science seek or prescribe such treatments first, delaying access to proven therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other sources of indirect harm. Expending resources of time, money, effort, and emotion on treatments that do not work reduce the resources available for treatments that do work. Also I find that unscientific therapies are often accompanied by gross misinformation about biology and medicine. They also thrive, as I stated above, on mistrust of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how promoters try to sugar coat it, unscientific treatments are harmful to the system and to individuals. Occasionally, as with the case of Gloria Sam, we hear of a dramatic example. But the harm from unscientific health claims are not limited to these media-friendly cases.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a good cause: grants are being given for preservation of historic places in Boston. But they're &lt;a href="http://www.partnersinpreservation.com/boston/"&gt;allocating funds on the basis of votes in an internet poll&lt;/a&gt;! This isn't even a proper popularity contest, because polls are so easily skewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, go vote. I went for the New England Aquarium for obvious reasons, but there are several worthy sites: a museum of African American history, for instance, or a ballet theatre. There are even churches (lots of churches) on the list, and despite my biases there, I wouldn&amp;#39;t even count those out, if they are of historical value. The Old North Church is there — that&amp;#39;s worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, what a weird way to distribute funds. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better to do this with an informed committee, that could actually look at need and value objectively? Maybe the New England Aquarium is flush with money, while the Salem Old Town Hall is crumbling into disrepair…I don&amp;#39;t know! And they&amp;#39;re asking &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; to determine who gets a grant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's not a pointless poll. It's just a misdirected poll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/a_non-pointless_poll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UqUVpXr6cIM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241614001877"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/mormon_ghoulishness_exposed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f6fc24193533f6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Mormon ghoulishness exposed</title><published>2009-05-06T13:21:23Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T13:21:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pECMPH5OOL8/mormon_ghoulishness_exposed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/mormon_ghoulishness_exposed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five months before the election, and thirteen years after her death, &lt;a href="http://www.americablog.com/2009/05/abc-news-mormons-baptized-obamas.html"&gt;the Mormon Church posthumously baptized Barack Obama's mother into their church&lt;/a&gt;. This is a common practice. It's harmless and stupid, but it does highlight the fact that the church is a collection of ghouls. They're also chronic liars about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mormon Church spokeswoman Kim Farah said that &lt;span&gt;"the offering of baptism to our deceased ancestors is a sacred practice to us and it is counter to Church policy for a Church member to submit names for baptism for persons to whom they are not related. The Church is looking into the circumstances of how this happened and does not yet have all the facts. However, this is a serious matter and we are treating it as such."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s lying. The church is slack about who submits the names — they maintain vast genealogical records, records that are continually growing as they scavenge the world for more information, and they rather freely toss the names into the baptismal font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They only regard it as a serious matter because they've been caught at it. It's one good sign: they have a little bit of shame left. But, you know, it's kind of like visiting the graveyard and discovering that a ghoul has dug up your grandma; maybe he looks a bit abashed and quickly hides a gnawed-upon femur behind his back, but that wins him no sympathy and you still have to choke back your disgust and revulsion, and resist the urge to kick him until he is bruised and bloody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/mormon_ghoulishness_exposed.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pECMPH5OOL8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241613466032"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/05/things-you-learn-at-pubquiz/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7bd7ab04f9e83e47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">things you learn at #pubquiz: …</title><published>2009-05-06T12:04:07Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T12:04:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/05/things-you-learn-at-pubquiz/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;things you learn at #pubquiz: the Argentinian Blue Billed Duck has an 8 inch penis&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241613238069"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1125745379484613216">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed647de1c7f2d58f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">On the Origin of Chloroplasts</title><published>2009-05-06T12:20:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T12:33:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-origin-of-chloroplasts.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1125745379484613216/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1125745379484613216" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> We know that many species contain chloroplasts.

When an epidemic spreads to multiple regions, especially multiple countries or continents, it becomes a pandemic. Flu pandemics happen 2-3 times each century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably partly why there has been so much news attention, even some mild hysteria, surrounding recent outbreaks of swine flu, beginning in Mexico. It is hard to say how many cases and how many deaths there have been so far, because information from Mexico is spotty. Specifically it is difficult to say if people who have died with flu-like symptoms really had the swine flu or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates are that more than 800 people have contracted the swine flu in Mexico with 29 confirmed deaths, although none in the last week.  The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;(CDC) reports as of May 5th that there have been 403 confirmed cases in the United States, with the first death just reported. World-wide there have been 1,490 cases in 21 countries (according to the &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;- WHO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Background on Influenza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza or flu virus is an RNA virus that comes in three genera - A, B, and C. Influenza A is the most common type. It can infect mammals and birds, with aquatic birds being its natural endemic host. Each year there is a seasonal epidemic of Influenza A, infecting millions of people world-wide and killing 100-200,000 - mostly the very old, the very young, and the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza B is less common than A and infects only humans, seals and ferrets. Influenza B mutates slower than A, and so has less genetic diversity and is less virulent as a result. Influenza C infects humans, dogs, and pigs and is the least common type, but can be virulent when outbreaks occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the pandemics over the last century have been of Influenza A. Its primary weapon is its ability to rapidly mutate, avoiding the immune systems of its hosts. This is why each year new strains of Influenza A are causing that season’s epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu starts out like a common cold, but lasts longer and becomes more severe. It is characterized by high fevers, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, and severe cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A strains are designated by the two main proteins that determine their infectivity and virulence -haemaglutanin and neuraminidase, H and N. There are 16 Hs but only H 1-3 infect humans, and there are 9 Ns but only 1 and 2 infect humans. Haemaglutanin is a protein that allows the virus to latch onto and infect host cells, while neuraminidase allows expelled viruses to reinfect other cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu is potentially a fatal illness, killing about 1% of those infected. Death results from one of three types of causes - the flu infection itself can cause a serious pneumonia (lung infection) that can impair breathing to the point of death. A serious infection can also leave someone open to a superinfection (another organism causing a second infection while the host’s immune system is occupied with the flu). And those who have a chronic underlying illness may succumb from the added physiological stress added by the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Current Swine Flu &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swine flu virus is Influenza A H1N1. This strain came about probably by four different strains of Influenza A infecting the same host (probably a pig, hence the name swine flu). Viruses can exchange genetic material, so one strain can combine bits from other strains, creating a new strain. The current swine flu likely combined bits from a human virus, a bird virus, and two swine viruses, although this is still being confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there are 8 gene segments in the Influenza A virus that can be shared among different strains. Typically these reassorted viruses are weak strains when they first come into existence. Their genes have just been mixed, with unpredictable results, and they have not yet had time to optimize the new assortment. But once these new viruses start spreading they evolve quickly as they are fine-tuned by selective pressure to be more infective and hardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how the current H1N1 became so virulent so quickly - it is already adapted for human-to-human spread. It is also not clear if it has the potential to cause a pandemic. We do not yet know what specific mutations allow an Influenza virus to cause a pandemic so even though we have isolate the virus we cannot directly tell how dangerous it is. Likely this strain will need to undergo further mutations in order to have pandemic potential. However, during an outbreak, when the viruses is rapidly multiplying and spreading, it mutates quickly, increasing the chance of a mutation to pandemic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should We Worry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week on the SGU we &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=197"&gt;interviewed Mark Crislip&lt;/a&gt;, and infectious disease doctor, host of &lt;a href="http://www.quackcast.com/"&gt;Quackcast&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the authors here at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed in detail the latest swine flu outbreak, and what level of concern is currently appropriate. The bottom line is this - this is a new strain of flu virus which appears to be spreading. It is not yet known if it has the capability of producing a world-wide pandemic, but it might and if it does it could theoretically rise to the level of the 1918 pandemic which killed millions. Some of the reported deaths from Mexico were young healthy adults (which was also common in the 1918 pandemic), which can mean that the strain is virulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is too early to tell. This epidemic may also fizzle out quickly, ultimately affecting very few. In 1976 there was a swine flu epidemic with concerns that it would be the next big pandemic, but it just fizzled and amounted to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determines whether this latest strain with be a bang or a bust is how infectious it is (how many people with catch the virus) and how virulent it is (how may infected people will die from the infection). We do not yet know how this current swine flu will behave - we don’t have enough data points yet. Probably we will not know until the pandemic is underway, or until after it has burnt itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time there is no reason to panic or make major changes in your lifestyle. The WHO and the CDC are watching closely and will make recommendations. At present the CDC recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are sick are urged to stay home from work or school and to avoid contact with others, except to seek medical care. This action can avoid spreading illness further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it - they are not recommending that we limit international travel or that we start shutting down schools. Essentially, if you have a cold or flu-like illness, don’t tough it out and go to work - stay home and seek medical care if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO has &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/travel/en/index.html"&gt;similar recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. They are not recommending limiting travel at this time. While not explicitly recommending the use of masks in public, they also provide &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Adviceusemaskscommunityrevised.pdf"&gt;guidance as to how to properly use a mask&lt;/a&gt;. The same document also details general recommendations to avoid spreading the infection - wash your hands, keep a meter away from symptomatic individuals, stay home if you are sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico, which has been hardest hit so far, shut down schools, museums, and public places for 5 days. They even canceled their Cinco de Mayo celebrations. However, they claim that new cases in Mexico are already past their peak and therefore the epidemic is slowing down. They have lifted their restriction and are trying to get their economy back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where we are today. If the infection continues to spread and show signs that it is developing into a pandemic, the WHO and CDC will update their recommendations. There are some possible signs already that this outbreak will not be the next major pandemic. &lt;a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP468702.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Early numbers indicate that this strain is no more infectious or virulent than the usual seasonal flu strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some warn that we are not yet out of the woods. New cases are still being reported.  The WHO also pointed out that in the 1918 pandemic there was a second wave of a more virulent strain of the virus, and it was this second wave that caused the pandemic. So we may be in store for a second wave of H1N1 in a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most alarming warning I have read comes from Yi Guan, who is famous for identifying the SARS virus in 2003. &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/504/1"&gt;In a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; he criticized the WHO for not reacting quickly enough to the outbreak in Mexico. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO should have gone to level 4 or even level 5 on Friday. We missed the golden period to contain the virus. Several hours could be another couple hundred cases. Every second was valuable at that time. We made a huge mistake. From then on, it was countdown to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guan also warns that the H1N1 may combine with the H5N1 strain, which has a 50% mortality rate. He says this is very  very unlikely, but if it does happen it will be a “nightmare for the whole world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore at present the ultimate fate of H1N1 will be determined by how it mutates and combines with other strains - unpredictable events. At this point all we can do is monitor the outbreak closely and react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are treatments for the swine flu. This strain will respond to certain anti-viral drugs, which may decrease the severity of the illness and decrease the mortality. The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/antiviral.htm"&gt;CDC has this to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four influenza antiviral drugs approved for use in the United States (oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine and rimantadine). The swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses that have been detected in humans in the United States and Mexico are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine so these drugs will not work against these swine influenza viruses. Laboratory testing on these swine influenza A (H1N1) viruses so far indicate that they are susceptible (sensitive) to oseltamivir and zanamivir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no vaccine for this strain, and it will take several months to mass produce one. Depending on the timing of the outbreak this may or may not be in time - but if it is a serious outbreak it will likely last several months, so the vaccine will come out toward the end. The role of the vaccine, therefore, may be to shorten the pandemic, but not to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that flu vaccines are still manufactured with 50 year old technology, using chicken eggs. This is a time consuming process. It will likely take a couple of years to make enough vaccine to inoculate the world against the swine flu. There are companies working on developing newer technologies - where vaccine can be mass produced in vats - but any new technology will not be ready for this pandemic, if it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Swine Flu Hubbub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the media has treated the swine flu with near panic. And not just the media - governments and health organizations like the WHO and CDC are stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they overreact to the potential threat then they are accused of being hysterical. The US government and CDC were soundly criticized for sounding the alarm bells in 1976 when that swine flu amounted to nothing. Yet, if they under-react we could be left unprepared for the next major pandemic. Mark Crislip argued, and I agree, it is better to be a little over-prepared than a little under-prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already the WHO is being criticized for overreacting to this swine flu. In response &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e6260d9a-37d4-11de-9211-00144feabdc0.html"&gt;WHO officials warn&lt;/a&gt; that there could be a second wave of swine flu outbreaks in a month or two - which is what happened in 1918. And as I stated above, they are simultaneously being criticized for not reacting fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on pointing fingers at this stage of the game, the WHO, CDC, and world governments should simply plan prudently for a pandemic, and then hope to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the hysteria is countries fighting with each other. Mexico is getting a little defensive that travel and exports from Mexico may be restricted - so maybe they are downplaying the number and severity of cases to avoid this. Other countries, even old allies, are bickering over recommendations for travel restriction. Concerns have already been raised that the UK might horde their flu vaccines, leaving the US high and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the purpose of an organization like the WHO is to coordinate international information and efforts to avoid this very type of national bickering in times of a world-wide health crisis. Although the media may give the impression of chaos, behind the headlines the recommendations and actions of the CDC and WHO are all reasonable and prudent. I am optimistic that when the next big pandemic hits the WHO, CDC and similar organizations will rise to the task and do what is necessary.The question is - is there anything that can be done to avoid a pandemic, or do we have to ride it out and take steps to minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, with swine flu grabbing headlines the quacks and cranks have come out of the woodwork to exploit the situation to push their woo and pseudoscience. Offers for snake oil for the swine flu infected spam last week, accounting for 2% of all spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post, rapidly becoming the leader of health pseudoscience on the web, has had several recent posts recommending every sort of dubious health treatments and preventions for the swine flu. Orac at Respectful Insolence &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;does a nice takedown&lt;/a&gt; of the swine flu woo over at the HuffPo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the &lt;a href="http://www.kxan.com/dpp/health/swine_flu_conspiracy_theories_swirl"&gt;conspiracy theorists have to have their say&lt;/a&gt; as well. They can see the Truth behind the hype that the swine flu was manufactured as part of the latest government dark cabal conspiracy to control the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present there is no cause to panic over the swine flu. Yes - this could be a serious outbreak, but we just have to wait and see. So far the early signs are already indicating this will not be a major pandemic, and may already be on the way out. But we still have to watch closely to see which way it will go. The CDC and WHO will be the best sources of information in the coming weeks. I would avoid the day-to-day roller-coaster of mainstream media headlines and focus on the official reports and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best recommendations are to take simple and rational steps to avoid getting infected, or if symptomatic to avoid spreading the infection to others. This means staying home if you are sick with flu-like symptoms. Wash your hands before and after using public facilities or contact with others who may be infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if the swine flu of 2009 proves to be like the 1976 fizzle, eventually we will be hit with another pandemic. For every pandemic there are likely to be a dozen false alarms. The public should not be dismayed by these false alarms nor should they lose faith in the CDC and WHO when early warnings do not pan out. Their job is to keep their eye on early outbreaks, knowing most will not amount to a pandemic, but waiting for the one that will.&lt;/p&gt;

Among the Miskito People of eastern Central America, the condition known as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grisi_siknis"&gt;Grisi Siknis&lt;/a&gt;" has afflicted dozens, spreading like an epidemic through the population - especially the young. But no medical cause can be established, and no medical treatment has been demonstrated to work reliably. Indeed, the only people who can successfully treat the disease are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito"&gt;Miskito&lt;/a&gt; herbalists and witch-doctors. The disease shares many common features with a number of mysterious conditions affecting people in the developed world: are these examples of a class of disease that only alternative medicine can cure? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition spreads like the flu, but seems to target a specific demographic - teenagers, usually girls and usually between the ages of 15 and 18. The patients go into a manic frenzy, feelings of anger, fear or anxiety giving way to a loss of control. Often the victim becomes violent, and almost "superhuman", performing feats of strength or ignoring bodily injuries. A common feature is a feeling of threat - the victims feel as if they are under attack from some unknown spirits. &lt;i&gt;Grisi siknis&lt;/i&gt; translates as "crazy sickness", and that neatly sums up the condition - the patient goes crazy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Pablo McDavis, a researcher into the disease based in the area, was &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8007895.stm"&gt;quoted recently as being perplexed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have taken samples of blood from patients while suffering an attack and, in a lab, we can't detect anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Drugs or injections tend to only increase a patient's aggressiveness. Clinically we can't detect anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is like an outbreak. If an attack is not contained quickly, it can spread throughout an entire community." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief in spirits, curses and black magic is very strong among the Miskito population, and those afflicted turn to local healers and witch doctors. These people claim that the condition is treatable - a potion either consumed or bathed in can apparently cure the disease in the space of a few days. Many in the community believe that the healers are &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8007895.stm"&gt;lifting a curse from the victims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to take a sort of patronising view of this tribe and their mystery illness, but actually we've got no right to be smug, because a whole litany of similar conditions affect cultures all over the world including our own. These conditions are collectively termed "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome"&gt;culture bound syndromes&lt;/a&gt;", and what marks them out as unusual is that while the victims appear to be displaying genuine psychological and physical problems, the syndrome is only recognised within a specific culture (while being completely unheard of in others), and none of the symptoms can be detected by medical tests or observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include the infamous "penis panics" in West Africa, in which sufferers believe that some person or spirit has stolen their favourite appendage; &lt;a&gt;Morgellons&lt;/a&gt; in the United States (although it could almost &lt;a href="http://morgellonswatch.com/"&gt;be described as an Internet disease&lt;/a&gt;), which is most likely simply delusional parasitosis; Fan Death in South Korea, in which people believe that electric fans left on overnight can cause death by suffocation, poisoning, or hypothermia, through some unknown mechanism; Arctic hysteria in Eskimos (although this could conceivably be due to Vitamin A poisoning); and many other fascinating examples - enough to fill many more blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science-based medicine relies on the tangible - no amount of samples and measurements can help you when there is nothing to measure. Clinical trials would probably conclude that the potions of the witchdoctors' potions worked, but they may not shed much light on the mechanisms involved. Instead, culturally-bound syndromes have been classified as psychiatric conditions. The American Psychiatric Association say [2]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The term culture-bound syndrome denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be 'illnesses,' or at least afflictions, and most have local names. Althought presentations conforming to the major DSM-IV categories can be found throughout the world, the particular symptoms, course, and social response are very often influenced by local cultural factors. In contrast, culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or culture areas and are localized, folk, diagnostic categories that frame coherent meanings for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences and observations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem for Doctors using the principles of evidence-based medicine is that this is not an evidence-based disease. It exists only within the context of the patients personal and cultural understanding of the body and disease. This means that the doctor has to be able to do one of three things, which are in turn ignorant, unethical, or likely to be ineffective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is for the doctor to genuinely share the beliefs of the patient, and offer the appropriate folk medicine treatment. Clearly this is pretty much a non-starter for modern doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is to try to educate the patient to see the condition the way that the doctor sees it. The problem with this is that at best it's unlikely to work - one doctor's opinion is unlikely to overturn decades of cultural learning - and at worst it can be downright offensive to sufferers. Many people who believe they have Morgellons for example are told by their doctors that they have "delusional parasitosis", but this isn't a very nice diagnosis to hear - nobody wants to have it suggested to them that they're delusional. As a result, patients may refuse the appropriate treatments, creating a serious dilemma for the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third approach is for the doctor to pretend to share the patient's understanding of the disease, and to then offer either the folk medicine treatment or a medical alternative: &lt;i&gt;"oh yes, aspirin are very good for dispelling evil spirits."&lt;i&gt; The problem with this approach is that it's regarded as deeply unethical - the doctor-patient relationship is supposed to be built on trust, and for a doctor to deliberately lie to a patient about their illness or treatment is abhorrent in the eyes of many (and let's not ignore the possibility of getting sued at some later stage).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us all the way across to the issue of the placebo effect in modern medicine. Many common complaints have a strong psychological component - back pain for example - and in these cases quack medicine and the placebo effect can be a great help. Again though doctors run into thorny ethical dilemmas - placebos work best when given by deception, and deception runs against medical ethics. It's a debate that I suspect will rumble on for years. Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/03/all-bow-before-the-might-of-the-placebo-effect-it-is-the-coolest-strangest-thing-in-medicine/"&gt;neatly summed-up the dilemma&lt;/a&gt; in a column last year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sugar pills are the future, if only there was a way to give them with integrity, and a straight face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a dilemma of course that doesn't affect the US$60bn alternative medicine industry, and indeed it's in scenarios like this that quackery survives and thrives. Alternative medicine practitioners don't have to demonstrate that they're product works, or provide evidence of efficacy or even biological explanations. Freed from ethical and scientific obligations they can more directly connect with the patient's own ideology to provide the desired treatment. The question is, how far down that road should conventional medicine go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been listening a lot to &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/damntheband"&gt;Damn!&lt;/a&gt;'s fourth album, &lt;i&gt;Let's Zoom In&lt;/i&gt;, that was released last year. Damn! is an unfortunately namned soul/funk octet from Malmö in southern Sweden, mostly known as a backing band for rapper Timbuktu. Excellent stuff, among the best music the country has to offer! Though the album's main single played in the live clip above is a shouting-blues type of thing, most of it is dominated by ultra-smooth Curtis Mayfield style falsetto singing. And there's a lot of kraftwerkesque vocoder on it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained to my wife yesterday, a vocoder is a beautiful thing when it's used to make people sound like robots. This is not the same as the ugly digital re-pitching that is so common in current mass-market R'n'B. A typical example can be heard on the male part of the gratuitous duet version of Beyoncé's lovely "If I Were A Boy". A vocoder turns you into a robot. If you can't sing in tune or if you have an insufficient reach, then the vocoder won't help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/damn_good_swedish_soul.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/t4botRy3GGo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241605135123"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1409">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/739089ff2cbb887a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">Mahler's score markings</title><published>2009-05-06T10:20:15Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T10:20:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1409" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/"&gt;David Pesetsky&lt;/a&gt;, the Ferrari P.

"Celebrity" comes from the Latin word &lt;i&gt;celeber&lt;/i&gt;, meaning "&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0060:entry=ce%5Ele_%5Ebro"&gt;to frequent, throng, crowd.&lt;/a&gt;" Celebrities are called celebrities because they attract throngs of people---crowds---in droves---and not necessarily for any reason that they're famous or, in many a case, &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt;famous. It's generally accepted that one doesn't have to have any special talents to be a celeb. Get the attention of the public, get written up by &lt;a href="http://perezhilton.com/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/"&gt;gossip&lt;/a&gt; blog that's the digital equivalent of Liz Smith or Walter Winchell (in the days when writing a gossip column meant &lt;i&gt;writing&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;column&lt;/i&gt; of print in a &lt;i&gt;paper&lt;/i&gt;) and bingo, &lt;i&gt;you're it&lt;/i&gt; (as in "it girl").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the public cynosure do tend to be (and indeed have been since the days of the ancient Greeks and Romans) actors and actresses; entertainers. (The Romans didn't speak of &lt;i&gt;spectacula&lt;/i&gt;---"spectacles," from the Latin word for "watch," &lt;i&gt;spectare&lt;/i&gt;---for nothing.) And the power of association being what it is in our ad-financed world, it's pretty accepted that if you've got celebs, you're gonna have people wanting to ride on their fame (from the Latin &lt;i&gt;fama&lt;/i&gt;, meaning "rumor") to get themselves noticed; to get their cause noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would UNESCO have been without Audrey Hepburn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aid to Africa without Bono?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jerry Lewis Telethon without &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/celebrities_awareness_and_why_jerry_lewis_shouldnt_win_that_award"&gt;Jerry Lewis&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now wait a moment----what cause exactly where those entertainers associated with? We do remember the famous name and face, but what were they "advocating" for and what difference did they, are they, making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon continues today, when celebrities continue to step up to the plate and in the name of autism (for example) do PSAs and march in rallies and "advocate" on TV talk shows (some have even, 'tis heard tell, signed contracts for their own TV talk shows). Very good for the entertainment factor and to keep the buzz alive, so long as we remember, that it's celebrities spewing out their views (kind of like blogging......) about various topics, &lt;i&gt;et c'est tout&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics from science will no doubt be brought up when autism is under discussion. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluating_research_papers_studies_and_reports"&gt;evaluation of research papers, studies, and reports&lt;/a&gt; isn't, let's face it, very sexy and more power to those who think they've a way to enliven the mundane operations of downloading PDF files and reading them (with frequent reference to dictionaries and such, in my case) slowly. Careful evaluation of science doesn't translate at all into sound bytes, it must be noted; indeed, much gets lost in the translation of science into articles and press releases and such for the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And science is from &lt;i&gt;scire&lt;/i&gt;, Latin for "to know," and knowledge comes when it will, and often slowly, after long-term study and careful application of principles, axioms, and information previously acquired and thoroughly absorbed and often in the quiet of a desk heaped in books and papers in the light of midnight oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And far, far from the madding crowd and the cult of celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;

The two papers come to completely opposite conclusions regarding the long term trend. So which one (if either) is right, then? And does it really matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is a very familiar one when it comes to long-time series from satellite data. Each individual satellite only lasts a few years, and so a 30 year time series needs to be stitched together from a series of satellites. Each of those instruments might have a different calibration, and may have non-climatic drifts associated with instrument degradation, or orbital effects. Thus it can often be the case that there is a degree of ambiguity in putting together the series. This issue is at least part of the difference between the RSS and UAH tropospheric temperature trends, and in the CERES/ERBE analyses &lt;a href="http://chriscolose.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/lindzen-on-climate-feedback/"&gt;discussed recently&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between PMOD and ACRIM have already been discussed by the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/acrim-pmod-sun-getting-hotter.htm"&gt;SkepticalScientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/pmod-vs-acrim/"&gt;Tamino&lt;/a&gt;, so here is just an update in the light of the two recent papers. The important issue here is the so-called ‘ACRIM-gap’, the time between the ACRIM-I instrument ceased and when the ACRIM-II observations started (mid-1989 to late 1991), and how the data from these two instruments are combined using other overlapping observations. Note that the ‘ACRIM’ name for the Willson et al time-series simply implies that it was put together by some people on the ACRIM science team, not that they use different satellite data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on these papers is what the ‘ACRIM gap’ implies for TSI levels during the solar minimum at solar cycles 21 and 22. Whereas PMOD suggests that the TSI levels during these minima are similar, ACRIM suggests that the TSI level is higher during the minimum of cycle 22. SW08 even claim that there has been a positive ‘&lt;em&gt;minima trend&lt;/em&gt;‘. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LF08 conclude that the PMOD is more realistic, since the change in the TSI levels during the solar minima, suggested by ACRIM, is inconsistent with the known relationship between TSI and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). It is well-known that the GCR flux is generally low when the level of solar activity is high, because the solar magnetic fields are more extensive and these shield the solar system against GCR (charged particles). However the two effects don’t always go in lockstep, so this is suggestive rather than conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also clear from the instrumental data that the TSI tends to increase with the solar activity level – at least over the solar cycle. LF08 argue that if the ACRIM ‘minimum trend’ is correct, this will  mean that past reconstruction of TSI based on e.g. sunspots are incorrect, and a lot of studies on the past climate variations would be wrong. This does not mean that the ACRIM data are useless, but that there are uncertainties regarding the relationship TSI-levels, solar activity for different time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found insufficient detailed description in SW09 of the methodology used in their analysis to be able to judge the real merit of their work. The paper provides a link to auxiliary material that does not work. However, the figures in the paper don’t really convince when I don’t know how they were made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I found the SW09 a bit confusing, as it gives the impression that the PMOD composite relies on ERBS/ERBE data during the ACRIM-gap (“The PMOD team uses the sparse ERBS/ERBE data base to ‘bridge’ the ACRIM gap, conforming the higher cadence Nimbus 7/ERB to it by making adjustments due to …”). However the information in LF08 says PMOD used HF from Nimbus 7 (ERB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PMOD analysis involves an adjustment to correct for a glitch in the ERB data (orientation changes and/or switching off), but SW09 claims – without providing convincing arguments – that this correction cannot be justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACRIM composite does not account for a jump in the ‘ACRIM-gap’ due to instrumental changes. SW09 show a comparison between different analyses and Krivova et al. (2007) modeled TSI, but later acknowledge that the latter modeled TSI disagrees with measurements on decadal time scales. Furthermore, when the TSI is not adjusted over the ‘ACRIM-gap’, there is the apparent inconsistency between TSI and GCR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: My conclusion is that the LF08 paper is far more convincing than the SW09 in terms of whether the TSI data should be adjusted over the ‘ACRIM-gap’. But the this is probably not the final word on the matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241592233335"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3191">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e11d2ef12f3db01</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="religion"/><category term="American Family Association"/><category term="homophobia"/><category term="Gay marriage"/><category term="Carrie Prejean"/><category term="Miss California"/><category term="Miss USA"/><category term="Miley Cyrus"/><category term="OneMillionMoms"/><title type="html">Miss California to be stripped?

&lt;p&gt;First,&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12300858"&gt;Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may be stripped of her crown&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pageant officials Tuesday said they are looking into whether Prejean violated her contract by working with a national group opposed to gay marriage and by posing semi-nude when she was a 17-year-old model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pageant spokesman Roger Neal said Tuesday it appears Prejean has violated the 12-page contract all prospective contestants were required to sign before competing in the November state contest. The contract prohibits Miss California from making personal appearances, giving interviews or making commercials without permission from pageant officials. In the last 10 days, Prejean has made televised appearances at her San Diego church and on behalf of the National Organization for Marriage, a group opposed to same-sex marriage. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The contact also contains a clause asking participants to say whether they have conducted themselves “in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards.” As an example, it asks if they have ever been photographed nude or partially nude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photo of Prejean wearing only pink panties with her back turned to the camera appeared Monday on a gossip blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prejean on Tuesday fired back that she has done nothing wrong and that she suspects she’s being hounded for her anti-gay-marriage stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am a Christian, and I am a model. Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos.” She added, “On April 19, I chose to answer a question during the 2009 Miss USA pageant in an honest and personal manner that expressed my views of the long-established definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. Yet my comments defending traditional marriage have led to intimidation tactics that seek to undermine my reputation and somehow silence me and my beliefs, as if opinion is only a one-way street.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay, I actually have to agree with her that considering she’s a model and considering she had to even be in swimwear for the contest itself, I always find it extremely hypocritical of beauty pageants to suddenly object to modeling that is only slightly more risque, especially considering there’s absolutely nothing wrong with nudity or with the human body. Now I’ve also heard from some reports that there’s even a topless shot of her, but again, so what?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ya gotta love the classic Fundie persecution complex. Whether the rules are fair or not, she signed a contract fully knowing what was expected of her. She violated her contract. She KNOWS she violated her contract. And yet, it’s just the evil gay agenda inquisition that’s out to get her. Ugh! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:fsGBw1Mmxdlo_M:http://blog.beliefnet.com/moviemom/miley_cyrus3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:fsGBw1Mmxdlo_M:http://blog.beliefnet.com/moviemom/miley_cyrus3.jpg" alt="" width="93" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And then there’s this Miley Cyrus thing. I never thought I’d ever compliment Miley Cyrus but I’m proud that despite her seemingly squeaky clean, Christian-friendly image, she recognizes the absurdity of opposing marriage equality. Her position on this issue came out when she tweeted her support of Perez Hilton regarding Miss California discussed above. And now, &lt;a href="http://lezgetreal.com/?p=11947"&gt;the bigots are coming out of the woodwork to attack her&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OneMillionMoms.com, an anti-gay website brought to us by the American Family Association, has issued an action alert against tween sensation &lt;a title="Miley Cyrus" rel="homepage" href="http://www.mileycyrus.com/"&gt;Miley Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; because she sent out a Twitter message in support of marriage equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, their charge is the same as that of the Westboro Baptist Church, that she’s a “fag enabler.” Only for some reason, the WBC are viewed as evil fanatics because they picket funerals while these assholes are just seen as conservatives with a differing political view because they pick on little girls. Classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine if these douchebags would actually devote their time to helping to solve real problems in the world like war, feeding the hungry, Global Warming, or religion? What a waste! Miley, you get a gold star from me.&lt;/p&gt;

Now they’ve put out a press release that I’m resposting below in its entirety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congressional Briefing on Vaccines Addresses Local, National Disease Outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother of Hib Meningitis Victim Shares Story with Congress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(WASHINGTON, D.C.): Amidst recent disease outbreaks, Congressmen Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Joseph Barton (R-TX) held a Congressional briefing with several vaccine advocacy organizations to communicate disease risks and consequences. In light of recent resurgences of disease both locally and across the country, Every Child By Two (ECBT) and the American Medical Association (AMA) co-hosted the briefing to educate Congressional members and their staffers on the importance of timely immunization. Several public health organizations and medical associations joined ECBT and AMA as co-sponsors of this important briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, five children in Minnesota contracted the vaccine-preventable infection Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) resulting in the death of one. Reports indicate that several of the children were intentionally unvaccinated. However, one of the victims was fully vaccinated but suffered from an immune disorder, which prevented the vaccines from working. This child, Julieanna Metcalf, barely survived according to her mother Brendalee Flint, who spoke to Congressional members today. “My daughter endured multiple seizures, brain surgery and a month in the hospital because of this terrible disease,” she said. Julieanna remains developmentally delayed due to her illness. “Parents need to understand that when they choose not to vaccinate, they are making a decision for other people’s children as well. Somebody else chose Julieanna’s path. I still see the scar every day. Our family should not have had to endure this suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are now seeing the severe impact that vaccine-preventable diseases can have on our children,” said Amy Pisani, MS, executive director of Every Child By Two, “A man from the Washington, D.C. area brought the measles virus back with him after a recent trip to India. By the time the man realized he had the illness and sought medical attention, he had already visited seven places throughout the Washington region and infected an 8-month old child in a hospital waiting room. While this particular instance was not due to parental refusal to vaccinate, several other outbreaks have been attributed to misinformation about vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Mark Sawyer, who treated children during the San Diego measles outbreak of 2008, spoke about the importance of community immunity. “It’s false and reckless to assume that these diseases have disappeared. We have seen the return of Hib in Minnesota and elsewhere as well as the resurgence of measles both on the East and West Coasts. No community is immune to vaccine-preventable diseases. Parents need to be aware of the critical importance of vaccinating their children on time to protect them when they are most vulnerable,” said Dr. Sawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent cases of swine influenza highlight the importance of maintaining a robust public health infrastructure that can rapidly detect and contain disease outbreaks. In addition, as stressed by CDC Acting Director Richard Besser, MD, people need to be community-oriented. Preventing disease and containing outbreaks are everyone’s responsibility. For more information on swine influenza, visit the CDC’s website at www.cdc.gov/swineflu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Child By Two, the Rosalynn Carter/Betty Bumpers Campaign for Early Childhood Immunization, works to ensure that all children receive timely immunizations and continues to seek methods to institutionalize vaccine delivery and ensure access to vaccines for all children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/homeopathy_kills_a_child.php"&gt;Homeopathy strikes again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE parents of a nine-month-old girl who died from septicemia were responsible for their baby’s death because they shunned conventional medical treatment for her eczema in favour of homeopathic remedies, a court heard yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homeopath, Thomas Sam, 42, and his wife, Manju Sam, 36, are standing trial in the NSW Supreme Court charged with manslaughter by gross criminal negligence after they allegedly resisted the advice of nurses and a doctor to send her to a skin specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sad as it is, it’s not surprising. This is just another name to add to &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html"&gt;the list of people who have been either killed or harmed because of misplaced trust in homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;. I hope the homeopaths go away for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on a related note, one thing that has surprised  science bloggers everywhere today is that the Huffington Post (home of nonsense not even fit for the National Inquirer to print) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/whoa_could_it_be_an_actual_science-based.php"&gt;actually posted a science-based article about homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Chris Matthews for really playing hardball and not letting this guy just dodge the questions. I love how Pence wouldn’t answer the question of whether or not he believed the world was literally created in 7 days. Matthews really knocked this one out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;

And as disturbing as that story was, the military response has been to commit another outrage. &lt;a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/Security/Default.aspx?id=516980"&gt;They’re actually destroying the Bibles belonging to an American soldier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; quotes Maj. Jennifer Willis at the Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, who said “I can now confirm that the Bibles shown on Al Jazeera’s clip were, in fact, collected by the chaplains and later destroyed. They were never distributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the military officials, the Bibles were sent through private mail to an evangelical Christian soldier by his church back home. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says the soldier brought them to the Bible study class where they were filmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I fail to see how that is helpful. If anything, it’s just going to lead to a backlash of conservative media personalities like Bill O-Reilly using this as an example of liberals going too far, yada, yada, yada. And second of all, the Bibles didn’t do anything wrong; they’re inanimate objects. It’s the soldier who need to be punished. If there is no official policy, I think there should be:  The United States of America DOES NOT BURN BOOKS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href="http://inatheistbus.org/2009/05/05/bloomington-rejects-you-can-be-good-without-god-lawsuit-underway/"&gt;the Indiana bus company, Bloomington Transit, rejected the planned athvertising for their buses&lt;/a&gt;. They cited the “too controversial” clause. Of course there was absolutely nothing wrong with the ad. See for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/goodgod.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/goodgod.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="178"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is “too controversial?” But the Indiana Atheists are not giving up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the ACLU of Indiana, on behalf of the campaign, is filing a lawsuit against Bloomington Transit on First Amendment grounds. No campaign donations will be spent on the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://inatheistbus.org/wp-content/media/CMPLT.pdf"&gt;Here is the filed complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 172 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, Pat Robertson gives relationship advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/atheist-news-5509/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/7Zv9AgwKAE0/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, it seems that&lt;a href="http://www.marriageinbali.com/"&gt; in Indonesia, atheists are not even recognized&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All couples who marry in Indonesia must declare a&lt;strong&gt; religion.&lt;/strong&gt; Agnosticism and Atheism are not recognized. The Civil Registry Office can record marriages of persons of Islam, Hindu, Buddhist, Christian-Protestant and Christian-Catholic faiths. Marriage partners must have the same religion; otherwise one partner must make a written declaration of a change of religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. The wedding’s off. Cancel the caterers.&lt;/p&gt;

While I disagree in some senses, this is in many ways very true; The majority of the nation is composed of Christians, and despite laws against it, Christian morality works its ways into our politics, schools, and just about everything else. Those of us that aren't Christians, or are but are the wrong &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of Christians constantly have an uphill battle to make sure that our rights aren't trodden upon. It would be wonderful for atheists as a minority, if we got the theocrats out of power and had a secular government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So wouldn't it be strange for Christians to be the persecuted minority praying for a secular government?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, it's &lt;a href="http://www.persecution.org/suffering/newssummpopup.php?newscode=9989"&gt;happening in India&lt;/a&gt;. The plight there seems worse than minorities have in the US, but it's a good reminder of what happens to minorities under sectarian governments. So while Christians have it good here, they should keep in mind just what it would be like if that shoe was on the other foot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, experience has told me that those that most desperately need to keep this perspective are &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2006/10/30-days-atheistchristian-review.html"&gt;completely blind to it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-7830874329415504097?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241585361856"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1408">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8843869dba7bf62b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pragmatics"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">First American Dies of Swine Flu</title><published>2009-05-06T04:50:43Z</published><updated>2009-05-06T04:50:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1408" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's what I heard today on my local National Public Radio station:  "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first American has died of swine flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" And also, for clarification, "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first American has died of H1N1.&lt;/span&gt;" But who is or was the first American, I mused, heartlessly, while being an asshole in the defenseless Texan evening traffic. Obama? Benjamin Franklin? Some spear-wielding mastodon hunter? At any rate, not the unfortunate woman who just died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Several cyber-aeons ago (last week, in fact) Mark Liberman &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1384"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the "first" ambiguity. Horror of horrors, the sentence "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Who was the first president born in the twentieth century?&lt;/span&gt;" is ambiguous: first to become president, or first to be born. But the example I heard as I was driving home from work (and, btw, this post's title is the headline of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/health/06flu.html?hp"&gt;NYT variant&lt;/a&gt; of the NPR story) perfectly illustrates the fact that the problem with "first" is worse. Much, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the terms of Mark's post and the many ensuing comments seemed to hint that although there is an ambiguity, in principle there are just a few possible readings, two maybe, and that these alternatives are recoverable by scrutinizing the form of the sentence. Well, practically speaking there often are only one or two reasonable alternatives, and scrutinizing the sentence in question might well be enough to tell you what they are. But, looking at the sentence is not always enough, and n may be bigger than 2. A lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, "the first X" means "the example of an X that was first to achieve Y". In simple cases, Y is just reaching a state in which the description X is appropriate. Thus "the first president" can refer to Washington because it means: the example of a president who was first to achieve a state in which "president" was an accurate description. (That's a long way of saying something very simple, but bear with me!) Mark's reader's example complicated things a little, because X  was a complex expression - "president born in the twentieth century". So now you get an ambiguity, you can choose Y to be becoming president, or being born, although for many people one reading is much more salient than the other. The thing is, however, that there need not be anything in the X noun phrase which says what Y is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my radio example, Y is not taken from the X noun phrase at all, but from a following verb phrase which is clearly not part of the same noun phrase as "first". The verb phrase is "has died of swine flu". And the pattern of choosing Y from a following verb phrase is not uncommon. In fact, I heard the linguist Jeff Pelletier talk about a variant some years ago as a potential counterexample to the principle linguists and philosophers of language term &lt;em&gt;compositionality &lt;/em&gt;(the principle that the meaning of complex expressions is completely predictable from the meanings of the parts and the way they're put together). His example was "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first man walked on the moon in 1969&lt;/span&gt;", which doesn't refer to Adam. It's easy to find more examples where Y is not drawn from X but from a following verb phrase. Here's another one with X=American:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;he first American&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; was&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; killed by robots, there were 13000 robots in in industrial use in the United States.&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/risks/2.19.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things really are worse still. The Y achievement need not even come from the same sentential clause as the "first". So it is that for all of the following examples, you have no way of being sure what "the first American" was first at without taking a look at the linked documents to see what was on the writer's mind (although you might like to see if you can guess 5 out of 5):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first American was Joe Organ, in seventh place, and…&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00714FB3455157A93C1AB1783D85F448285F9"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first American was Wilhelm Heinrich Keating from Philadelphia who came to Freiberg in 1819.&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.geophysik.tu-freiberg.de/3dem4/venue/the_university.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that &lt;em&gt;ambiguity&lt;/em&gt; of a sentence is taken to imply a choice between a certain fixed set of readings, sentences with "the first" in them are not simply ambiguous. For the range of possible interpretations is potentially infinite, depending on what achievements Y happen to be particularly salient in the context of writing or utterance. "The first X" is not so much ambiguous as completely and utterly underspecified as regards what the X in question is first at. A fine distinction you might say, but I think it's worth separating n=2 from n→∞. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All indications are pointing towards a worsening trend as more and more children ages 2 years and up with subprime loans are simply unable to make payments on their Classic Castles, Country Cottages, and Endless Adventures Patio Playhouses,” Timmy Duncan, senior analyst for the Federal National Mortgage Association’s Toddler Division, explained. “Their Piggy Banks are emptying fast and it is no wonder that many are turning to afternoons of crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As growing numbers of these houses are going into foreclosure, suburban police forces are adapting to the resulting increases in toddler crime. Many are installing child car seats within patrol car suspect transport enclosures and Fisher Price Corn Poppers are fast becoming standard-issue equipment. A race to develop profitable non-lethal methods of incapacitation and containment are being developed by both Lego and Play-Doh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SciencePunk challenge: give me two unrelated topics and I will attempt to write a blog post combining them. Your time starts now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of several excellent and perplexing replies, I decided to seize the gauntlet thrown down by Martin of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.layscience.net/"&gt;The Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt; blog:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;@SciencePunk Pigs, and the flu. No? Oh alright... erm... Mars and cheese.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here it is Martin!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;* * *&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you heard the words "time reversal technology" you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a plot point from the new Star Trek movie. Yet across the world, physicists and engineers are using it to explore the world around them, from astronomy to cheese-making. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whenever waves pass through a medium, they respond to changes in the properties of that material. Sound waves passing through the ocean, for example, are warped and garbled by differences in the density of the water, making acoustic communication with submarines troublesome. Similarly, astronomers are vexed by atmospheric blurring, where the turbulent gasses that cocoon our planet can distort an otherwise &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/06-world.s-hardest-working-telescope"&gt;BAT-worthy&lt;/a&gt; image of Mars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, help is at hand. Time reversal technology replays the signal in reverse, and subtracts this from the original. Because the distortions cancel out one another, the result is a much cleaner image or sound. You can read an incredibly complex article about it &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.math.ucdavis.edu%2F~fannjiang%2Fhome%2Fpub%2Ftire-siam-proof.pdf&amp;amp;ei=WGgASonpNMSgjAeD84CDBw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG8X-ncQdg8kYrHUnv8GLFZyA3FCQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what does this have to do with cheese? Later this month, a group of French and Uruguayan scientists will attend a conference in Portland, Oregon, to discuss their work using the same technology to probe "soft solids". Directing acoustic waves through a material, they are using time reversal to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://asa.aip.org/web2/asa/abstracts/search.may09/asa135.html"&gt;analyse the distortions and draw conclusions about the properties of that object&lt;/a&gt;. This low-cost technology has various applications in the food industry, e.g. allowing cheese makers to test the ripeness of their Brie stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that is how you combine Mars and cheese in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/05/time_reversal_technology_probe_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~4/JQgszEWAPXk" height="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241568162676"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/twitter_and_the_news_video.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f4cbd3401cf061f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Twitter and the News (video)</title><published>2009-05-05T23:50:49Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T23:50:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/8H3jMpIRH6I/twitter_and_the_news_video.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/twitter_and_the_news_video.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="width:0px;height:0px" border="0" width="0" height="0" src="http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyNDE1NjAzNjk1NTMmcHQ9MTI*MTU2MzgwNjU2NSZwPTI2Njc1MSZkPXR2b1ZpZGVvUGFnZSZnPTImdD*mbz*xMmU4ODkyZjdiMTg*YmE*OTY2ZGNkYjRlN2Y1ODg4YyZvZj*w.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good conversation for those interested in Twitter and the current journalistic revolution, calm-headed and smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Paikin, who did the interview, was sometimes a little hazy about what journalism is, mixing up breaking news with news analysis with investigative journalism - I wish he has read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" title=""&gt;my little classification effort&lt;/a&gt; - but the others corrected him politely.

&lt;p&gt;This is of interest to me, as motor planning is something I struggle with myself, and it is also reported by others on the spectrum.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia"&gt;Apraxia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspraxia"&gt;dyspraxia&lt;/a&gt; co-diagnoses are common enough that both myself and the other speaker on AAC yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.joannecafiero.com/"&gt;Joanne Cafiero&lt;/a&gt;, made specific mention of motor planning as relates to difficulties with speech (for the record, I have a speech apraxia Dx).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_EarlyOral-Manual.pdf"&gt;Infant and toddler oral- and manual-motor skills predict later speech fluency in autism (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; found a significant correlation between early oral and manual motor skills and later speech fluency.  This study also suggests a link between motor skills and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not all people on the spectrum report differences in motor functioning, and not all people on the spectrum have difficulty producing speech.  However, a fair amount of us do and I'm pleased to see more research being done in this area.  I'm reminded of a quote from Lucy Blackman which I relate to very much (see &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucys-Story-Autism-Other-Adventures/dp/1843100428/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1241563254&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Lucy's Story&lt;/a&gt;), "Being unable to say something, actually is the same as not being able to move in response to an instruction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 34:00, he started telling some fun entomology stories–one of which ended with a statement that most mass-produced, pre-ground coffee, as well as chocolate, has roach parts in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most entomologists or folks working in agriculture, this is not much of a shock. I have &lt;a title="Cochineal: it&amp;#39;s a bug and a feature!" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/cochineal-its-a-bug-and-a-feature/"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; before how the &lt;a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/dalbook.html#CHPTA"&gt;FDA allows a wide variety of insect parts&lt;/a&gt; in most food products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, though, including interviewer &lt;a title="That part of the interview was hilarious, actually" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100593"&gt;Terri Gross&lt;/a&gt;, this clearly this was another case of OMGWTFBUGZINMAIFOODZ!  For those that aren’t afraid to know, here is the &lt;a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/dalbook.html#CHPTA"&gt;allowable amount of insects in chocolate and coffee beans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="0" cellpadding="5"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="30%"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="30%"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHOCOLATE AND CHOCOLATE LIQUOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="20%"&gt;Insect filth&lt;br&gt;
(AOAC 965.38)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;Average is 60 or more insect fragments per 100 grams when 6 100-gram subsamples are examined&lt;br&gt;
OR&lt;br&gt;
Any 1 subsample contains 90 or more insect fragments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="30%"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COFFEE BEANS, GREEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td valign="top" width="20%"&gt;Insect Filth and Insects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;Average 10% or more by count are insect-infested or insect-damagedDEFECT SOURCE: &lt;em&gt; Insect fragments – post harvest and/or processing insect infestation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;action level&lt;/strong&gt; means that if there are MORE than 60 insect fragments in 0.2 lbs of chocolate (100 grams, more or less), or MORE than 10% of the beans are damaged or infested, the food is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these have the same FDA marking: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIGNIFICANCE:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; Aesthetic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will not harm you to eat these insect parts. It simply Freaks. People. Out.&lt;br&gt;
So FDA controls contamination below a noticeable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans like processed foods. However, there is a price for having someone else process stuff in bulk–some things will fall in that you might not want to know about.  (You SOOO do not ever want to go to a pickle factory. Trust me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also like our food PERFECT–which means that producers have to use chemicals to make fruit perfectly shaped and unblemished, as well as using lots of preservatives to keep things lasting in their packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as we have become more and more disconnected from nature, we become more convinced that the world should (and can be) made sterile and safe. That is utter bullshite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature is dirty. Life is dirty. Poop, rats, and insects happen, despite everyone’s best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we demand perfection, we create an unobtainable standard that results in tons of food wastage every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are convenience, perfection, and sterility &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the most important things to think about when choosing foods? What about how it was grown, or how many resources are used to package and ship it?  What about the welfare of the people who produced and manufactured it?  In the case of &lt;a title="Coffee and Conservation" href="http://www.coffeehabitat.com/category/coffee-and-the-environment/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070319175847.htm"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, these are not &lt;a title="did child slaves make your chocolate?" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1272522.stm"&gt;insignificant&lt;/a&gt; issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, most of us actually have lots of choices about our food consumption–which of these might you choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop eating food that is pre-prepared and pre-packaged. That way you’ll know exactly what goes into your food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to accept some damage to food (a blemish on your apple, bread without preservatives that goes moldy in a week) so that fewer chemicals are used in search of perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can, join a community garden and learn how hard it is to grow food.  Discover that fruit with a little insect nibble on it still tastes pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept that insects will occasionally get into food, and that the convenience of having packaged food outweighs the knowledge that something with lots of legs might be in it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to die anytime soon. But it could happen this moment, while I am writing. I was talking the other day with Jim Toback, a friend of 35 years, and the conversation turned to our deaths, as it always does. "Ask someone how they feel about death," he said, "and they'll tell you everyone's gonna die. Ask them, In the next 30 seconds? No, no, no, that's not gonna happen. How about this afternoon? No. What you're really asking them to admit is, Oh my God, I don't really exist and I might be gone at any given second."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Me too, but I hope not. I have plans. Still, this blog has led me resolutely toward the contemplation of death. In the beginning I found myself drawn toward writing about my life. Everyone's life story is awaiting only the final page. Then I began writing on the subject of evolution, that most consoling of all the sciences, and was engulfed in an unforeseen discussion about God, the afterlife, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that bit about the consolation of evolution — I feel it too, that having a connection to both our long history and our future is really the province of evolution, and that this is where we can find deeper meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought of dying any time is real, too. In my case, it's the awareness that I'm only about 4 years away from having outlived my father (although he also suffered over a dozen long years of heart disease, a history I've avoided so far). We could any of us go at any time, and as godless folk, our only relief from melancholy has to be in the taking of joy in reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/roger_ebert_humanist.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6JMTk-BtwWI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241559521778"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/whoa_could_it_be_an_actual_science-based.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9dae30b5121effc8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Whoa.

I must be dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that because I actually see an article in &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; in which the blogger, Jacob Dickerman, actually &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;correctly describes why homeopathy is quackery&lt;/a&gt;! For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Homeopaths will tell us that water has a memory. That it vibrates in a certain way and thus knows exactly what the homeopath put into it. The thing is, if Hahnemann is somehow right about homeopathy, then it doesn't only fly in the face of all those sciences I listed above (physiology, physics, chemistry, germ theory, hydro-dynamics), it flies in the face of public safety. Because the Florine in our water will have less of an effect than the 65-million year old dinosaur feces that have been naturally distilled for millennia. They say that it has no side effects, and they're right. What they don't say is that it doesn't have any primary effects either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still can't believe I'm reading HuffPo after my prolonged screed yesterday about all the psuedo science that's appeared in Arianna Huffington's little project since its inception in 2005. Best to head on over there before &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_woo_on--where_else--the_huffington.php"&gt;Patricia Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, the homeopath who's the new "Wellness Editor" at HuffPo finds out and tries to dilute it into nonexistence, like a homeopathic remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, any attempt to suppress it would only make it stronger. Many have discovered this law of the Internet--to their sorrow. It's also a law homeopaths should understand. After all, they believe that diluting a remedy can make it stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/whoa_could_it_be_an_actual_science-based.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/hlhrj-L5ZEQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241559102320"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=478">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59a3d3d8d43a844c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">When what to my wondering eyes should appear….</title><published>2009-05-05T21:00:29Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T21:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=478" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;…but an actual pro-science post at The Huffington Post in which the blogger, Jacob Dickerman, actually &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;correctly describes why homeopathy is quackery&lt;/a&gt;!

On January 19, 2007, then 16-year-old &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/too-much-tragedy-student-charged-in-fatal-stabbing-of-classmate-2/"&gt;John Odgren&lt;/a&gt; stabbed and killed a 15-year-old classmate, James Alenson, at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in Massachusetts. Odgren's diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome was noted and &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/state-report-provides-details-of-odgren/"&gt;the extent to which he understood&lt;/a&gt; the "effects of his behavior on others" debated.  As reported in the May 3rd &lt;a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2009_05_03_Mass__high_court_to_consider_recorded_jail_calls/"&gt;Boston Herald&lt;/a&gt;, defense lawyers for Odgren say that he was "insane" when he killed Alenson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prosecutors say that taped telephone conversations between Odgren, who is now 18, and his family in the months following his arrest "show a lucid boy who was not in the throes of mental illness." A judge has blocked the use of the tapes from being used at Odgren's trial; it's argued that proper procedure was violated when prosecutors obtained the tapes without the permission of the court. From the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2009_05_03_Mass__high_court_to_consider_recorded_jail_calls/"&gt;Boston Herald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors argue Odgren had no "expectation of privacy" because he was well aware of the policy on recording conversations, which is stated in a prerecorded message at the beginning of each call. Odgren also signed a document that informed him that all phone calls and conversations were recorded and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recordings sought by prosecutors include both conversations he had on the phone and conversations he had with people who came to see him at the jail, where visitors are separated from inmates by a glass partition and both must speak into a phone to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of another young man now in prison, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/really_not_prepared_more_on_criminal_justice_autism"&gt;Chris Bello&lt;/a&gt;. Bello has been accused of as many as 100 instances of molestation of a 5-year-old child, as reported in the April 13th &lt;a href="http://www.disaboom.com/Blogs/disabled_politico/archive/2009/04/13/aunt-of-autistic-teen-charged-with-rape-and-sodomy-says-her-nephew-is-an-quot-innocent-victim-of-a-witch-hunt-quot.aspx"&gt;Disaboom&lt;/a&gt;---but, as his mother, Judith Bello, points out, how much did he understand about his rights when he made statements to the police and throughout the judicial process? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much did Odgren understand about the documents he was signing regarding his phone calls and conversations being "recorded and monitored"?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241557428341"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-937483461490853053">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4296c248462bda70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #120: Winners</title><published>2009-05-05T20:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T20:46:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/mondays-molecule-120-winners.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/937483461490853053/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=937483461490853053" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> UPDATE: The image depicts the genome of a human papillomavirus.

&lt;p&gt;The outrage was triggered by an article that appeared yesterday ahead of &lt;a&gt;Dr. Alice Roberts&lt;/a&gt;' brilliant-looking new program ("The Incredible Human Journey", BBC2) about the &lt;a&gt;evolution of the human race&lt;/a&gt;, starting this weekend. &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1177123/The-European-Created-fragments-fossil-face-forbears-35-000-years-ago.html"&gt;The Daily Mail article featured a reconstruction of the face of one of our first European ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, triggering an outpouring of grief and anguish among the more xenophobic readers of the downmarket, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Inter-war_period"&gt;formerly-Nazi-supporting&lt;/a&gt;, BBC-Hating, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN#Ownership"&gt;ITN-shares-owning&lt;/a&gt;, misogynist, factually-inaccurate tabloid rag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of intelligent, analytical journalism, let's point and laugh at the stupid people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Snouck", from Amsterdam draws on his vast experience of anthropology and forensic science to highlight the Orwellian plot that must surely lie behind this shocking piece of propaganda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that this result was not modelled on actual human remains. But rather on the image the Ministry of Truth has on what a modern European OUGHT to look like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay from London disagrees, believing the plot to originate within the BBC itself. Apparently unaware that the skin colour is the most likely match for people in the area who have recently left African, she wails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typical of the BBC's obsession with political correctness. Archaeology would NOT indicate skin colour anyway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian from Exeter isn't having any of it, because Europeans couldn't possibly come from Africans. I mean, if that was true, then Aryans couldn't ever be &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; pure, and that's just not acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rubbish. Europeans did not come from Africans and never could. This is just more anti-European propaganda, of as much real scientific merit as Piltdown Man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to know more about this "anti-European propaganda." Who exactly are responsible for this? Is this some sort of secret African plot? The Asians perhaps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David from North Wales feels that the colour is probably accurate, but has some scientific disagreements with the dating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all descended from Adam and Eve, who were most probably had brown skin and were from the middle east no more than 10,000 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Paul from Gloucester is annoyed that his fringe theories aren't given credit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Darwinism does NOT work and yet everyone peddles this rubbish as fact! 'Intelligent design' comes FAR closer to explaining the mystery of life!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the fact that Paul is perhaps the best example of evolution not - sorry, NOT - working, it's worth pointing out that Intelligent Design explains precisely nothing about the mystery of life. Where did the designer come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such philosophical problems don't deter Maureen from Fleetwood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no such thing as evolution. Finches might develop different beaks depending on the type of food they eat in their particular area but they will NEVER, in a million years, evolve into anything other than finches. And interbreeding pigeons might produce a vast array of different birds BUT they remain pigeons. No amount of interbreeding will evolve them into anything other than pigeons. Why do people believe such nonsense?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen evidently hasn't heard of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; (and see David Quammen's awesome book "&lt;a&gt;Song of the Dodo&lt;/a&gt;" for more on Dodos and island biogeography), nor apparently the concept of scientific evidence, which is the two word answer to her closing question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the prize for the most ignorant and blatantly racist quote so far goes to Paul from Exeter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Modern european man did not come from something like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which frankly left me speechless. Firstly that anyone so bigoted still exists in this country, and secondly that the Daily Mail were happy to let a comment like this through moderation. Still, god-forbid the Mail should censor their own target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ecbt.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/ecbt_logo.jpg" alt="Every Child By Two"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I recently received this press release from the wonderful organization called &lt;a href="http://www.ecbt.org"&gt;Every Child By Two&lt;/a&gt;, a national non-profit set up to make sure children get their vaccinations. As you might expect, they are concerned about the recent rise of the antivax mob, who seemed determined to misinform parents and ensure we have a whole generation of kids susceptible to easily preventable potentially fatal infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release is important, and I reproduce it below in full. If you are so inclined, please show ECBT your love. Spread the word. Kids are dying, all over the world, and it’s incredibly easy to prevent it. All we need to do is make sure parents get real information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congressional Briefing on Vaccines Addresses Local, National Disease Outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother of Hib Meningitis Victim Shares Story with Congress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(WASHINGTON, D.C.):  Amidst recent disease outbreaks, Congressmen Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Joseph Barton (R-TX) held a Congressional briefing with several vaccine advocacy organizations to communicate disease risks and consequences.  In light of recent resurgences of disease both locally and across the country, Every Child By Two (ECBT) and the American Medical Association (AMA) co-hosted the briefing to educate Congressional members and their staffers on the importance of timely immunization.  Several public health organizations and medical associations joined ECBT and AMA as co-sponsors of this important briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, five children in Minnesota contracted the vaccine-preventable infection Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) resulting in the death of one.  Reports indicate that several of the children were intentionally unvaccinated.  However, one of the victims was fully vaccinated but suffered from an immune disorder, which prevented the vaccines from working.  This child, Julieanna Metcalf, barely survived according to her mother Brendalee Flint, who spoke to Congressional members today. &amp;quot;My daughter endured multiple seizures, brain surgery and a month in the hospital because of this terrible disease,&amp;quot; she said.  Julieanna remains developmentally delayed due to her illness.  &amp;quot;Parents need to understand that when they choose not to vaccinate, they are making a decision for other people’s children as well.  Somebody else chose Julieanna’s path.  I still see the scar every day. Our family should not have had to endure this suffering.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are now seeing the severe impact that vaccine-preventable diseases can have on our children,&amp;quot; said Amy Pisani, MS, executive director of Every Child By Two, &amp;quot;A man from the Washington, D.C. area brought the measles virus back with him after a recent trip to India.  By the time the man realized he had the illness and sought medical attention, he had already visited seven places throughout the Washington region and infected an 8-month old child in a hospital waiting room. While this particular instance was not due to parental refusal to vaccinate, several other outbreaks have been attributed to misinformation about vaccines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Mark Sawyer, who treated children during the San Diego measles outbreak of 2008, spoke about the importance of community immunity.  &amp;quot;It’s false and reckless to assume that these diseases have disappeared.  We have seen the return of Hib in Minnesota and elsewhere as well as the resurgence of measles both on the East and West Coasts.  No community is immune to vaccine-preventable diseases.  Parents need to be aware of the critical importance of vaccinating their children on time to protect them when they are most vulnerable,&amp;quot; said Dr. Sawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent cases of swine influenza highlight the importance of maintaining a robust public health infrastructure that can rapidly detect and contain disease outbreaks.  In addition, as stressed by CDC Acting Director Richard Besser, MD, people need to be community-oriented.  Preventing disease and containing outbreaks are everyone’s responsibility.  For more information on swine influenza, visit the CDC’s website at www.cdc.gov/swineflu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Child By Two, the Rosalynn Carter/Betty Bumpers Campaign for Early Childhood Immunization, works to ensure that all children receive timely immunizations and continues to seek methods to institutionalize vaccine delivery and ensure access to vaccines for all children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It interests me to consider the ways that we might fight back against quackery, and whether or not it’s always &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Huffington Post has exploded like an industrial factory that only produces gasoline and craziness. That’s right: an exploding crazy factory.

Read a more thorough overview on the topic at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=473"&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, but just know that the Huffington Post used to be a popular lefty political blog with minor amounts of crazy, but has now reached full-blown crazy factory status. Speaking as a lefty who prefers not to see politics mix with crazy, this sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with some amount of relief (and yet a new kind of concern) that I see &lt;em&gt;we have a man on the inside&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;Meet Jacob Dickerman&lt;/a&gt;, HuffPo blogger and actual skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob has written a fine article addressing those bloodsuckers who are selling homeopathy to cure swine flu (which &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7074"&gt;I posted about here&lt;/a&gt; last week), and remarkably that article is, at this moment, still available to the public. I’m a bit concerned, you see, since I learned from the afore-linked Science Based Medicine post that the HuffPo’s “Wellness Editor” is an actual homeopath. Awkward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just the Wellness Editor who is anti-reality — Ariana Huffington herself is apparently quite the quacky one. An SGU listener recently wrote in with an interesting back story on the Huff, saying (in part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years Ms. Huffington has been affiliated with a New Age spiritual group in Los Angeles called the &lt;a href="http://www.msia.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, MSIA&lt;/a&gt;.  This church is a personality cult centered around a man named John-Roger, who claims to carry the mantle of the Mystical Traveler Consciousness.  It is very similar to Eckanakar and many other late 20th century New Age groups.  Many of J-R’s followers subscribe to usual litany of psuedo-scientific crap, including, but not limited to, chakras, auras, homeopathy and holistic medicine (including an inherent mistrust in Western medicine and vaccinations), feng shui, positive thinking, etc.  Indeed, because J-R refuses to ingest pork, onions or garlic himself, many of his followers do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffington denied and downplayed allegations that she was linked to the maybe-cult during her husband’s Senatorial campaign, but she sure looks awful chummy with J-R in pics, and this &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5064930/ariannas-mandatory-cult-meetings"&gt;Gawker article&lt;/a&gt; describes how former HuffPo staffers claim she ordered them to go to MSIA meetings. Suspicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of her exact ties to that particular organization, she has made it clear that she has an irrational view of the world as evidenced by blog entries &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/on-becoming-spiritually-f_b_73672.html"&gt;such as this&lt;/a&gt;, found &lt;a href="http://hardcoremathuser.blogspot.com/2007/11/arianna-huffington-mystic.html"&gt;via this blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical and the rational [are] in a supposedly eternal and inexorable battle against the unseen and the spiritual. In fact, the barriers between these two dimensions — built by the narrow rationalism of the Enlightenment — are now being dismantled by modern science and a growing chorus of personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the big boss coming from a place like that, our chances of improving the Huffington Post with rationalism are slim. But hey, they make their money off your clicks, so we may want to encourage more skeptical posts like Jacob’s. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;Click the link&lt;/a&gt;, read the article, and maybe leave a comment letting Jacob and the HuffPo editors know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241551264254"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/fake_journals_versus_bad_journ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0182c88e427b5f5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Fake journals versus bad journals.</title><published>2009-05-05T18:53:52Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T18:53:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/IzlIuHEqerI/fake_journals_versus_bad_journ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/fake_journals_versus_bad_journ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By email, following on the heels of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/fake_medical_journals.php"&gt;my post about the Merck-commissioned, Elsevier-published fake journal &lt;i&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a reader asked whether the &lt;a href="http://www.jpands.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;JPandS&lt;/i&gt;) also counts as a fake journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate reaction was that &amp;quot;Wait, what?&amp;quot; is an idiom characteristic of American youth — 20-somethings and teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this may well be an instance of the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002948.html"&gt;frequency and recency illusions&lt;/a&gt;. After all, the meaning of &amp;quot;wait, what?&amp;quot; — its allegedly youthful connotation aside –  is entirely compositional. If anything has really changed, it can only how often this option is chosen as a way to express confused surprise. I&amp;#39;m sure that I&amp;#39;ve heard and said &amp;quot;wait, what?&amp;quot; many times in my life, and it won&amp;#39;t surprise me to find examples going back to Old English instances of &amp;quot;gebide, hwæt ?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I  think that something has changed, even if the only evidence that I have to offer is the fact that according to the comics search engine at ohnorobot.com, Randall Munroe's &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.com"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; has five examples (out of 578 strips in his oeuvre, though not all may be indexed yet) that use "wait, what?" Does this mean anything? Not really, though I'll assert (without proof) that the frequency of this locution would be significantly lower in Pogo or Charlie Brown, or for that matter Doonesbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, FWIW, here are the five strips (click on the images for larger versions):&lt;/p&gt;

I've read a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/eagleton_vs_dawkins.php"&gt;smattering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/a_little_more_on_eagleton.php"&gt;Eagleton&lt;/a&gt; before, and the words "brisk, funny and challenging" or "witty" never came to mind, and the review actually gave no evidence that these adjectives were applicable in this case. I felt like ripping into O'Hehir, but was held up by one awkward lack: I hadn't read Eagleton's book. Who knows? Maybe he had found some grain of sense and some literary imperative to write cleanly and plainly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was in New York the other day, and was offered a copy of Eagleton&amp;#39;s book, and took the first step in my imminent doom by accepting it. Then I tried to fly home on Saturday, one of those flights that was plagued with mechanical errors that caused delays and long stretches locked in a tin can, and also flights that were packed tightly with travelers…so crammed with people that they actually took my computer and book bag away from me to pack in the cargo hold, and I had to quickly snatch something to read before the baggage handlers took it away. I grabbed the Eagleton book. Thus was my fate sealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trapped in a plane for 8 hours with nothing to read but Eagleton and the Sky Mall catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

(SPOILER!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It interests me to consider the ways that we might fight back against quackery, and whether or not it’s always &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Huffington Post has exploded like an industrial factory that only produces gasoline and craziness. That’s right: an exploding crazy factory. There have been high-profile posts on anti-vaccination nonsense from &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/spring-cleaning-10-steps_b_177154.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;homeopathy idiocy&lt;/a&gt;, and holy crap &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay/the-science-of-distant-he_b_177986.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;someone who actually believes in distant healing&lt;/a&gt;. Read a more thorough overview on the topic at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=473"&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, but just know that the Huffington Post used to be a popular lefty political blog with minor amounts of crazy, but has now reached full-blown crazy factory status. Speaking as a lefty who prefers not to see politics mix with crazy, this sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with some amount of relief (and yet a new kind of concern) that I see &lt;em&gt;we have a man on the inside&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;Meet Jacob Dickerman&lt;/a&gt;, HuffPo blogger and actual skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob has written a fine article addressing those bloodsuckers who are selling homeopathy to cure swine flu (which &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7074"&gt;I posted about here&lt;/a&gt; last week), and remarkably that article is, at this moment, still available to the public. I’m a bit concerned, you see, since I learned from the afore-linked Science Based Medicine post that the HuffPo’s “Wellness Editor” is an actual homeopath. Awkward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just the Wellness Editor who is anti-reality — Ariana Huffington herself is apparently quite the quacky one. An SGU listener recently wrote in with an interesting back story on the Huff, saying (in part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years Ms. Huffington has been affiliated with a New Age spiritual group in Los Angeles called the &lt;a href="http://www.msia.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, MSIA&lt;/a&gt;.  This church is a personality cult centered around a man named John-Roger, who claims to carry the mantle of the Mystical Traveler Consciousness.  It is very similar to Eckanakar and many other late 20th century New Age groups.  Many of J-R’s followers subscribe to usual litany of psuedo-scientific crap, including, but not limited to, chakras, auras, homeopathy and holistic medicine (including an inherent mistrust in Western medicine and vaccinations), feng shui, positive thinking, etc.  Indeed, because J-R refuses to ingest pork, onions or garlic himself, many of his followers do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffington denied and downplayed allegations that she was linked to the maybe-cult during her husband’s Senatorial campaign, but she sure looks awful chummy with J-R in pics, and this &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5064930/ariannas-mandatory-cult-meetings"&gt;Gawker article&lt;/a&gt; describes how former HuffPo staffers claim she ordered them to go to MSIA meetings. Suspicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of her exact ties to that particular organization, she has made it clear that she has an irrational view of the world as evidenced by blog entries &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/on-becoming-spiritually-f_b_73672.html"&gt;such as this&lt;/a&gt;, found &lt;a href="http://hardcoremathuser.blogspot.com/2007/11/arianna-huffington-mystic.html"&gt;via this blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical and the rational [are] in a supposedly eternal and inexorable battle against the unseen and the spiritual. In fact, the barriers between these two dimensions — built by the narrow rationalism of the Enlightenment — are now being dismantled by modern science and a growing chorus of personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the big boss coming from a place like that, our chances of improving the Huffington Post with rationalism are slim. But hey, they make their money off your clicks, so we may want to encourage more skeptical posts like Jacob’s. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/swines-and-birds-and-home_b_195597.html"&gt;Click the link&lt;/a&gt;, read the article, and maybe leave a comment letting Jacob and the HuffPo editors know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241546278129"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/a_very_hungry_cephalopod.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b370c7a475efe386</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Fun"/><title type="html">A Very Hungry Cephalopod!</title><published>2009-05-05T16:14:21Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T16:14:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/cWKa0ZnE8IE/a_very_hungry_cephalopod.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/a_very_hungry_cephalopod.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/05/mmm_uintatherium.php" title=""&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; made me &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/05/whack-a-syndyoceras.php" title=""&gt;do this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the day metal detecting for Thomas Englund at the battlefield of Baggensstäket, anno 1719 (as blogged about before: &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/05/battle-of-baggensstket.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/04/battle_of_baggensstket_1.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/09/screaming_lead_hailstorm.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/09/boyscout_archaeology.php"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). This was my third time there, and the first time I've helped on the northern half of the area across the water from where I live. Thomas found musket and pistol balls. I picked up an 18th century coat button and loads of &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/04/death-to-makers-of-aluminium-bottle.html"&gt;steenkeenggg aluminium bottle tops&lt;/a&gt;, and saw an abandoned tree house.

&lt;p&gt;The outrage was triggered by an article that appeared yesterday ahead of &lt;a&gt;Dr. Alice Roberts&lt;/a&gt;' brilliant-looking new program ("The Incredible Human Journey", BBC2) about the &lt;a&gt;evolution of the human race&lt;/a&gt;, starting this weekend. &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1177123/The-European-Created-fragments-fossil-face-forbears-35-000-years-ago.html"&gt;The Daily Mail article featured a reconstruction of the face of one of our first European ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, triggering an outpouring of grief and anguish among the more xenophobic readers of the downmarket, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Inter-war_period"&gt;formerly-Nazi-supporting&lt;/a&gt;, BBC-Hating, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN#Ownership"&gt;ITN-shares-owning&lt;/a&gt;, misogynist, factually-inaccurate tabloid rag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that this result was not modelled on actual human remains. But rather on the image the Ministry of Truth has on what a modern European OUGHT to look like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay from London disagrees, believing the plot to originate within the BBC itself. Apparently unaware that the skin colour is the most likely match for people in the area who have recently left African, she wails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typical of the BBC's obsession with political correctness. Archaeology would NOT indicate skin colour anyway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian from Exeter isn't having any of it, because Europeans couldn't possibly come from Africans. I mean, if that was true, then Aryans couldn't ever be &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; pure, and that's just not acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rubbish. Europeans did not come from Africans and never could. This is just more anti-European propaganda, of as much real scientific merit as Piltdown Man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to know more about this "anti-European propaganda." Who exactly are responsible for this? Is this some sort of secret African plot? The Asians perhaps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David from North Wales feels that the colour is probably accurate, but has some scientific disagreements with the dating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all descended from Adam and Eve, who were most probably had brown skin and were from the middle east no more than 10,000 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Paul from Gloucester is annoyed that his fringe theories aren't given credit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Darwinism does NOT work and yet everyone peddles this rubbish as fact! 'Intelligent design' comes FAR closer to explaining the mystery of life!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the fact that Paul is perhaps the best example of evolution not - sorry, NOT - working, it's worth pointing out that Intelligent Design explains precisely nothing about the mystery of life. Where did the designer come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such philosophical problems don't deter Maureen from Fleetwood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no such thing as evolution. Finches might develop different beaks depending on the type of food they eat in their particular area but they will NEVER, in a million years, evolve into anything other than finches. And interbreeding pigeons might produce a vast array of different birds BUT they remain pigeons. No amount of interbreeding will evolve them into anything other than pigeons. Why do people believe such nonsense?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen evidently hasn't heard of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; (and see David Quammen's awesome book "&lt;a&gt;Song of the Dodo&lt;/a&gt;" for more on Dodos and island biogeography), nor apparently the concept of scientific evidence, which is the two word answer to her closing question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the prize for the most ignorant and blatantly racist quote so far goes to Paul from Exeter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Modern european man did not come from something like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which frankly left me speechless. Firstly that anyone so bigoted still exists in this country, and secondly that the Daily Mail were happy to let a comment like this through moderation. Still, god-forbid the Mail should censor their own target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

However, whether facts are truly as cool as the article makes them sound or not, the idea itself of having autistic teens &lt;a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/148725"&gt;design their own community center&lt;/a&gt; is quite grand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980's the elementary school in my home town had a project to build a new playground, and the students themselves drew up the plans.  Then the playground was developed to kid-spec.  It was undoubtedly the coolest playground I have ever seen (and woefully I was in high school by then!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistive technology designed by the people who use it has historically been wildly successful such as the &lt;a href="http://www.marilynhamilton.com/Introduction_Envision.html"&gt;Quickie wheelchair&lt;/a&gt;, designed by a woman who was frustrated by the at-the-time 60+ pound monstrosities, and the  popular &lt;a href="http://www.toby-churchill.com/"&gt;Lightwriter text to speech device&lt;/a&gt;, developed by a man who lost speech at age 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, end users for any space, place, or product know what they want and what they need--what works, what doesn't work, what needs improving.  Because the end user is ultimately who lives with that space, place, or technology on an ongoing, day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, yes, experts are needed to realize the mechanics of things--certainly not everyone knows how to put up walls, slides, axels, or circuit boards!--those experts need to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the end user directly as part of the process.  There needs to be an understanding that in their own way the end user is also an expert.  Just as those elementary school students in my home town were the real experts on what an elementary school playground should look like, so too are autistic teens the real experts on what a community place for themselves should be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End user engagement--always a wise idea!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241538670512"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-582730313457448545">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/657c20d129fccee9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Do High School Student Want to Become Scientists?</title><published>2009-05-05T15:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T15:53:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/do-high-school-student-want-to-become.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/582730313457448545/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=582730313457448545" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Do High School Student Want to Become Scientists? the answer is, no [Is Canada losing the lab-rat race?].&amp;quot;Look up &amp;#39;scientist&amp;#39; on Google,&amp;quot; the 16-year-old says, &amp;quot;and you will see someone in a lab coat.&amp;quot; At the moment, she is considering something with more immediate results, such as physiotherapy.Ask her biology classmates at Colonel By Secondary School in Ottawa if any of them want to be</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241538173436"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=10397">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/772a01ea2d694312</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="cars"/><category term="safety"/><title type="html">Would Electric Cars Increase Property Values on Noisy Streets?</title><published>2009-05-05T15:27:51Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T15:27:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/PJUd014wE9M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/would-electric-cars-increase-property-values-on-noisy-streets/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A reader named Tomas asks an interesting question:

I don’t mean free like free-from-the-clinic free or covered-by-insurance free, I mean $0 cost to you or anyone else. Unless, of course, it fails, then you’re talking about a few hundred dollars now or a couple hundred thousand or so for college tuition later. But it’s free now, and that’s what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church condones a single method of birth control, and that is “Natural Family Planning”, which is their jazzed-up-for-marketing name for the rhythm method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in this edition, I will be talking about the absolute worst way to avoid pregnancy, complete with an example of the kind of real-life dumb ass that would rely on such a method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Rhythm Method?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhythm method is a family planning strategy (I am going to refrain from calling it “birth control”) that relies on the timing of a woman’s cycle to determine what days are safe to have sex if you don’t want to get all knocked up. For purists, the plan is simply to count days - when the woman gets her period, that’s day 1. The next week and a half or so are “safe days”. The next week or so are “baby days” and then the rest of the cycle is free and clear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it should be noted that the method has been updated with new tips and tricks based on what people who &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get pregnant do. So, since couples who are trying to get pregnant do things like have sex during ovulation, and determine this using body temp and cervical mucous, people who are trying not to get pregnant simply don’t have sex during those fertile times, using the same indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How effective is the rhythm method?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an old joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. What do you call couples who use the rhythm method?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to determine the effectiveness of natural family planning when “used properly”. I’ve read that it has a 1-9% failure rate. Which is not very helpful. You’ll either get pregnant 1 in 100 times or about 1 in 10 times if you properly monitor everything every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical use, however, works about 75% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you use NFP perfectly, every month, your body may not cooperate, which would be fine if there was a way to know ahead of time that your ovaries will feel wonky next month. Alas, you cannot. And you may not know your cycle was off until your period is late. It could be late because your cycle is just behind schedule… or because Surprise! You’re experiencing the Miracle of Life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, before this method can even be used, a couple must chart the woman’s cycle for at least 2 months. During those two months, the couple must not use any hormonal birth control and must remain abstinent or use an alternative method of birth control. And even after those first two months are charted, it’s important to remember if either of those two months were off-months, you may soon be expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Really? 75% effective and you’re calling them ‘parents’? Come on.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75% of the time you won’t get pregnant using NFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70% of the time you won’t get pregnant if you’re actually trying to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think part of the issue is the fallacious assumption that if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; causes pregnancy, then &lt;em&gt;-x&lt;/em&gt; causes not-pregnancy. The problem is our bodies are far more nuanced than that, and not that obedient. Unfortunately, unless you trick your body or physically barricade your cervix, your body thinks it’s job is to make little skeptics*… and that’s what it’s going to try to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#999999"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*your body actually doesn’t care whether you make skeptics or not, as long as you make more people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what’s the verdict?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re indifferent to having babies, if you have a very mild desire to avoid pregnancy or if you actually have a driving urge to reproduce, this method is for you. I think it’s naive to call this “birth control”, since it’s just as effective as the “too hot and bothered to bother” birth control method, and just slightly more effective than actively trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually take issue with it being called “family planning” natural or otherwise. Since it’s marketed as a natural form of birth control, people actually rely on it as such. They’re very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; planning a family. An honest person would call this “tricking people into having babies they don’t want by calling it birth control”. Fortunately, pretty much everyone outside the Catholic Church call it such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condoned by the Catholic Church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No side effects from drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No allergies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 months of abstinence or non-hormonal alternative birth control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condoned by the Catholic Church&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot be combined with other forms of birth control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side effects may include pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait, if that’s not the worst birth control method, what is?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve been ignoring the warnings that “these things happen” and going about your life without a care. You’re thinking to yourself, “Hey, it took me like three years of trying to have even one baby. No worries!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you don’t use birth control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t use emergency contraception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You smugly tell your fellow Skepchicks that you don’t use any birth control because you don’t need it. Then you volunteer to write a series of posts on birth control options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day, you realize it’s been a while since your last period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, you’re due to have your second baby this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, if you’re like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insisting to yourself that you won’t get pregnant is the least intelligent way to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I tried it… and now I’m pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETA: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems many of you are confused as to whether I’m happy or in a blind rage about this. Mr. Elyse and I consider this to be very good, albeit unexpected, news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241534455430"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/scratch_that_idea_for_a_second.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac3a8fe87b4ab2f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Scratch that idea for a second honeymoon</title><published>2009-05-05T14:58:51Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T14:58:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/px7D_zbsdgA/scratch_that_idea_for_a_second.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/scratch_that_idea_for_a_second.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The advertising copy is right: &lt;a href="http://www.marriageinbali.com/"&gt;Bali &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; sound like an exotic wedding destination&lt;/a&gt;. But wouldn't you know it, there is a hitch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All couples who marry in Indonesia must declare a religion. Agnosticism and Atheism are not recognized. The Civil Registry Office can record marriages of persons of Islam, Hindu, Buddhist, Christian-Protestant and Christian-Catholic faiths. Marriage partners must have the same religion; otherwise one partner must make a written declaration of a change of religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trophy Wife will not be thrilled to learn that our marriage would not have been valid in Indonesia. The requirement that both partners in the relationship must have the same religion is also weird — there are probably a lot of people out there who have perfectly stable &amp;#39;mixed&amp;#39; marriages who would be surprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/scratch_that_idea_for_a_second.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/px7D_zbsdgA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241534455430"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/john_holbo_makes_a_discovery.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b8f2b16e6d6c9962</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">John Holbo makes a discovery</title><published>2009-05-05T14:37:45Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T14:37:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Tjcsso2ZZ1g/john_holbo_makes_a_discovery.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/john_holbo_makes_a_discovery.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;And it's &lt;i&gt;gorgeous&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2009/05/05/groovy-prog-rock-wannabe-biology-text-from-72-i-dont-know-what-else-to-call-the-post/"&gt;Holbo&lt;/a&gt; has found a set of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajourneyroundmyskull/sets/72157607421416604/"&gt;scans from a 1972 biology textbook&lt;/a&gt; (and an &lt;a href="http://ajourneyroundmyskull.blogspot.com/search/label/Biology%20Today"&gt;associated blog&lt;/a&gt;) that will &lt;i&gt;blow your mind, baby&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Homeopaths will tell you otherwise. They will tell you that water "memory," which, the way they describe it is some mystical property whereby it "remembers" the remedy with which it's been in contact, even though the substance (whatever it was) has been diluted far beyond the point where there's likely to be even one molecule of it left. Not only that, but they will, in all seriousness, tell you that dilution is not enough. They will insist that, at each serial dilution, the remedy must be vigorously shaken (or, as they call it, "succussed") in order to imbue it with its potency. Finally, they will tell you, without any evidence, that "like cures like," that giving a highly dilute, serially successed remedy made from the same substance that causes symptoms like the ones being treated will cure those symptoms. In other words, homeopathy is nothing more than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/05/doctor_strange_and_the_only_way_to_make.php"&gt;sympathetic magic suitable for use by Doctor Strange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is also utterly pseudoscientific. It posits the existence of a "memory" of water that no science has detected beyond infinitesimal fragments of a second so brief that there is no plausible physical mechanism by which such "memory" could survive long enough to do anything. In fact, there is no way for such "memory" to survive the transit across the GI tract, much less interact with cell surface receptors or cellular proteins to produce a pharmacological effect. Indeed, the concepts behind homeopathy conflict with so many well-established theories of science that, for homeopathy to be correct, much of what we know about physics, chemistry, and biology would have to be overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is water, and, when substituted for real medicine, i&lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-babys-parents-ignored-advice-qc-20090504-asmt.html"&gt;t can kill&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/homeopathy_kills_a_child.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/homeopathy_kills_a_child.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Vt1eImmapKo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241533985481"><id gr:original-id="546 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bc77e2cff7f3726</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Amazing Meeting (London): The Amazing Rip-Off</title><published>2009-05-05T12:57:31Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T12:57:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/546" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;bpsdb&lt;/a&gt;] So "&lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;The Amazing Meeting&lt;/a&gt;" is coming to London, and I hate to be cynical about it, but the only thing I can see that's particularly amazing is the price. JREF are charging £175 for the privilege of attending, plus a further £25 for the Saturday night events, bringing the total cost to a whopping £200. And it's too much. &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=8904&amp;amp;st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=a"&gt;It's much too much&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I'm deeply disappointed by the organisers.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now I would happily bet next month's rent that the response to this criticism will be that this is the sort of money that you need to bring in to secure the quality speakers invited, or to get hold of a decent London venue. To that I say 'twaddle'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptic.org.uk/events/skeptics-in-the-pub"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; manage to secure speakers of a similar quality (indeed, several of the speakers listed have attended SITP event, for example &lt;a&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;), and charge next to nothing for the privilege, never more than a couple of quid on the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for the venue, if you insist on hiring out the sort of venues normally used for professional conferences, then of course they're going to charge you an arm and a leg. Plenty of British theatres on the other hand can be rented out for £2-300 a day. A grand should easily cover a 2 day conference in a 400 seat theatre. Bring in 100-200 people and you're looking at £5-10 cost per ticket. If London is too expensive, go a little way outside - somewhere like Windsor is within 20 minutes or so of Paddington, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's a grand for the venue, let's be generous and triple that to cover a token fee for the speakers, and other administrative costs (for catering let's just book a couple of local restaurants and let people pay their own way). That gives us a budget for our alternative meeting of £3000. That's just £15 each for 200 people. If &lt;a&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt; sells a similar number of tickets they'll be raking in £35,000. The only thing being gained for this price as far as I can see is the corporate-style venue, and the ability to pay for the travel expenses of the American speakers. For a hundred quid I could accept that - for two hundred it's a steep price to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having said all that, I've been to many conferences, and some of them have cost substantially more than this one, but there is a huge difference though between a professional conference and what amounts to basically a fan convention. and that's the problem - TAM are pitching this event at the level of a professional conference, while presenting nothing better in terms of quality than an average SITP meet up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past TAM events in the States they've had workshops and paper sessions, and these would be great. They would add value for writers and bloggers like myself who are keen to try and push their work to the next level. If I could go along and find out how to get published in CiF, or make friends with a science editor, or increase my audience or secure some paid writing work then it would be worth investing the cash being there. But none of this will happen, it's just £175 to listen to a couple of Americans talking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing is that of course people will pay up. In that respect, I feel like the "true" Manchester United fans that have been priced out of their own stadium. Grassroots UK skeptics aren't welcome at TAM London, just the rich and curious. All I can suggest is that we pack up our tents, and join a camped protest at the door. That'll give the &lt;a href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/prawn-sandwich%20brigade"&gt;prawn-sandwich brigade&lt;/a&gt; something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most college special education masters programs do not include comprehensive instruction in reading for dyslexics. &lt;/strong&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, dyslexics or children with reading disorders make up 70-80% of the special education students. Is there any wonder why special education reading scores are so low?
 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does this happen?
 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best, most potential teachers will get just an overview in reading, Few colleges, if any teach one of the few methodologies proven by the International Dyslexia Association. These methodologies are taught by private companies or certified individuals, not colleges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owners of the methodologies are not big text book publishers like Harcourt, SRA, etc that can afford lobbyists to push state politicians and administrators to approve their curriculum&amp;#39;s. Publishers make money by selling hundreds of thousands of text books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 
True research-based proven methodologies for dyslexics are multi-sensory based. The original is Orton Gillingham. The rest are based on the theories of Orton Gillingham are Wilson, Slingerland and Spaulding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exception to the rule is Lindamood Bell LiPS (Lindamood Phonemic Sequencing) which is a proven multi-sensory methodology. &lt;a href="http://www.lindamoodbell.com/research/research-articles.html"&gt;http://www.lindamoodbell.com/research/research-articles.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to use these methodologies properly, teachers must have intensive instruction, consistent mentoring and follow up. Teachers cannot go to a two day or one week workshop and then come back and teach the rest of the staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is the current model in SFUSD. Last years professional development calendar did not include a single workshop in reading instruction for dyslexics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;the child who is not taking part in the typical parent-child dance — exchanging smiles and glances, pointing at something of interest, seeking attention — is missing out on a lot of learning and failing to lay the foundations for more complex social behavior. Rather than become experts on social cues, as most humans are wired to do, these children, observes Klin, tend to focus on the physical world — the opening and closing of doors and the properties of inanimate objects.

JREF are charging £175 for the privilege of attending, plus a further £25 for the Saturday night events, bringing the total cost to a whopping £200. And it's too much, as the folks over at Bad Science have &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=8904&amp;amp;st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=a"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now I would happily bet next month's rent that the response to this criticism will be that this is the sort of money that you need to bring in to secure the quality speakers invited, or to get hold of a decent London venue, but I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptic.org.uk/events/skeptics-in-the-pub"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; manage to secure speakers of a similar quality (indeed, several of the speakers listed have attended SITP event, for example &lt;a&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;), and charge next to nothing for the privilege, never more than a couple of quid on the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for the venue, if you insist on hiring out the sort of venues normally used for professional conferences, then of course they're going to charge you an arm and a leg. Plenty of British theatres on the other hand can be rented out for £2-300 a day. A grand should easily cover a 2 day conference in a 400 seat theatre. Bring in 100-200 people and you're looking at £5-10 cost per ticket. If London is too expensive, go a little way outside - somewhere like Windsor is within 20 minutes or so of Paddington, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's a grand for the venue, let's be generous and triple that to cover a token fee for the speakers, and other administrative costs (for catering let's just book a couple of local restaurants and let people pay their own way). That gives us a budget for our alternative meeting of £3000. That's just £15 each for 200 people. If &lt;a&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt; sells a similar number of tickets they'll be raking in £35,000. The only thing being gained for this price as far as I can see is the corporate-style venue, and the ability to pay for the travel expenses of the American speakers. For a hundred quid I could accept that - for two hundred it's a steep price to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having said all that, I've been to many conferences, and some of them have cost substantially more than this one, but there is a huge difference though between a professional conference and what amounts to basically a fan convention. and that's the problem - TAM are pitching this event at the level of a professional conference, while presenting nothing better in terms of quality than an average SITP meet up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past TAM events in the States they've had workshops and paper sessions, and these would be great. They would add value for writers and bloggers like myself who are keen to try and push their work to the next level. If I could go along and find out how to get published in CiF, or make friends with a science editor, or increase my audience or secure some paid writing work then it would be worth investing the cash being there. But none of this will happen, it's just £175 to listen to a couple of Americans talking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing is that of course people will pay up. In that respect, I feel like the "true" Manchester United fans that have been priced out of their own stadium. Grassroots UK skeptics aren't welcome at TAM London, just the rich and curious. All I can suggest is that we pack up our tents, and join a camped protest at the door.

The post focused on Dr. Hongyun Huang and his clinic, but there are, unfortunately, many others. A new Chinese stem cell clinic, &lt;a href="http://www.beike.ch/en/Dr-Sean-Hu"&gt;Beike Biotechnologies&lt;/a&gt;, has been in the news recently, showing that the practice, if anything, is growing in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of stem cells to treat neurological injury or degenerative disease is certainly a promising idea. In 10-20 years such treatments may not only be a reality, they may revolutionize our approach to some diseases. But there is a long lead up of scientific research before a new biomedical technology becomes a reality - if it ever does. This often means that there is a long period of media hype preceding scientific reality. This has been especially true for stem cells, likely resulting from the ethical controversy and partial Bush Administration ban on stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of clinics and companies around the world, but especially in China, taking advantage of this premature media hype, and the desperation of people with serious injury. They are offering stem cell treatments now, and claiming stunning rates of cures. At the same time they are offering zero scientific evidence to back up their claims. That is a formula well known to those of use who pay attention to health fraud - stunning claims combined with a lack of rigorous scientific evidence = fraud. At least that is a reasonable default assumption until the evidence is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the greater the treatment effect being claimed the easier it would be to document scientifically. Large treatment effects and high rates of success can be documented relatively easily with relatively few subjects. So why haven’t they done so? They have no legitimate excuse. In fact, if their treatments worked as claimed they would be doing the world a huge disservice by failing to document it in a way that would convince the scientific and medical world. They are depriving millions of patients effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr, Sean Hu from Beike Biotechnology was recently &lt;a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/bio/stem-cell-therapy-today-peoples-republic"&gt;interviewed by Karolyn Y. Zeng for H+ magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The interview, in my opinion, is absolutely terrible from a journalistic point of view. Her questions are obvious and she never asks the hard questions - where is the scientific evidence, and why are your claims not generally accepted. The result was little more than an advertisement for Hu’s clinic. In the interview Dr. Hu claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of February 2009, Beike has treated over 5,087 patients with cord blood stem cell injections for diseases like ataxia, autism, ALS, brain trauma, cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral palsy, diabetics, Guillain-Barre, encephalatropy, and spinal cord injury – many of these are considered incurable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think “encephalatropy” is supposed to be encephalopathy.)  Here we see another red flag for quackery - the claim that a host of different conditions can be treated with a single therapy. These conditions involve the brain, the spinal cord, and the peripheral nerves - all with distinct cell types and characteristics that would likely not be treated by the same type of stem cells. Autism is also a very different kind of disorder from the other entities as there is no cell damage that we know of. Although the exact nature of autism remains unknown, it appears to be the result of differences in brain organization and communication - not cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Dr. Hu offers instead of scientific evience is yet another red flag for quackery - anecdotes. He even encourages his patients to keep a blog of their experience at the clinic. As I have discussed numerous times before, anecdotes are highly misleading and are not a way to discern whether or not a treatment works. Here is one story being reported on a spinal cord injury blog, regarding one patient with ataxia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Immediately, I was about 20 per cent better,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Since returning to Canada in February, he’s had a relapse of symptoms. But he says that was probable considering the degenerative nature of ataxia. He’s now looking at other stem-cell treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells do not work “immediately” even if they do work.  So any report of immediate recovery is suspect, and is likely either due to the placebo effect or to a temporary response to anesthesia or some other aspect of the treatment. Of course, this temporary effect quickly faded leading to the “relapse”, which the patient rationalized as a result of the degenerative nature of his condition. However, it is easier explained as a simple treatment failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect is likely to be particularly large in this situation as well. Patients spend 20+ thousand dollars for the treatment, more if you include travel expenses. Twenty percent, according to Hu, get follow up treatments at the same price.  This is often against the advice of their doctors back home who are appropriately skeptical. This creates a huge psychological need to justify the decision and the expense. I have personally seen this in my own patients who have gone for controversial treatments. Even with no objective improvement in exam or function, they will find something to justify their decision. It is often a sad display of the human potential for self-deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hu claims that his company, and China in general, is just way ahead of the western medical establishment.  This is simply not credible. No one is that far ahead - there simply has not been enough time. It is true that research was slowed in the US by the Bush ban, but not by that much. And research continued in Korea, Japan and Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is that the technology is not yet at the point where there are proven effective treatments - let alone for a long list of the hardest neurological disorders to treat. Researchers are still working out the basic science and technology - making stem cells from various sources, investigating their properties, learning how to use them, to get them to do what we want without causing cancer or other unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best we are at the point where early clinical trials are possible for a limited number of the easiest conditions to treat. So Hu and these other Chinese clinics are claiming they are not just ahead of the rest of the world, but by one to two decades.  And they have nothing to show for it in the way of scientific evidence. They may or may not be sincere in their claims, but that does not matter. This is unacceptable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a financial boon for these clinics - they can charge 20 thousand dollars per treatment, and rich desperate westerners are glad to give it to them. Desperate patients are also in no position to do anything about it if the treatments fail. They are given no guarantees. The treatments are experimental, and they know they are taking a chance. If they are harmed they have no recourse. The situation is ripe for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also very difficult to dissuade patients from seeking such treatments.  The possibility of hope, no matter how tenuous, is simply too much of a lure. When journalists or bloggers try to do a “balanced” treatment of the topic they typically include scientific skepticism and anecdotes of sucess. Of course most patients will find the anecdotes more compelling. And much of the journalism, like the Zeng interview, is not balanced and ends up being gushing and promotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present all we can do is educate patients about the situation and give our advice and hope they make the right decision.  We could also put pressure on the Chinese government to better regulate these clinics, but that seems unlikely. Also, there are similar clinics in many countries, not just China. This is one of those unintended consequences of globalization - fraudulent clinics can be set up outside of regulatory jurisdiction, and then clients can be lured there through advertising and gullible journalism on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While hopes for stem cell therapy remain legitimately large, we are not there yet. Any treatment currently being offered should be in the context of a properly designed clinical trial, with informed consent and ethical oversight. Any clinic selling stem cell therapies for thousands of dollars is therefore likely to be a cruel fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

(1) &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;amp;newsId=20090430006527&amp;amp;newsLang=en"&gt;U.S. Army Brigadier General Becky Halstead (Retired) Speaks Out for Chiropractic Care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(2) &lt;a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/149071"&gt;Chiropractic Helps Child with Brain Disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(3) &lt;a href="http://www.planetc1.com/cgi-bin/n/v.cgi?c=1&amp;amp;id=1240864592"&gt;Swine Flu Chiropractor’s Handout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) General Halstead has become a spokesperson for The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing public awareness of chiropractic. Her quoted comments boil down to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the personal attention and caring I get from my chiropractor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic advice about healthy lifestyle is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic care prevents more serious health concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractic is essential for assisting in recovery from minor injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractors don’t mask the problem with drugs and all their side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiropractors are holistic and involve the patient in her own care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Listening appears to be a major tool.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing but opinion based on personal experience and scientific ignorance. She offers no evidence that chiropractic theory is true, that chiropractic adjustments are effective, or that a chiropractor has any advantage over a science-based medical doctor who also spends time listening to patients, is interested in the whole patient, advises about healthy lifestyle, and avoids unnecessary use of drugs. Caring clinicians can be found in chiropractic, in homeopathy, in every kind of quackery, and in scientific medicine, with the advantage that the scientific clinician can also provide effective evidence-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a woman and a retired Air Force colonel, I am doubly ashamed that this high-ranking military woman has prostituted herself by becoming a spokesperson for pseudoscience. I hope they are paying her well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) The &lt;a href="http://www.atypon-link.com/MCY/doi/abs/10.5555/pmfh.2009.2009.1.1e"&gt;“research,” reported in the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal &amp;amp; Family Health – Chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;, is not really what I would call research. It describes a case of a child with cerebellar ataxia whose problems completely resolved following four chiropractic adjustments. The report speculates that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the increase in the diagnosis of such disorders as ADHD, pervasive developmental disorder, Tourette’s Syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders, have their root in abnormal spinal development. Children’s nervous systems need the constant stimulation of movement in order to develop and function properly. Abnormal position or movement of the spinal vertebra can develop and this can lead to nerve interference. It is this interference, called vertebral subluxations, that chiropractors correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, but these subluxations have never been shown to exist outside the imagination of chiropractors, and the alleged nerve interference has never been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t access the entire article without paying $50, but the abstract raised a lot of questions. A seven year old girl “presented for chiropractic care and cerebellar ataxia was noted.” Was this an incidental observation by the chiropractor, or had the child been previously diagnosed with documented ataxia? The chiropractor’s exam “isolated the location of trans-neuronal dysfunction to the right cerebellum.” How? What does “trans-neuronal dysfunction” even mean? Even the grammar is faulty: “Chiropractic analysis of static and motion palpation were used to examine the spine for subluxations.” The wording makes it unclear what the treatment was: adjustments were given “in either the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and/or pelvic region as needed. Neuro-rehabilitative exercises were given either at home and/or during the office visit.” “Within four visits there was marked improvement of gait patterns and resolution of the ataxia.” Really? Or did the chiropractor and parents simply convince themselves they saw improvement? Was cerebellar ataxia really there in the first place? Did a medical doctor confirm the diagnosis? Was there any long-term followup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract’s conclusion is propaganda, not a conclusion based on the study. It consists of speculation that is in no way justified by the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding and applying foundational neurological principles via a patient specific, individually tailored, chiropractic management plan is essential. Assessing and optimizing asymmetrical neurological indicators should be part of screening and management procedures. In this case, addressing the dysfunction concerning the central integrative state of the cerebellum was necessary for optimum functioning of this seven-year-old female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case report, little more than a testimonial. I hope the body of the article clarifies some of the questions the abstract raises, but I have seen many, many similar chiropractic case reports that are poorly documented, that mix treatments so it is impossible to determine what caused the improvement, and that are eminently unconvincing. The value of case reports is that they can help guide future research. This seldom happens in chiropractic; there is no progress over time, and reports like this do not build into a coherent body of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Nicoleta Borcean, has no articles listed either on PubMed or in the Index to Chiropractic Literature. The journal this article was published in is a brand-new one, and I question both its concept and its editorial board. Why do we need a journal of “Pediatric, Maternal &amp;amp; Family Health- Chiropractic”? There is no evidence that chiropractic has any role in pediatric or maternal health, and the attempt of some chiropractors to become “family doctors” is misguided. The editor in chief is a professor at &lt;a href="http://www.healthwatcher.net/chirowatch.com/Chiro-schools/Life/macon020907lifedenied.html"&gt;Life University, a scandal-ridden school that was denied recertification in 2002 &lt;/a&gt;because it offered substandard education. One editorial board member is Barbara Loe Fisher, Co-Founder &amp;amp; President of the National Vaccine Information Center – an anti-vaccine organization. Other board members are associated with the Academy of Chiropractic Family Practice and the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, organizations whose raison d’être is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not making an ad hominem argument. I’m not saying these individuals couldn’t produce a high-quality journal. But in this case, they haven’t; and their background helps explain why. The abstracts in the current issue are all case reports similar to the ataxia one. “I treated a patient and he got better” is meaningless unless you can show that you’re not making a &lt;em&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc &lt;/em&gt;error. The journal appears to be more interested in finding evidence to support chiropractic claims than in doing good science to test whether chiropractic claims are true. Pseudoscience tries to show “that” a treatment works; real science asks “if” it really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Chiropractors were among the first alternative providers to jump on the Swine Flu bandwagon. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/538-chiropractics-answer-to-swine-flu-get-adjusted.html"&gt;I already wrote about this for the JREF’s &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll repeat it here. Their handout boils down to 6 recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your immune system by getting adjusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the amount of sugar in your diet because sugar depresses the immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid alcohol and white flour products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink more water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disinfect your rooms by spraying them with a solution of essential oils (4 drops to one cup of water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey! One out of six isn’t bad. Handwashing is a good idea. The rest of this advice is useless for preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tell us “Studies show that being adjusted twice a week can increase your immune system function by up to 400%.” No they don’t. I couldn’t find even one such study. I did find &lt;a href="http://www.risoldi.com/_fileCabinet/ris_Immunity.pdf"&gt;a reference to “preliminary research”&lt;/a&gt; – apparently not published – that allegedly showed that patients who had received long term chiropractic care had 200% greater immune competence than patients who had not received chiropractic care and 400% greater than those who had cancer. This is uninterpretable because we are not told how the data were collected nor how “immune competence” was measured. Maybe sicker people are already seeing MDs and are less likely to see chiropractors. Besides which, the damage from flu is due to the immune response, and it’s conceivable that increasing immune competence might be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is NO credible evidence that chiropractic adjustments decrease the risk of catching ANYTHING. Ditto sugar, white flour and alcohol (unless perhaps indirectly due to secondary effects of overindulgence). Drinking more water? No evidence. And spraying dilute essential oils is probably as effective as having a witch doctor wave a bone and chant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractic may help some people with musculoskeletal pain, but reading news items like these doesn’t help my blood pressure!&lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully this will greatly slow the progression of osteoarthritis already apparent in the hip joint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of which means I have plenty of blogging time to make up for the past month or so, as well as an extremely bruised arse. A friend wryly offered me some arnica ("&lt;a href="http://www.arnicare.co.uk/how-does-arnica-work_pg10.aspx"&gt;everyone knows&lt;/a&gt; that arnica heals bruising") so I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WC5-4C892YG-24&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_origUdi=B6WCS-4GJK86P-1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_coverDate=02%2F29%2F1984&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_orig=article&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=f0bf1a38d6a7ae4695cbe47423bddddc"&gt;sent her&lt;/a&gt; an (admittedly small) placebo controlled trial comparing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"&gt;metronidazole&lt;/a&gt; with arnica and placebo in the prevention of post-surgical complications. The trial showed the metronidazole did what it was supposed to, but more interestingly, the arnica gave rise to more pain and increased swelling compared to placebo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homeopaths have an odd relationship with arthritis in general. The reasons for getting osteoarthritis are not at clear - there appears to be a large element of heredity involved, with obesity and previous joint injury also playing an important part. There is plenty of research going in to finding out why it happens, because the truth is, we don't completely know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or perhaps I should qualify that statement - 'we' includes the medical establishment and arthritis charities, but doesn't include homeopaths. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://college-of-practical-homeopathy.com/arthritis.htm"&gt;College of Practical Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; in London would rather have you believe that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Poor nutrition, allergies, infections and food sensitivities can lead to [arthritis] problems. Overuse and dietary imbalance can lead to a breakdown of cartilage.&lt;/blockquote&gt; More bizarrely, arthritic conditions are linked to &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;the underlying emotional states of resentment, feeling victimized, bitterness and lacking in love.&lt;/blockquote&gt; That's right, your arthritis will get worse unless you get yourself some good ol' loving and stop being such a sourpuss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I'm trapped in the modern medical paradigm of wanting my disease cured, or failing that, having the symptoms managed so that I can live with the problem, unlike the complementary therapists who look at you holistically:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our practically trained Homeopaths will establish the causes of your symptoms. If they can see clear causes (physical traumas or emotional shock etc), in your time line, they may treat these first before going on to a detox program.&lt;/blockquote&gt; You see, if people come to a homeopath regarding arthritis, they'll already know the causes of the symptoms - it's the arthritis. You can tell them that it's because they are unloved or that they don't eat enough goji berries, but that would be bollocks. And a '&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article5517912.ece"&gt;detox&lt;/a&gt;' (a crock of nonsense in itself) will do nothing for arthritis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They will take into consideration your nutritional states, and support you in developing a healthier approach to your nutritional needs and in taking action to achieve a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/blockquote&gt; More confusion - what are they going to do for the arthritis? And why are they calling themselves homeopaths? There's nothing homeopathic in their plan. In summary, they are incorrect in the causes, they are bizarre in their understanding of disease progression, and they are clueless about their own ability. They'll happily take your your money of course, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;caveat emptor&lt;/span&gt; but, as long they don't do anything inappropriate, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/03/department-of-health-response-to-cnhc.html"&gt;Ofquack&lt;/a&gt;, the 'regulator', is happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fisher_(physician)"&gt;Dr Peter Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, homeopath to the Royal Family is confused:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Osteoarthritis ... is basically 'wear and tear' of the joints.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Whoops, wrong again. So give us an example, Dr Fisher, of a cause of arthritis. No seriously. The article is &lt;a href="http://www.arthriticassociation.org.uk/index.php?section=news&amp;amp;page=newsletter/autumn_2004/homeopathy_for_arthritis_and_rheumatism"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, a woman came to consult me with extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis...when I enquired into the social background it turned out she had been through a messy divorce, including a court battle for custody of the children, which she eventually won. The onset of her illness coincided almost to the day with the end of the custody case. I was amazed that she did not make the connection.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Ah yes, causes of arthritis include joint injury, obesity, heredity and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;custody battles&lt;/span&gt;? This is the royal physician, remember. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last part of this fun rant, I'd like to direct you to an article written on the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society Website, titled &lt;a href="http://www.rheumatoid.org.uk/article.php?article_id=80"&gt;"Homeopathy in Rheumatoid Arthritis"&lt;/a&gt;. The article was written by Professor David L Scott of King's College, London and near the end, discusses a small clinical trial (58 people) of rheumatoid arthritis that was 15 years in the preparation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;During the 6 months of treatment the pain scores fell by 18%, their tender joint counts fell by 24% and their and ESRs fell by 11%. However these improvements were unrelated to homeopathic treatment. They reflected the fact that only patients with improving disease could remain on this type of therapy. Not only were there no benefits from homeopathic treatment but the placebo-treated cases actually showed greater improvements in pain scores. Mean pain scores were significantly lower after 3 months' placebo therapy than 3 months' active homeopathic therapy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  I'm not sure if this was ever published - PUBMed draws a blank - but Prof Scott is 'unclear how to interpret the negative results', concerning more with the question of &lt;blockquote&gt;is it cost-effective to complement conventional therapy in patients requesting homeopathy? It seems more important to define if homeopathists can genuinely control patients' symptoms and less relevant to have concerns about whether this is due to a ‘genuine’ effect or to influencing the placebo response.&lt;/blockquote&gt; I disagree with this completely - and so should every self-respecting homeopath, but for different reasons. Surely homeopaths don't look at symptoms, they look at the whole person? Surely, any self-respecting homeopath with belief in the religion of dilution would be looking to reestablish the 'natural curing abilities of the body' and remove the rheumatoid arthritis completely? Surely only nasty 'conventional' medicine treats only the symptoms?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's pretty clear to me from the homeopaths themselves they are clueless about arthritis - it's cause, it's progression and most importantly, it's alleviation and cure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's without having to mention that homeopathy itself is drivel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-7213368657832342523?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241522182957"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3599">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe85e72bc9b48c24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bees"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Food"/><category term="Gardening"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="native species"/><category term="pollination"/><title type="html">Pollinator Action Alert: Farm Bill in Senate</title><published>2009-05-05T11:13:33Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T11:13:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/pollinator-action-alert-farm-bill-in-senate/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got an email recently from the &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/action-alerts/pollinator-funding.html"&gt;Xerces Society about some senatorial action&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Please contact your Senators and ask them to sign on to a letter by Senator Boxer in support of vital research on agricultural pollinators. …&lt;strong&gt;The deadline for  Senators to sign on to this letter is Wednesday, May 6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Providing funding for research into the causes and remedies of honey bee and native bee declines is a critical step in pollinator conservation….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senator Boxer has written  a letter&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;requesting that the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee allocate $20 million in Fiscal Year 2010 for pollinator research projects as authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill….to promote the health of honey bees and native pollinators through habitat conservation and best management practices.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/19/MNBR107C59.DTL&amp;amp;type=printable"&gt;additional coverage of Boxer’s actions here&lt;/a&gt;; including blurbs from May Berenbaum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download a free PDF of “&lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/action-alerts/pollinator-funding.html"&gt;Using Farm Bill Programs for Pollinator Conservation&lt;/a&gt;” at the Xerces site; it’s a joint USDA-NRCS-Xerces publication.  It discusses how existing farm programs (Conservation reserve, etc) can be used to promote native bee populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;a href="http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nests_for_native_bees_fact_sheet_xerces_society.pdf"&gt;PDF on building next boxes for native bees&lt;/a&gt;.  And, make sure you check out &lt;a href="http://buzzybeegirl.wordpress.com/"&gt;Anna’s new posts&lt;/a&gt; on her spring bees!  Pretty pictures! &lt;a href="http://buzzybeegirl.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/ooooosomething-shiny/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is in all sorts of different background colors and multiple sizes and it switches over sometimes in the middle of a word. It's truly Timecube-esque.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Please do not buy any of the dolls I am listing to give to a child…they are not toys! If you easily frightened or are not prepared to handle any experiences you may have as a result of bringing these dolls into your home, then you should not bid!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is advertising speak for "What are you? A pussy?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My grandmother always collected dolls, and as a child I never knew why I wasn't allowed playing with her "special" dolls, until they were giving to me after her passing tHREE years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Turns out they were full of weed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;She called them special each one having their own names and places they were kept.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Mary Jane," "Angola," "Cheeba," and "Don Juan," she called them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Each of these dolls I will place on auction not because I don't want them any longer, it is because they deserve someone who will give them the attention and care I cannot give them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Plus they smell like skunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Since I have been selling my grandmother's dolls, I have learned alot about hauntings and spirits, so I have started doing EVP's (voice recordings that you cannot hear with the naked ear) on my Grandmother's dolls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Naked ear?" I'm not sure that idiom is translatable in that fashion. "I have a cold so I can't smell that with my naked nose."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also recorded them with my night vision video camera.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There's just something about green-tinted footage that appeals to both paranormal goofballs and accidental porn stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The shots and recordings I have gotten were amazing! I never knew that these dolls were as active as they were.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Crikey!&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On many of the recordings I have heard them talking among each other, laughing, crying, yelling, some where easy to make out, some were very hard, and some I couldnt make out at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Grandma must have laced her stash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is one of the MANY dolls given to me by my Grandmother,her name is CHEYENNE.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Maybe the &lt;i&gt;doll&lt;/i&gt; is in porn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CHEYENNE IS THE LOVING POSITIVE SPIRIT OF A 16 YEAR OLD YOUNG WOMAN.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funny. I remember 16-year-old "young women" being mostly bitchy and self-centered. Maybe death improved adolescence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CHEYENNE WILL TURN OFF/ON LIGHTS, CLOSE DOORS, RUMMAGE IN MY JEWELRY BOXES, AND MAKE-UP CASES,&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thief!&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TURN OFF/ON THE STEREO, I HAVE SEEN CHEYENNE AS A WHITE LIGHT ORBS AND AS A BLURRY APPARITION. &lt;/blockquote&gt;"I've seen things that don't look anything like the doll but that are totally the doll."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CHEYENNE STARTED DATING A BOY IN HER HIGH SCHOOL.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is some serious "Bride of Chucky" shit now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;HE WAS HER FIRST BOYFRIEND, SHE FELL DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, the perils of dating shemales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BUT HE DIDNT, HE INVITED HER TO A PARTY AT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HOUSE, WHERE HE DRUGGED HER HE BEAT HER AND HIM AND HIS FRIENDS GANG RAPED HER. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, look at that "fuck me" doll dress! She was askin' for it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CHEYENNE WAS OVERDOSED AND NEVER WOKE UP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I wonder what kind of drugs it takes to knock out a doll?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;~PHYSICAL APPERANCE: CHEYENNE IS A PORCELAIN DOLL.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;HER HEAD,ARMS AND LEGS ARE PORCELAIN HER BODY IS CLOTHE.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I redact my former statement; she was not askin' for it because of her doll dress, but instead because of that skimpy clothe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SHE MEASURES APPROX 18" TALL.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wouldn't you measure the length on a doll? How do you stand it up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;~IF YOU FEEL A CONNECTION TO CHEYENNE THEN YOU SHOULD BID, YOU COULD BE THE ONE DESTINED TO WATCH OVER HER AND KEEP HER SAFE FROM HARM!~&lt;/blockquote&gt;And from the vice squad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iFyou have any questions feel free to email me, and i will answer your questions as best as i can. *EMAILS OF AN INAPPROPRIATE MANOR WILL BE IGNORED OR REPORTED TO EBAY, SO DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MINE WRITING THEM!*&lt;/blockquote&gt;Appropriate manors include Wayne Manor and Manor Farm. Wuthering Heights is right out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;These dolls and their spirit hosts do not perform on command, they are the vessel of live spirits, from someone who lived and attached their spirits with the doll for some reason or another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So if you don't see anything, that's just cuz the dolls didn't decide to do anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not know ALL the life history of these spirits that are attached to these dolls,(but I am slowly learning on some) I only know a name my grandmother had given each of them, and my person experience with each of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And your "person experience" is informing your study of their "life histories" how, again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I explain my experiences with each of the dolls’ spirits, that does not mean that you will experience the same, it matters how you connect with the doll and their spirits hosts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Claims not typical. Experiences may vary."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On some of my dolls I have my Aunt Celeste whose a medium/clarovoyant read the dolls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;How come I don't have a psychic relative? I want one of those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My dolls are not "evil", some have more attitude than others, they have their own unique personality, because they were all living, breathing individuals at one time or another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;They're not evil, they're just PMSing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Due to the fact that paranormal item or items are involved in this sale, I am "forced" by Ebay’s rules and regulations to make the following statement&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why the quotes? How are you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; forced? How is the forcing somehow farcical or fictitious in nature?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;this is for entertainment purposes only; we cannot be responsible for any activity which may or may not be associated with this sale.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And furthermore, why pretend to be forced when you spent the entire last paragraph essentially saying just that in so many words?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seller here had multiple "haunted" dolls for sale...What a racket! Buy a $50 box of cheap dolls, rough them up a bit, make up some nonsense about their "lives" and "activity," and start the bidding at US$12.50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least nobody had placed a bid yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-8555575282914221296?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241516243082"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-3966594480898178402">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01501cd81e43b695</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">On cam lesions, homeopathy and Freedom of Information oddities.</title><published>2009-05-05T09:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T09:37:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-cam-lesions-homeopathy-and-freedom.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/3966594480898178402/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=96088503557170302&amp;postID=3966594480898178402" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/96088503557170302-3966594480898178402?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241514924687"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1406">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/992fb1c96e5bb5dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Awesomeness"/><category term="The academic scene"/><title type="html">Shy linguists at Berkeley this summer</title><published>2009-05-05T09:00:23Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T09:00:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1406" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, so Geoff Nunberg &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1402"&gt;plugged his new book&lt;/a&gt; here on Language Log.  Shamelessly. But in fact he is shy, very shy. He is one of the quiet National Public Radio superstars who move among us invisibly, dynamic and brilliant and yet never recognized in the streets.  He could have plugged the fact that he is teaching a &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/courses/lsa131.html"&gt;course on Language and Public Discourse&lt;/a&gt; this summer at Berkeley, in the &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Linguistic Institute&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by the Linguistic Society of America.  You could register, and take that course at an amazingly low fee.  But you simply didn't know about it, because he is too shy to mention it.  It's 10:30 to 12:15 Mondays and Wednesdays between July 6 and 23.  Of course, you would need a course for the afternoon as well; but then (I point this out with all due modesty) you could have a bite of lunch and then take &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/courses/lsa110.html"&gt;my course on English Grammar&lt;/a&gt; from 1:30 to 3:15 on those days. There is a &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/Courses.html"&gt;staggering list&lt;/a&gt; of heartbreakingly tempting courses by towering geniuses from all subfields of linguistics, in fact. Nearly all of them too shy to tell you how great they are (though I think &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/courses/lsa127.html"&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; would hint at it if you pressed him). Shy linguists teaching brilliant courses all summer at low rates in gorgeous northern California. Language Log personalities you could meet in the flesh. This could be the ultimate most fantastic summer of your life, if you just thought to yourself "&lt;i&gt;Carpe diem!&lt;/i&gt;," and &lt;a href="http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/Registration.html"&gt;signed up&lt;/a&gt;. Or you could just hang out at home and watch summer reruns on TV of course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Charlie diagnosed with autism when he was an infant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under twelve years ago, when my son Charlie was a baby, I would have thought the notion of diagnosing him at such a young age preposterous. How, much less why, could anyone saddle such a young child with such a diagnosis? Wasn't he just &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; young?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to now when I read about researchers finding the first "symptoms of autism" in babies, in the May 4th &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1895357,00.html"&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show the average 18-month-old a video of toddlers at play, and you can bet that the tot will be mesmerized by scenes with strong emotion: a fight or kiss. But some babies have other interests. At the Yale Child Study Center, psychologists Warren Jones, Ami Klin and Sarah Shultz measure when toddlers stop blinking — a reliable indicator of rapt attention. The typical child will stare at the scene of a kiss, but a child with autism will be transfixed by the opening and closing of a door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments like these, presented at a recent conference at Columbia University's Teachers College, are helping researchers identify the signs of autism at ever earlier ages. For parents, says Stone, director of Vanderbilt's Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders, "the average age of first concern is 17 months, though a diagnosis isn't typically made until age 3. That's a long time to be concerned and not know what to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see my son being "transfixed by the opening and closing of a door": At 10 months, he spent much time looking long and absorbedly in sunbeams, pictures in board books, a stack of plastic cups.  But "staring too long at inanimate objects" is the one trait that stands out. The &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1895357,00.html"&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article notes other early "warning signs" of autism in a young child, namely, "not responding to one's name; not sharing interests through pointing and eye gaze; lack of joyful expression; an absence of babbling; difficulty establishing eye contact; and staring too long at inanimate objects." Of these, the ones that most characterize my son as an infant were that he did not share "interests through pointing and eye gaze"---Charlie did not have "joint attention." He might be fascinated by a blue rectangular block, but he'd look at it and not try to share his delight in that block with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was (and remains) a child with a frequently "joyful expression." As a baby, he babbled a bit, but not excessively. What stands out to me is that the traits noted by the researchers which most describe Charlie are all about his attentiveness towards inanimate objects vs. human subjects. He certainly did (and still does) spend a fair amount of time looking at patterns of colored blocks or certain pictures in books. On the other hand Charlie is a social kid who likes the company of others and was described as "friendly" by his teacher on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_way_up"&gt;his most recent IEP&lt;/a&gt;. This makes me suspect that the desire to be social and be among others has long been intrinsic Charlie, but his motor and other skills were not yet developed, so that he just was not yet able to focus as well on moving, unpredictably, constantly changing beings---other people, with our constantly shifting speech and gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said before that I would have liked to have &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/very-early-diagnosis-and-the-very-early-autism-phenotype/"&gt;known Charlie's diagnosis as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;, to prepare myself and to prepare for him---the past twelve years since Charlie's birth have been, you could say, an extended re-education in how to take care of a child-becoming-a-teenager-becoming-an-adult who has a lot of needs that society, as things currently stand, cannot meet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have argued that the earlier we find out that a child has autism, the greater and more numerous will be attempts to in effect quash autism at the start. While there is currently no &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/prenatal-genetic-testing-and-lots-of-questions/"&gt;prenatal genetic test&lt;/a&gt; for autism, the possibility seems not unlikely---but what would expecting parents do with the result of such a test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the phrase "autism advocacy" can refer both to efforts to provide more services and supports for individuals on the autism spectrum---to what we can do for individuals on the autism spectrum in the here and now ---and also to efforts to find out more about autism to better understand it and development "treatments" for it. For myself, advocacy needs to be first and foremost about people here and today, rather than about worrying ourselves about preventing yet undiagnosed, and even unborn children, from being on the autism spectrum. All for the good to know earlier about whether or not a child has autism, but this knowledge should be used to start a blueprint for planning for a life that's going to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;my son's early diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;---he was diagnosed in July of 1999, just as he was turning 2---we have been able to educate him and to make changes in our lives for him that, Jim and I think, have been ultimately to his benefit; have ensured that Charlie is and (we hope) continues to be a member of society, rather than a problem who has be segregated and cast away. In the wake of the creation of another autism organization with a clearly articulated agenda of science and research, the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, let's make a renewed effort to not only about what we're researching and learning about, but how we are putting these results to use. There's real children, real people at stake here, not simply abstractions and "participants in studies"----real individuals, in need of real change, here and today.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241508475805"><id gr:original-id="100 at http://www.baskeptics.org">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4832a133f36836ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics" scheme="http://www.baskeptics.org/category/paranormal/psychics"/><title type="html">Psychic Detective Seeks Money for Nothing</title><published>2009-05-05T07:17:43Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T07:17:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.baskeptics.org/blog/09/05/0100-psychic-detective-seeks-money-nothing" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.baskeptics.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bad-language.com/images/dani_pedlow.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" title="&amp;#39;Psychic&amp;#39; Dani Pedlow"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are still signs posted on telegraph poles throughout the Bay Area, seeking information about missing 8-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Sandra Cantu&lt;/strong&gt; who disappeared from outside her home in &lt;strong&gt;Tracy, CA&lt;/strong&gt;, on March, 27. Tragically, we now know that the little girl was murdered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As reported in &lt;a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/sandra-cantu-case/ci_12265572"&gt;Inside Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;, Los Angeles-based psychic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.danipedlow.com/"&gt;Dani Pedlow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; claims that she assisted Tracy police in solving the case. Pedlow asserts that she predicted the location where the little girl's body would be found. For this supposed assistance, she believes she is entitled to a portion of a $30,000 reward. Pedlow sent a letter to the &lt;strong&gt;Tracy Police Department&lt;/strong&gt;, telling them so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://www.ci.tracy.ca.us/modules/news/article.php?storyid=250"&gt;Tracy Police&lt;/a&gt; deny that Pedlow contacted them for anything more than the reward, "We never reviewed or utilized any information from a psychic during this investigation," Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fortunate, since there is no historical evidence to suggest that &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/psychdet.html"&gt;psychic detectives&lt;/a&gt; have successfully assisted in any case, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they have hindered investigations, and caused additional pain to grieving families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedlow now claims she is being snubbed by the Police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, &lt;a href="http://www.danipedlow.com/announcements/sandracantucase"&gt;Pedlow's press release&lt;/a&gt; claims that she 'saw' the perpetrator, whom she describes as "him". However, Sunday School teacher Melissa Huckaby will stand trial for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Karen Stollznow</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.baskeptics.org/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.baskeptics.org/rss.xml</id><title type="html">Bay Area Skeptics</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.baskeptics.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241506851319"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/triangle_tweetup.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f914f282b4777423</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="North Carolina"/><title type="html">Triangle Tweetup</title><published>2009-05-05T05:49:44Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T05:49:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/YM3lEpe8Gug/triangle_tweetup.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/triangle_tweetup.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/triangle_tweetup_tonight.php" title=""&gt;I went&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23TriangleTweetup" title=""&gt;#TriangleTweetup&lt;/a&gt; last week at &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bronto" title=""&gt;@Bronto&lt;/a&gt;, an Email Service Provider in Durham, NC, with an inflatable brontosaurus as its mascot: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from searching Twitter for TriangleTweetup, you could also follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/triangletweetup" title=""&gt;@triangletweetup&lt;/a&gt; for updates. At one point during the event, the hashtag was 'trending' but I don't know how high it got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were about 250 people there, mostly programers, web developers and PR folks. Reminds me of the old bloggercons. Will tweetups also evolve over the years to attract more people who are using it and less people who are designing it? A first Science Tweetup a few years after the first Science Blogging Conference? Who knows? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="BoraZ191124.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/BoraZ191124.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to talk to as many people as physically possible, but 2 hours are not enough to even shake hands with 250 people, so I relaxed and tried to find people I knew from before, either offline or online. Unlike at blogger meetups where I know so many people already, here I knew (in the sense of "met in real life") only about a dozen people from before, including &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/abelpharmboy" title=""&gt;@abelpharmboy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DPAC" title=""&gt;@DPAC&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="http://dpacspotlight.com/about/" title=""&gt;Rachel Gragg&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GinnySkal" title=""&gt;@GinnySkal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/eronel" title=""&gt;@eronel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/waynesutton" title=""&gt;@waynesutton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dgtlpapercuts" title=""&gt;@dgtlpapercuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/LisaSullivan" title=""&gt;@LisaSullivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/steveburnett" title=""&gt;@steveburnett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jreesnc" title=""&gt;@jreesnc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jacksonfox" title=""&gt;@jacksonfox&lt;/a&gt;, as far as I can remember through the fogs of memory. But, through them, I also met new people, including among others, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/beetweets" title=""&gt;@beetweets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/fullsteam" title=""&gt;@fullsteam&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href="http://www.fullsteam.ag/" title=""&gt;Fullsteam Brewery&lt;/a&gt; serving beer from an interesting contraption, see below), &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/damondnollan" title=""&gt;@damondnollan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mrender" title=""&gt;@mrender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/marynations" title=""&gt;@marynations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/AshleySue" title=""&gt;@AshleySue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lruettimann" title=""&gt;@lruettimann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely missed the panel (it was techie talk anyway, so not really my reason for being there - I am a user and observer) and used my time more wisely to schmooze and meet people and see who does what and tell them what I do, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

To that, I would add: a bigger venue (perhaps DPAC, unless Tweetups are supposed to rotate among the Triangle towns) and the inclusion of Twitter names at registration. I would have so much liked to check people out on Twitter in advance - that way I would have made a special effort to meet some people I discovered only after the event was over due to their post-event tweeting, people I have similar interests with or perhaps potential professional interests. Now I have to wait until the next time. But that is a minor suggestion - the event was great fun. I am looking forward to the next one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/triangle_tweetup.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/YM3lEpe8Gug" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241504308903"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3169">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ca4063cc3e6b139</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="atheists"/><title type="html">An atheist gets outted</title><published>2009-05-05T05:58:52Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T05:58:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/an-atheist-gets-outted/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://everythingelseatheism.blogspot.com/2009/05/i-have-been-outed.html"&gt;Stories like this&lt;/a&gt; remind me why I fight as an atheist activist. Here’s the story of a young woman who has gone to great lengths to hide a huge part of her life from her family, living in actual fear of them one day uncovering the truth, and then suddenly having to deal with the consequences when that secret is exposed. This must be what gay and lesbians often face when being outted. It’s sad that people are forced to live this way because of the inherent divisiveness of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/faith2action-take-lessons-from-answers-in-genesis/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/miULdI-qocg/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only slightly reminiscent of that commercial was the “Gathering Storm” commercial from the anti-gay bigots at the ironically named National Organization for Marriage (I’d link to that video except that its been lost in a sea of parody videos on YouTube.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now the anti-gay bigots over at Faith2Action have come up with an ad that is even more reminiscent of that original Answers in Genesis commercial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/f2a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/f2a.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="146"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I didn’t know better, I’d swear Ray Comfort came up with this one. Even though I have no evidence linking Comfort to this organization, it just stinks of Ray Comfort. Who else could have come up with presenting such a nonsensical argument as if it were a coupon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rather absurd ad that suggests supporting sensible reform to hate crime legislation already on the books means shooting your grandmother illustrates what I’ve been saying for some time now, that the Religious Right has long ago stopped making any sense at all while the media continues to pretend they have a valid argument to keep up the illusion of presenting 2 sides of a controversy even when only one sane position exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this rhetoric about not wanting to change the definition of the word marriage is utter nonsense and every rational thinking human being knows it. Supporting equal rights for human beings is not a liberal position. It’s isn’t even a political position; IT’S THE ONLY POSITION. Just like no one in their right mind would argue that we need to present a political debate in the media over whether or not we should restore slavery, it’s the same deal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anti-gay crap is simply untenable in the modern Western world in the 21st Century. What are we really talking about here anyway? Hate crime legislation. Contray to the spin, this has nothing to do with criminalizing free speech. It’s about violent crime that we already punish in our society. All hate crime legislation means is that if you commit a violent crime against one of the minority groups most likely to be the victims of violent crime for the reason that they belong to that protected group, you will be treated more harshly than if you committed violence against individuals for reasons deemed less deserving of harsher sentences. That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic response from the bigots is typically to point out the double standard of how we don’t have hate crimes for WASPs, for instance. That’s because white people are statistically not very likely to be the victims of violence because they are white. The whole freakin’ point of hate crime legislation is to be an added deterrent to reduce the amount of violent crime committed against groups who are statistically most likely to be attacked because they belong to those groups. It makes no sense to have hate crime legislation specially for white people as statistics show that the deterrents already in place  are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

Actually, I’m not sure if I’ve ever published in an Elsevier journal, although I have reviewed manuscripts for them. In any case, I say that because on Thursday, it was revealed that pharmaceutical company Merck, Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme paid Elsevier to produce a fake medical journal that, to any superficial examination, looked like a real medical journal but was in reality nothing more than advertising for Merck. As reported by &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;amp;o_url=blog/display/55671&amp;amp;id=55671"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck paid an undisclosed sum to Elsevier to produce several volumes of a publication that had the look of a peer-reviewed medical journal, but contained only reprinted or summarized articles–most of which presented data favorable to Merck products–that appeared to act solely as marketing tools with no disclosure of company sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen no shortage of creativity emanating from the marketing departments of drug companies,” Peter Lurie, deputy director of the public health research group at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen, said, after reviewing two issues of the publication obtained by The Scientist. “But even for someone as jaded as me, this is a new wrinkle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which was published by Exerpta Medica, a division of scientific publishing juggernaut Elsevier, is not indexed in the MEDLINE database, and has no website (not even a defunct one). The Scientist obtained two issues of the journal: Volume 2, Issues 1 and 2, both dated 2003. The issues contained little in the way of advertisements apart from ads for Fosamax, a Merck drug for osteoporosis, and Vioxx. (Click &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540001.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540027.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to view PDFs of the two issues.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wrong on so many levels that it’s hard to know where to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that science-based medicine requires to function properly, it’s good science and well-designed clinical trials subjected to rigorous peer review. Moreover, that review has to be unbiased, and the journals publishing them cannot be tainted with undue influence of big pharma. A while back, JAMA editor Catherine DeAngelis was criticized for her crusade against undisclosed conflicts of interest by the authors of journal articles, and, most importantly, her hypocrisy and heavy-handed attempt to slap down a researcher and educator who pointed out the failure of a JAMA author to disclose that he had been on the speakers’ bureau for a pharmaceutical company whose drug he had been studying. What made this offense particularly egregious was that the study in question had a rather glaring methodological flaw that, when corrected for, revealed that nonpharmacological therapy was equal to that of the drug company’s medication, which the author admitted when it was pointed out to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does one do when the whole journal–articles and all–is nothing more than a glossy advertisement for a pharmaceutical company’s products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, if there’s one thing most physicians and scientists know, it’s that there are &lt;a href="http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/155/4/889.pdf"&gt;numerous “throwaway” journals&lt;/a&gt; out there. “Throwaway” journals tend to be defined as journals that are provided free of charge, have a lot of advertising (a high “advertising-to-text” ratio, as it is often described), and contain no original investigations. Other relevant characteristics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported virtually entirely by advertising revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ads tend to be placed within article pages interrupting the articles, rather than between articles, as is the case with most medical journals that accept ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually the entire content is reviews of existing content of variable (and often dubious) quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parasitic. Throwaways often summarize peer-reviewed research from real journals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questionable (at best) peer review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwaways tend to cater to an uninvolved and uncritical readership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No original work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwaway journals are rarely or never cited in the medical literature and virtually never indexed in PubMed. They also tend to have names like, well, &lt;em&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.  However, as advertisement-packed as throwaway journals tend to be, they are actually fairly widely read–indeed as much or more so than some peer-reviewed journals. The reason, most likely, is because they tend to publish short, easily digestible review articles, perfect for busy clinicians, particularly in private practice. Moreover, as reported in this &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/287/21/2853.pdf"&gt;JAMA article&lt;/a&gt; (ironically enough), despite their lesser scientific rigor, throwaway journals have many aspects that are appealing to clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean (SD) quality scores were highest for peer-reviewed articles (0.94 [0.09] for systematic reviews and 0.30 [0.19] for nonsystematic reviews) compared with throwaway journal articles (0.23 [0.03], F2,391=280.8, P .001). Throwaway journal articles used more tables (P=.02), figures (P=.01), photographs (P .001), color (P .001), and larger font sizes (P .001) compared with peer-reviewed articles. Readability scores were more often in the college or higher range for peer-reviewed journals compared with the throwaway journal articles (104 [77.0%] vs 156 [64.2%]; P=.01). Peer-reviewed article titles were judged less relevant to clinical practice than throwaway journal article titles (P .001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, throwaway journals tend to be to peer-reviewed journals a lot like &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; is to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. However, in general, they are not blatantly written by pharmaceutical companies, as apparently was the case with the Merck journal. (Yes, I’m going to refer to it as that. After all, that’s accurate.) Moreover, in general doctors are well aware of throwaway journals and that they aren’t meant to be taken as seriously as real journals. (If they were, they wouldn’t be delivered free to their offices, sometimes whether they want them or not, after all.) Rather, doctors tend use them as shortcuts for digesting information quickly or not to rad them at all. (There’s a reason they’re called “throwaway” journals.) They also realize that they are completely advertising-supported. In essence, any conflicts of interest are pretty well right out there in the form of numerous ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effort by Merck took it far, far &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;amp;o_url=blog/display/55671&amp;amp;id=55671"&gt;beyond the throwaway journal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to several questions about the publication posed by The Scientist, an MSDA spokesperson wrote in an email: “MSDA understood that Elsevier envisaged the complimentary publication would draw on the vast resources of Elsevier, publishers of many leading peer-reviewed journals including Lancet, Bone, Joint Bone Spine and others, to deliver novel and timely full text articles and abstracts to physicians.” Many of the articles appearing in the &lt;em&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/em&gt; were in fact reprints or summaries of studies that originally appeared in other Elsevier journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that excuses the deception. Of course, they must have been reprints of articles that appeared in other Elsevier journals! Otherwise, Elsevier wouldn’t have had the rights to publish them! It’s not necessarily the quality of the reprinted articles that’s an issue. It’s their packaging in a pseudojournal that’s nothing more than an advertising vehicle for Merck without any disclosure that that’s what the purpose of the journal was! Elsevier’s got some ’splainin’ to do, as they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Elsevier acknowledges the concern that the journals in question didn’t have the appropriate disclosures,” the statement continued. “It is worth noting that project in question was produced 6 years ago and disclosure protocols have evolved since 2003. Elsevier’s current disclosure policies meet the rigor and requirements of the current publishing environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elsevier spokesperson said the company wasn’t aware of how many copies of the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine were produced or how the publication was distributed in Australia, but noted that “the common practice for sponsored journals is that doctors receive them complimentary.” The spokesperson added that Elsevier had no plans to look further into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in other words, we don’t do it anymore; so it’s not a big deal. Of course, Elsevier also publishes the pseudoscientific journal &lt;a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/623042/description#description"&gt;Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; (after all, homeopathy is quackery, period), a fair number of “integrative medicine” journals, and the highly dubious journal &lt;a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/623042/description#description"&gt;Explore&lt;/a&gt;, which regularly publishes Dean Radin’s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php"&gt;pseudoscientific articles&lt;/a&gt; on “distant healing” and food imbued with “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/dr_emotos_water_woo_metastasizes.php"&gt;intent&lt;/a&gt;.” So you’ll excuse me if I don’t take Elsevier’s hilarious “&lt;a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/intro.cws_home/ethical_guidelines"&gt;code of ethics&lt;/a&gt;” seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsevier takes its duties of guardianship over the scholarly record very seriously. Our journal programs record “the minutes of science” and we recognize our responsibilities as the keeper of those “minutes” in all our policies, including the guidelines we have adopted to support editors, reviewers and authors in performing their ethical duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, apparently, when it comes to pharma-supported advertising efforts and the publication of quack journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Merck and Elsevier couldn’t do this alone. They needed help. Depressingly, they got it from the very people who should know enough to “just say no” to such blatant marketing ploys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the members of &lt;em&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/em&gt;’s “Honorary Editorial Board,” Peter Brooks, a rheumatologist in Australia, said he didn’t recall who asked him to serve on the board, but noted that he was on Merck’s Asian Pacific and international advisory boards from the mid 1990s until about 2004, as well as the advisory boards of other pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Amgen. “You get involved in a whole bunch of things at this level,” Brooks said, adding that he had put his name on “a few advertorials” for pharmaceutical companies about 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dr. Brooks’ excuse seems to be carelessness. The answer, of course, is for physicians to refuse to “get involved in a whole bunch of things at this level.” He also claims ignorance, namely that he didn’t know that the journal was nothing more than an advertising ploy for big pharma. That, I suppose, is possible, but surely he actually looked at the journal on whose editorial board he had agreed to serve. Surely he must have wondered when, after being on the editorial board, he wasn’t ever actually asked to do anything, such as review a submission–or even solicit a review article. Apparently he did not, even though serving on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; editorial board is generally a large amount of work. Not having any work to do on an editorial board should have been a huge red flag that tipped him that this journal wasn’t a “real” journal. So should the fact that it was listed as an “Honorary Editorial Board.” (I wonder if he put that on his CV.) Moreover, one wonders what he did when he ultimately found out. Apparently nothing, other than to deny that it was a marketing journal. Never mind that there were review articles and even an article labeled as a “meta-analysis” that only listed one or two references. Usually reviews list numerous references that were used as the source material for the review; even more importantly, you can’t do a “meta-analysis” on one or two studies. Such articles should have been even more obvious red flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors like Dr. Brooks are every bit as guilty as Merck and Elsevier for deceptive pharma marketing like this. We physicians are supposed to represent the best interests of our patients, and, as far as I’m concerned, to defend science-based medicine. Our credibility depends upon it. Being accomplices to those using deceptive marketing practices such as this not only undermines our credibility and betrays our patients, but it provides an opening for purveyors of unscientific medicine and outright quackery to paint us as hopelessly corrupt. Pharmaceutical companies have ample resources for advertising their wares. We shouldn’t be so willing to give them such cheap access to our credibility and respect as physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

The phrases are much more common now than they were in the old media, mostly because the new media have dramatically increased the opportunities for self-exposure — Google Blogsearch alone turns up more than 4000 hits for the phrases. The vast majority of these are associated with creative works and activities, in a broad sense of the term: people apologize for shamelessly touting their books, TV appearances, t-shirt designs, videos, high-school band performances, blogs, and new CD&amp;#39;s. (Others apologize for shamelessly plugging their hairdresser or a PC they have for sale on Ebay, which seems to me a little unclear on the concept — what&amp;#39;s to be ashamed of?)  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Years-Talking-Dangerously-Geoff-Nunberg/dp/1586487450/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1241228071&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;img style="border:0px solid black;margin-top:7px;margin-bottom:7px;margin-left:4px;margin-right:13px;float:left" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/yotd2.jpg" alt="YOTD" width="159" height="226"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modifier accomplishes several things at once: it concedes that the self-promotion is an impropriety, but one venial enough to be joked about; and it averts the reader's censure with preemptive self-reproach. It reminds me of the way H. W. Fowler described the use of apologies like "saving the reader's reverence" and "if we may adopt the current slang":  "A refinement on the institution of the whipping boy, by which [writers] not only have the boy, but do the whipping."&lt;/p&gt;

It goes without saying, shouting fire in the event of an actual fire would never be a cause for punishment.  It appears that shouting fire while holding a mistaken belief that there was a fire, a terrible and possibly lethal error, would likely be no cause for punishment, either.  But what if that belief was based on no good evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shipowner was about to send to sea an emigrant-ship. He knew that she was old, and not overwell built at the first; that she had seen many seas and climes, and often had needed repairs. Doubts had been suggested to him that possibly she was not seaworthy. These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made him unhappy; he thought that perhaps he ought to have her thoroughly overhauled and refitted, even though this should put him at great expense. Before the ship sailed, however, he succeeded in overcoming these melancholy reflections. He said to himself that she had gone safely through so many voyages and weathered so many storms that it was idle to suppose she would not come safely home from this trip also. He would put his trust in Providence, which could hardly fail to protect all these unhappy families that were leaving their fatherland to seek for better times elsewhere. He would dismiss from his mind all ungenerous suspicions about the honesty of builders and contractors. In such ways he acquired a sincere and comfortable conviction that his vessel was thoroughly safe and seaworthy; he watched her departure with a light heart, and benevolent wishes for the success of the exiles in their strange new home that was to be; and he got his insurance-money when she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/evangelicals-undermine-the-war-in-afghanistan/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/hVGmbzDLq5c/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is incredibly destructive to what we’re trying to do over there and is a clear violation of the military’s code of conduct. This is unacceptable. And Afghans also take issue with the Christian evangelism that accompanies the U.S. soldiers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one recorded sermon, Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Hensley, the chief of the US military chaplains in Afghanistan, tells soldiers that, as followers of Jesus Christ, they all have a responsibility “to be witnesses for him”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The special forces guys - they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That’s what we do, that’s our business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as this continues we will never succeed in Afghanistan and it’s just a doomed operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh, good, Oprah is going to give Jenny McCarthy a talk show, because she &lt;em&gt;wants your kid to die of the measles&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;McCarthy, a famous celebrity from the long-defunct Playboy magazine and much missed MTV channel, has been on a crusade to find an evildoer responsible for her son's autism. She settled on vaccines, because why not. And now she spends a great deal of time on TV explaining that the mercury that has not been vaccines since 1999 is giving all the kids autism, but it can be cured with Chelation therapy, which has so far only killed one or two autistic kids, so good on you, Jenny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So famous TV empress Oprah Winfrey signed Jenny to a multi-year multi-platform deal that will include a syndicated talk show. The show will be called "Finding Someone to Blame When Bad Things Happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I could quibble that mercury-containing thimerosal was removed, aside from trace amounts, from childhood vaccines other than the flu vaccine by the end of 2001, not in 1999 (which was the year when the AAP and CDC recommended the removal of thimerosal, a decision that took a couple of years to come to full fruition), but I agree with the sentiment. It is all about blame and the need to blame something--&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;--for autism. That's what Jenny McCarthy is all about, and she's used it to propel herself to the point of having a shot at Dr. Phil or Rachel Ray territory. Truly, she has ridden the autism and vaccine quackery horse back from New Age Indigo woo to fame and fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Oprah is about to catapult her to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, when celebrity gossip rags start ragging on you for supporting antivaccine lunacy, you know you have a problem. Oprah has a problem. Not that Oprah cares. She's rich, and she's Oprah. Why on earth &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; she care if more kids become ill from vaccine-preventable diseases and if some of them even die because she gave a platform to an anti-vaccine loon like Jenny McCarthy to spread her poison about vaccines and frighten parents with pseudoscience, misinformation, and lies? There's money to be made! And if there's one thing Oprah is very, very good at, it's making money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the price is a few more dead kids, well what are a few more--or even many more--dead kids to her? She's Oprah, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been at this for four years; I'm made of pretty stern stuff, although I will admit that the union of Jenny and Oprah did test my mettle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/the_best_snark_at_oprah_winfrey.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Yg4FCM3AUSM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241498139557"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3158">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fee4b3ba7bd9b48c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><category term="Oprah"/><category term="The Doctors"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">Unholy Alliance</title><published>2009-05-05T04:31:06Z</published><updated>2009-05-05T04:31:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/unholy-alliance/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/photos/uncategorized/2009/05/04/mccarthyoprah_l.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://popwatch.ew.com/photos/uncategorized/2009/05/04/mccarthyoprah_l.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="166"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This might be the most depressing news I’ve heard all year. &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5239636/oprah-joins-list-of-celebs-enabling-jenny-mccarthys-conspiracy-crusade"&gt;Jenny McCarthy has joined forces with Oprah&lt;/a&gt;.

And unfortunately, the Oprah staff doesn’t care how many angry letters they receive. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-03/030207harpo.html#i1"&gt;They will just keep promoting pseudoscience because they don’t care about truth&lt;/a&gt;. This means that those promoting good science are going to have to work well beyond twice as hard to get our message out there, which further means much those of us at Stop &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; are going to be working our asses off this year to dispell the myths Jenny perpetuates. Please if you can, promote the site as well as &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt;. Jenny is also going to be &lt;a href="http://www.thedoctorstv.com/main/show_page/198"&gt;popping up on &lt;em&gt;The Doctors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the next few days, but I hold out little hope that this issue will be treated like anything more than your typical manufactured controversy for ratings given that that’s what happened the last time they did an episode on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

It often seems like every conspiracy nut eventually comes around to making some sort of extraordinary and unfalsifiable accusation against pharmaceutical companies like Merck. And usually those conspiracies can be dismissed rather quickly because as Christopher Hitchens says, what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. And of course pretty much every time I refute these claims, those with an emotional attachment to their own anti-pharmaceutical beliefs accuse me of being a shill for “Big Pharma” because they arrogantly hold the view that anyone who disagrees with them is either an uninformed “sheeple” or a shill for “Big Pharma.” For them, no other possibility exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well today, I’m doing something a little different because unfortunately just because pharmaceutical companies aren’t poisoning everyone as part of an evil eugenics scheme hatched by the “New World Order” doesn’t mean they’re any more honest than any other corporation. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/when_big_pharma_pays_a_publisher_to_publ.php#more"&gt;While Merck isn’t turning any kids autistic, they have been caught red-handed committing fraud&lt;/a&gt; by&lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;amp;o_url=blog/display/55671&amp;amp;id=55671"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck paid an undisclosed sum to Elsevier to produce several volumes of a publication that had the look of a peer-reviewed medical journal, but contained only reprinted or summarized articles–most of which presented data favorable to Merck products–that appeared to act solely as marketing tools with no disclosure of company sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the bogus publication is the&lt;em&gt; Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; The real tragedy here goes beyond whatever direct harm might have been caused in the short-term but is how this isolated incident will inevitably be exploited as a propaganda tool by “Alternative” “Medicine” practitioners to sell their own snake oil. This will be used as yet another example of how “Big Pharma” lies and cheats to make profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, like when Creationists bring up the infamous Piltdown Man hoax, the propaganda will conveniently ignore the fact that it was the very system of science, which is designed to successfully weed out such fraud, that exposed this corruption. That’s why Carl Sagan said Science delivers the goods. While pseudoscience has no mechanism in place to expose fraud, the scientific process does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why the true focus of this story should be how scientific investigation prevailed rather than how some capitalistic corporation that happens to make medical products defrauded the public.&lt;/p&gt;

Now there is an excellent  movie from Singapore entitled "Mad about English."  Here I provide a trailer for the movie and a clip of a phenomenal policeman featured in the film who not only can say "Welcome to Beijing" in more languages than I can count, but who also can talk like a New York gangster.  First the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9VGJ30s3pw"&gt;multilingual cop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBFEgMqhOs4"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Lian Pek, the director of &amp;quot;Mad about English,&amp;quot; in Singapore, and she told me that not a single actor in the film was a professional.  Moreover, none of the scenes were rehearsed, so the movie has an amazing sense of verisimilitude.  I brought the whole film back with me on a DVD and watched it together with my wife last weekend.  Li-ching was so rapt by the unrehearsed performances of the nonprofessional actors that she stood throughout the whole one and a half hours — one moment convulsed with laughter, the next weeping with empathy as the taxi driver, the old Chinese doctor, the little girl, the salespersons, and other Beijing citizens earnestly struggled to wrap their mouths, tongues, and throats around English with all of its complicated consonants and vowels.  As for me, I was glued to my seat two feet from the TV screen, totally mesmerized by so much lovable earnestness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241480441208"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_words_run_out_theres_some_other_stuff">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c7dd0ac088739a8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">When the Words Run Out (There's Some Other Stuff)</title><published>2009-05-04T23:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T23:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_words_run_out_theres_some_other_stuff" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quiero-un-pantano/322122502/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/322122502_467bf4a746_m.jpg" alt="abstract image of red smoke in gestural, dancing forms" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm (well, OK, perhaps this is open to debate) a pretty skilled writer.  I wasn't born that way though; I've studied.  And practiced.  A lot.  I've worked hard; made communication with words a priority.  To someone who reads this blog, it probably looks like the words just flow out every day, and, well, sometimes they do, but there's a lot that goes unseen too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been writing pretty much non-stop for a week and a half.  I've had to prepare two public testimonies for state hearings.  I had the honor and privilege of being asked to present on one of my favorite topics, augmentative and alternative communication, to the IACC.  I've been working on grant proposals for my research group.  Extra lots of work means extra stress means I rely more and more on my keyboard and notepad for my communication, which means more writing, typing, writing--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it may look though, words really don't come easily to me.  Words are non-native to my thinking.  They are the flattened, translated, always-less-that-accurate shadows of what I truly want to express.  Words come more easily than they once did, but they are still hard work.  Hard work that no one sees from the other side of the Internet from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, at this point, pretty much all word-ed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a reminder: not all communication happens in words.  Nor is all communication best served through words.  Some alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gesture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent idiosyncratic behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facial expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-speech utterances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual arts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal visual languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more--what else?--but this is where I run the rest of the way out of words--&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7387037.stm"&gt;the most disasterous cyclone-hit in recent times&lt;/a&gt;. Over 140,000 people have been confirmed dead with tens of thousands more missing and millions rendered homeless, mostly in the low lying Irrawaddy delta region on the Burmese coast, where &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8030211.stm"&gt;even one year on&lt;/a&gt;, survivors are facing deficits of foot, water, shelter and sanitation, and the UN have only recently been granted significant access. The damage was done not by the winds of "Cyclone Nargis" however, but by a tidal surge more than ten feet high that swept across the land. It's tempting to attribute such disasters to bad luck, but in fact this was at least partly preventable, and scientists explained exactly why in 2005 in the research that I'll show you now for my first regular post at &lt;a href="http://worldismycountry.org"&gt;worldismycountry.org&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;Dahdouhguebas et al's "How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami?"&lt;/i&gt; [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/01/paleontologists_behaving_badly.php"&gt;Aetogate&lt;/a&gt; on the VRTPALEO list are just one notable example, but email lists and blogs also host discussions in the wake of retractions of journal papers, investigations of allegations of scientific misconduct, and other sorts of professional shenanigans.  While some of the people in these conversations cloak their identities in pseudonyms, others use their real names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How identifiable one is while participating in these discussions becomes an issue sometimes because there is pushback.  We saw some examples of pushback in Aetogate.  In one case, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/02/how_committed_are_paleontologi.php"&gt;an "independent" member of an inquiry panel&lt;/a&gt; characterized the people who had raised the concerns which the inquiry was supposed to investigate as "mainly young, un- or under-employed workers (including both Park and Martz)" with an axe to grind.  In another, a scientist posted to the VRTPALEO list (under his own name) to do some &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/02/way_to_represent_your_professi.php"&gt;heavy-duty victim blaming&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to put some fear into the young upstarts raising a ruckus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will these actions result in outrage in the paleontological community, ruination of careers, civil proceedings, etc.? I hope not. 

&lt;p&gt;You better hope that the harm done doesn't also include your own career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate student(s), do you honestly think that raising a lot of hell when you are looking for employment is really going to help your career? You must not work in the same niche of academia that I inhabit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advisors, as you might well imagine, are concerned when their trainees get involved in highly visible discussions of controversial conduct.  One of my correspondents received a cautionary email along these lines:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/what_to_do_when_the_boss_says.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/what_to_do_when_the_boss_says.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/G4Ps81JQpKw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241475258415"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/get-cool-stuff-and-help-someone-get-to-tam-7/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f51e7878e7a0490</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Get cool stuff and help someone get to TAM 7</title><published>2009-05-04T22:00:49Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T22:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/get-cool-stuff-and-help-someone-get-to-tam-7/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ng Meeting&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes called &amp;quot;The Woodstock of Skepticism&amp;quot;, a comparison with which I agree. It’s a fantastic event for the critical thinking community, where like-minded folks get together and hear from some of the leaders in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not free to attend, though, and that means some people who’d like to come can’t. To help alleviate that situation a little, people on James Randi’s bulletin board throw an auction every year, and the proceeds go to a &amp;quot;scholarship&amp;quot; of sorts for people who need a little economic boost to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/forumdisplay.php?f=67"&gt;The auction items for TAM 7 are on the board now&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re pretty cool: &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=141831"&gt;be immortalized in Richard Wiseman’s book&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=141811"&gt;Eat lunch with the Skepchicks (and Sam)&lt;/a&gt;! I have it on good authority that more auctions will be forthcoming, so bookmark the page and start bidding. Hurry! The auctions end in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the Secular Student Alliance, another worthy organization, is looking for donations for their own conference in August. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/20/why-you-should-help-the-secular-student-movement/"&gt;Hemant Mehta at The Friendly Atheist has the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This proved to be  a fascinating experience for a young man who had lived in large cities all his life. But it actually made me a good field interviewer because I knew nothing about farming and other aspects of rural life and this ignorance actually legitimized my rather mundane questions about such things as what the farmers called the utensil they use to fry eggs with, the machinery they use  to reap their harvests, and what  they call their animals. I haven’t done linguistic geography since those halcyon days, but this New York Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/opinion/03freedman.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the controversy over FCC’s crackdown &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122575539538895001.html"&gt;(the Bono Rule)&lt;/a&gt; on the use of dirty words brought back some fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article quoted prominent lexicographer, Jesse Sheidlower, who calmly identified as “rubbish” the FCC’s 2007 ruling that one particular word (you can guess which word they meant) invariably evokes a coarse sexual image. Jesse argued that although this word originally referred to a sexual act, it has now taken on an independent emotional nonsexual sense, shown by the example of Vice President Dick Cheney’s admonition that Senator Patrick Leahy could go commit an anatomically impossible act.  The referential function of that word has simply changed, which seems to be hard for many to comprehend.  They ought to read Chris Potts’ Language Log &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=808"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on expressives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me get back to my Illinois dialect research. When I asked the old farmers what they called the male species of bovine animal, I made good use of my city-bred ignorance by phasing my question, “What do you call a male cow?” That always brought a smile, along with a bit of sympathy for my ignorance. But it yielded a good answer anyway, which was as likely to be “gentleman cow” as “bull.” The Victorian era lingered in the minds of the “gentleman cow” speakers, along with “white meat” for the  breast of chickens, “cut” or “alter” for castrate, and other delicate verbal detours around anything that even hinted of things sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescriptivism is alive and well at the FCC, and Justice Scalia firmly asserts that the taboo word most in contention “invariably invokes a coarse sexual image.” I suppose he might argue the same for “bull,” “chicken breast” and “castrate.” Too strong for mixed company.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241473492001"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-3444516842550795014">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f68d497d0a86a1b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pareidolia" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Pareidolia: n + 18</title><published>2009-05-04T21:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T21:44:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/05/pareidolia-n-18.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/3444516842550795014/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=3444516842550795014&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Apparently fried junk food must be among the favorite foods for divine beings.

&lt;p&gt;Sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sniffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are sounds of a cold---sounds no one is glad to hear themselves making. When I hear Charlie making these sounds, and rubbing away at his nose, and sniffling, and realize he's not talking as much as he usually does---worry sets in. Charlie's not able to verbalize how he's feeling so it's pretty much a guessing game for Jim and me about what he might have. More often than not, we find ourselves calling the pediatrician's office; as Charlie's been going there for many years, they always give us a same-day appointment and a sympathetic ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've started to figure out what might be ailing Charlie (who actually had a cold/allergy thing this past weekend---slept past 2pm on Saturday), Jim and I have been faced with another quandary: Who's going to take off from work and stay home? While we try to set up our teaching and work schedules so someone can always be home, unexpected meetings, appointments, and other obligations always arise and (as our only babysitters--my parents---live 3000 miles away in California and Charlie's not going to time when he gets sick to their visits, as if he should!), and one of us inevitably has to cancel classes/meetings/etc.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been commiserating in buckets with the parents of students at Public School 177 in Queens which, as reported in today's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/nyregion/04bigcity.html?ref=nyregion"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, has been shut down last week after some five cases of &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/index.html#2009"&gt;H1N1&lt;/a&gt; aka swine flu were reported. Some 500 of PS 177's students are in special education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a last-minute sitter is a challenge for any working parent; finding one for children with special needs is a near impossibility. Caroline Breuers, the president of P.S. 177’s Parent-Teacher Association, said she had heard that many of the respite workers who ordinarily assist families when school is out were reluctant to come last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with special needs, like one with autism, does fall ill, that poses unique difficulties. Many of P.S. 177’s students are nonverbal, so teachers have learned to be resourceful if they sense someone’s behavior has taken a turn for the worse. A child who cannot say his stomach hurts might be able to point at a picture of a stomach. A child with a headache “might start banging his head, because he thinks that will make the pain go away,” Ms. Posa said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses can be a challenge: Good luck to doctors trying to get a throat culture from a child with severe sensory issues, like Regina Oldenburg’s 12-year-old son, who attends P.S. 177. Was it strep? Was it a virus? “You’ll never figure it out,” said Ms. Oldenburg. “It would be wonderful to know these things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Charlie has had a throat culture taken (for strep; came back negative). Yes, my son does bang his head and we have connected this to him having various pains in various other parts of his body and trying (we think) to signal this to us----we're always wary of making generalizations about this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can agree with: Life raising a child with a disability does mean that, as a parent, you get used to the unexpected falling into your lap. And, due to the pervasive lack of sitters (and teachers, therapists, etc., etc.) for kids "who need more," you are already used to having to drop everything and head home to take care of your child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while it can make things a bit complicated at work, we're always glad for extra time with Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241469467520"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4302881731938390502">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bed15ec1fa5cd479</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A Letter to the Editor on the Posting of the Ten Commandments</title><published>2009-05-04T17:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T18:25:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/DYNceTzReXw/letter-to-editor-on-posting-of-ten.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4302881731938390502/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4302881731938390502" title="31 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/05/letter-to-editor-on-posting-of-ten.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Someone posted the &lt;em&gt;Ten Commandments &lt;/em&gt;in a prominent place on his own property in our area. He was subsequently described as "courageous" in a letter to the editor. This is my brief response:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take courage to post the Ten Commandments on private property, as one person recently commented. That’s a right guaranteed by the first amendment which most people enthusiastically support and defend, including me. I wonder though, if this is the symbol Christian people really want to display to reflect their beliefs? There are three versions of the Ten Commandments, which were based to some degree on the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 1795 – 1750 BC), and they don’t all agree with each other (Exodus 20; Exodus 34; Deuteronomy 4). Which one do you post?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only commandments relevant to American law are the ones prohibiting homicide, theft and perjury, which are laws almost everyone wants enforced, for good reasons. Who, for instance, in our day wants to prosecute people for worshipping a different god, making a graven image of him, working on the Saturday Sabbath day, taking the Lord’s name in vain, not honoring their parents, committing adultery, or coveting another person’s property? We all know what happened when such laws were enforced by the church, now don’t we? We live in a democracy, not a theocracy, and for good reasons. The last one about not coveting reflects the ancient barbaric practice of a thought police, something which is still being enforced in some Muslim countries where people can be prosecuted for what they think! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, what about some other commandments that aren’t listed but could be, like: “Thou shalt not own slaves or beat them,” “Thou shalt not treat people differently because of the color of their skin,” “Thou shalt not beat thy wife,” “Thou shalt not rape women, or commit incest with children,” “Thou shalt not kill or torture heretics or witches,” “Thou shalt not conduct Holy Wars,” or “Thou shalt not trap or abuse animals but treat them humanely.” I think those additions would’ve been very helpful down through the ages, don’t you? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if we regard the Ten Commandments as moral rules, aren’t they too restrictive? Is there any room for mitigating circumstances or exceptions? The history of ethical thinking reveals there are a great many exceptions to straightforward commands such as these. Is religious art a graven image to avoid? Should we always honor or obey our parents in everything, even if one tells us to do wrong or who molests us? One commandment states we should not kill, yet we see plenty of divinely sanctioned killings in the Bible, even genocide. Should we always tell the truth under all circumstances? I think not, and so do many religious people. I just think better symbols are available, that’s all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4302881731938390502?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

No? Oh, you’re funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like there reactions to the H1N1 fall into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holy shit! Panic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut up already. Who cares?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a survey on the Chicago Tribune website that asked, Are you worried about swine flu? And the options were yes or no. I thought that was a little unfair. Isn’t there a middle ground? A point where we take it seriously but not freak the fuck out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your take on the H1N1? Are you freaking out? Are you telling people to shut the hell up? Are you at least washing your hands? Or are you coughing and sneezing into people’s drinks and wiping your boogers on old people and cancer patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241463820566"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/trackbacks_-_the_hows_and_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/757ffd981b43e165</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="PLoS"/><title type="html">Trackbacks - the hows and the whys - on PLoS journals' articles</title><published>2009-05-04T19:13:07Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T19:13:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/vamhSY7Otb0/trackbacks_-_the_hows_and_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/trackbacks_-_the_hows_and_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just read it &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/04/the-how-and-why-of-trackbacks/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, then bookmark it for the next time you write a blog post about a PLoS paper...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/trackbacks_-_the_hows_and_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/vamhSY7Otb0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241463820565"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/todays_carnivals_365.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/843cc6ec00cd2124</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-05-04T18:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T18:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/PeUhKMFktz0/todays_carnivals_365.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/todays_carnivals_365.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientia Pro Publica 3: the Swine 'flu Edition is up on &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/boboh/blog/2009/05/04/scientia-pro-publica-3-the-swine-flu-edition" title=""&gt;Deep Thoughts and Silliness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7387037.stm"&gt;the most disasterous cyclone-hit in recent times&lt;/a&gt;. Over 140,000 people have been confirmed dead with tens of thousands more missing and millions rendered homeless, mostly in the low lying Irrawaddy delta region on the Burmese coast, where &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8030211.stm"&gt;even one year on&lt;/a&gt;, survivors are facing deficits of foot, water, shelter and sanitation, and the UN have only recently been granted significant access. The damage was done not by the winds of "Cyclone Nargis" however, but by a tidal surge more than ten feet high that swept across the land. It's tempting to attribute such disasters to bad luck, but in fact this was at least partly preventable, and scientists explained exactly why in 2005 in the research that I'll show you now for my first regular post at &lt;a href="http://worldismycountry.org"&gt;worldismycountry.org&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;i&gt;Dahdouhguebas et al's "How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami?"&lt;/i&gt; [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now she’s gone way, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too far: &lt;a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/tvguide/405830_tvgif4.html"&gt;she’s signed Jenny McCarthy — notorious for her misleading statements about vaccines and autism — on for a multi-platform deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy has advocated a link between autism and vaccinations for years. She has written and spoken about it at length in very large venues like Oprah’s and Larry King’s shows, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=444"&gt;but her claims are wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, they’re dangerous: by claiming vaccines are dangerous, she is scaring parents into delaying or even preventing their children from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this threat to the health of our children can be overstated: we have already seen a dramatic rise in outbreaks in preventable diseases due to the rise in media presence of antivax claptrap, and there have been deaths of children, &lt;em&gt;deaths of babies&lt;/em&gt;, because of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Oprah is giving the premier mouthpiece for this movement a huge loudspeaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of this couldn’t be more ironic, with Australian TV slamming the antivax movement due to the death of a four-week-old infant girl from whooping cough — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/antivax-kills/"&gt;a death directly related to the antivaxxers in Australia&lt;/a&gt; — with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;a growing response&lt;/a&gt; online to the distortions and outright lies of the antivaxxers here in the U.S, and with &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE5421R020090504"&gt;antiscience knee-jerking exacerbating the global reaction to swine flu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah: you have screwed up on this one, and in a huge, huge way. Jenny McCarthy has loudly and publicly increased fears over vaccinations based on nonsense and bad science. By giving her a platform, you are virtually guaranteeing that vaccination rates will decline further, there will be more outbreaks of easily preventable diseases, and therefore we’ll see an increase in deaths of children all around the world.

This tendency for scientists to coagulate is most prevalent in experimentalists and observers, and in those of us who have reached scientific middle age (i.e. the Committee Era).  However, scientists’ education and apprenticeship includes little explicit training to prepare us for functioning within such groups — or, gawd forbid, managing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, I read the business section of the paper.  The business community is all about “working together to reach a common goal”, and they have an awful lot of experience in harnessing the energies of large groups of people.  It’s by no means a perfect one-to-one map, as science tends to be much less hierarchical and formalized.  However, there are insights to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was quite taken &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/19corner.html"&gt;by an interview&lt;/a&gt; with business leader Nell Minow, who became a parent during the time that she was transitioning to management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first became a professional manager, I was pregnant for the first time, and so I grew up with both responsibilities at the same time. You have people saying the same two things to you all day long, which is, “Look what I did.” And you say: “It’s really good. Do some more.” Or they say, “He took my stuff.” And you have to say, “Tell him to give it back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re constantly trying, whether you’re raising children or dealing with employees, to get them to take responsibility for their own issues. I’m not saying that in a maternalistic way, just in a way of trying to get people to take responsibility for themselves, to do the best that they can and to learn as much as they can. In both cases, you’re trying to make people more independent and bring them along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this to be an incredibly succinct statement of what the best scientific mentorship looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the next week was followed by what appears to be the anti-Nell Minow.  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/business/26corner.html?em"&gt;The interview begins&lt;/a&gt; with the CEO of Delta describing his management revelation that it wasn’t all that helpful to lose your temper at work (you think?).  But what got me riled up was part of his description of how he evaluates job candidates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What other questions do you ask?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; You want to know about their family. Where they grew up. What their parents did. Where they went to high school. What their avocations were. How many kids they had in their family. You know, what their whole background and history is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that from a C.E.O. I worked for. The C.E.O. wouldn’t really spend that much time on the résumé, but spent most of the time wanting to know everything about the person’s life, family, what they liked, where they liked to go on vacation, what their kids were like. And it gave you a really good perspective about who they were as people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whooo boy.  If this isn’t a recipe for overlooking Talent that Doesn’t Look Like You, I don’t know what is.  Suppose the candidate is a polyamorous gay man who was raised in a circus, but happens to be a whiz at selling widgets to the masses.  Or heck, is a run of the mill single mom.  Now, maybe I’m not giving him enough of a benefit of the doubt, as he may indeed be looking for a holistic view of the candidate’s motivations (”Polyamorous? Raised in a circus?  Sounds like he’d be flexible and good at managing change!”).  But, I can’t help but think his focus on intangibles over resume might reflect some attitudes that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/"&gt;Zuska&lt;/a&gt; would consider worthy of shoe-puking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day the two great leaders will become friends,&lt;br&gt;
Their great power will be seen to increase:&lt;br&gt;
The new land will be at the height of its power,&lt;br&gt;
To the bloody one the numbers are reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day has come. All-powerful bullshit billboard Oprah Winfrey &lt;a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/05/jenny-mccarthy.html"&gt;has just inked a deal&lt;/a&gt; with anti-vaccination lunatic Jenny McCarthy to create a monster of epic proportions. One can assume that Jenny is one of Nostradamus’ “two great leaders” as well as “the bloody one,” considering her already-too-large audience and her apparent joy at encouraging people to put their children at risk of death &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com"&gt;(see her current body count here)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah previously foisted Dr. Phil and his facial hair upon an unsuspecting nation, so clearly she’s demented enough to make this happen and there’s probably not a damn thing we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, okay, let’s try to be a little optimistic here. One thing you can do is &lt;strong&gt;warn your mother&lt;/strong&gt;. I don’t know about you, but my mom is right in Oprah’s audience sweet spot: newly retired and possessing a kind of warm affection for Oprah and anything Oprah recommends. Therefore, our best bet may be to head this one off at the pass by sending a short, informative email to our mothers. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how much you enjoy Oprah, and I also know how much you enjoy children not dying. That’s why I’m sending you a quick heads-up that Oprah is about to make a big mistake by giving a lot of money and publicity to a terrible person: Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model who is trying to convince people not to vaccinate their children because she mistakenly thinks vaccines are harmful. Her actions have directly led to injuries, deaths, and the spread of diseases like measles that were previously considered to be eradicated in the United States thanks to the vaccination program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to avoid McCarthy’s new ventures and maybe even let Oprah know how you feel about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;br&gt;
Your loving daughter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this will be more effective than writing your own letter to Oprah. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=407"&gt;I tried it ages ago&lt;/a&gt; and apparently it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241458098707"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=10471">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0ca09fb2c37e3a81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="horse racing"/><category term="predictions"/><title type="html">Thankfully, No One Pays Attention</title><published>2009-05-04T17:12:17Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T17:12:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/Yo82I3RZPbc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/thankfully-no-one-pays-attention/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Thankfully, no one pays attention to my annual Kentucky Derby picks, because if they did, they would have read this prediction that I made Friday:

To help raise funds for the JREF TAM Scholarship program, I am offering one person the opportunity to have a special mention in the acknowledgments section of the American edition of the book. Everyone bids in the auction, and I will work with the winner to come up with a fun sentence for the acknowledgment (e.g., 'Special thanks to xx, who has the wit of Oscar Wilde, the brain of Einstein and the beard of Darwin' or 'I would also like to thank the ever wonderful xx - without you this sentence would not have been possible'). The winner can also choose to use the acknowledgment to mention someone else rather than themselves, thus making it an unique present for a friend, colleague or loved one. All of the money raised goes to the JREF TAM Scholarship program.

(We also blogged about it &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/25/somethings-in-the-air/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/10/the-dark-side-in-aspen/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  PAMELA claimed to see an excess in the number of high-energy cosmic positrons (anti-electrons) over what you would expect from conventional astrophysical sources, while ATIC (which can’t distinguish between positrons and electrons) saw an overall rise in the number of positrons and electrons combined, more or less consistent with what PAMELA saw.  One dramatic but plausible explanation for this result is that the positrons are produced when dark matter particles and antiparticles annihilated with each other, which would certainly be exciting.  But it wasn’t quite a home run, because there was no evidence for the corresponding excess of anti-&lt;em&gt;protons&lt;/em&gt; you would probably also expect.  (Although that is not a deal-breaker; with a little ingenuity, particle physicists are able to come up with models that produce positrons but not anti-protons.)  There was also some controversy when theorists wrote papers trying to fit the data before the data were even published, by snapping pictures of plots shown at conferences with their cell-phone cameras.  More than enough drama for a TV movie, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist might imagine that all the excitement was intentionally manufactured, just so people would pay more attention to the first measurement from the new Fermi (formerly &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/06/11/glast-just-launched/"&gt;GLAST&lt;/a&gt;) gamma-ray telescope.  And now those results are in!  (Other &lt;a href="http://is.gd/wDOs"&gt;Fermi results&lt;/a&gt; have already appeared, but not about this particular question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the results are “in” in the sense of being published in &lt;a href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;amp;id=PRLTAO000102000018181101000001&amp;amp;idtype=cvips&amp;amp;gifs=yes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which helpfully charges $25 if you’re not a subscriber.  (Presumably it will be on arxiv soon, probably tonight.)  The best summary of the results, although somewhat technical, is by Bruce Winstein and Kathryn Zurek at &lt;a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/37"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the American Physical Society’s in-house journal that highlights interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are those results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/37"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/05/medium_e2.png" alt="Fermi electron/positron spectrum"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermi is more like ATIC than like PAMELA, in that it also cannot distinguish between electrons and positrons, so this graph shows both.  The blue line is a simple model that you might expect in the absence of any dark-matter annihilations, and the red points are the Fermi results.  If you look very closely, you can see the grey squares representing the ATIC data, which peak way up there between 100 GeV and 1000 GeV of energy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:  hmm.  Sadly it’s not a completely definitive result, either way.  (This is reflected in the coverage in the popular press, where, unlike the physicists, they need to come to a conclusion:  Ron Cowen at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/43413/title/Another_clue_in_the_case_for_dark_matter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says “Another Clue in the Case for Dark Matter,” while Adrian Cho at &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/502/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ScienceNow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says “Lights Out for Dark Matter Claim?”  Both do a good job in the body of their articles.)  The Fermi data are clearly lower than the ATIC data were — but they’re not quite as low as the simple model would predict.  The energy resolution of Fermi also isn’t quite as good — it’s harder for them to pinpoint the energy of each particle — so it’s conceivable that there is a sharp peak that simply gets smeared out by their instrument.  But I completely agree with Winstein and Zurek’s take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results, as precise as they are, do not definitively confirm or rule out a DM source. Although the large ATIC excess, which had been consistent with PAMELA, is ruled out, because of uncertainties from charge-dependent modulation in the flux from the solar wind, the Fermi and PAMELA data do remain consistent as having the same source. Since several natural astrophysical explanations can generate the Fermi and PAMELA spectra, the likely course is that one will be found there. It may simply be, as the Fermi paper points out, that the primary electron spectrum in the cosmic-ray source, predicted to fall as ~&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-3.3&lt;/sup&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is the particle energy), does not fall as steeply as thought in the energy range observed by Fermi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not too hard to imagine an astrophysical explanation that doesn’t require new physics beyond the Standard Model (which would still be interesting).  But more data would be nice.  We’ll keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in my e-mail in box this morning were lots of your e-mails warning me about a bit of news that shows definitively that Oprah Winfrey is beyond redemption, at least when it comes to any sort of medicine or science (not nice, given that I hadn't even had my morning coffee yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? Jenny McCarthy has&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSTRE5430RD20090504"&gt; inked a deal with Winfrey's Harpo Studios&lt;/a&gt; to develop a syndicated talk show and other media projects, including  a &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/bi/jenny-mccarthy"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, which has already started dishing out the stupid, albeit (thus far) not about vaccines and autism. Apparently sensing that her &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2007/03/05/the_secret/"&gt;advocacy of the New Age woo known as The Secret&lt;/a&gt; was not enough, Oprah appears to have decided that anti-vaccine quackery sells, and she doesn't care whom it kills as long as she can make some money at it. Given that Oprah is now giving a major platform to Jenny McCarthy to spread her quackery, I now say that, along with Jenny McCarthy, Oprah should get some of the blame when the inevitable outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases increase beyond where they already are, thanks to McCarthy's "efforts." After all, she is now supporting the pro-disease movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind me again: Why does anyone respect or admire Oprah?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/proof_that_oprah_winfrey_is_utterly_beyo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/g0FywJfMFR0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241456700806"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=10333">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7489304f96bb3851</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="food"/><title type="html">Recession Relief for Pâté Lovers</title><published>2009-05-04T16:40:33Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T16:40:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/recession-relief-for-pate-lovers/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Is your pâté consumption wreaking havoc on your pocketbook?

Community Living: I posted a while ago on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/community_options_to_meet_support_needs"&gt;community options to meet support needs&lt;/a&gt;.  There are some more (similar but different) ideas (and concerns) in the article &lt;a href="http://www.cjonline.com/life/2009-04-28/adults_with_autism_seek_help_guidance"&gt;Adults with autism seek help, guidance&lt;/a&gt; (which, despite the name, is actually mostly about some ideas for community living).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Movie Going: Remember the movie Adam, and a long-ago &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/consulting_on_adam_an_interview_with_jason_ross"&gt;interview here with Jason Ross&lt;/a&gt; who consulted on Adam?  Looks like &lt;a href="http://content.foxsearchlight.com/inside/node/3176"&gt;Fox Searchlight has picked up the movie&lt;/a&gt;--perhaps those of us who couldn't travel to Sundance will have a chance to see Adam on the big screen now?  I really hope so 'cause a (&lt;strike&gt;non-&lt;/strike&gt;captioned) &lt;a href="http://www.overstream.net/view.php?oid=ameosvuorat2"&gt;trailer is here&lt;/a&gt; and it looks really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Economic Tanking: These &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/147063.php"&gt;economic impacts on autism services in the UK&lt;/a&gt; sound pretty much the same as here in the U.S.  Unfortunately.  Why is it that services to small groups who need help most get cut before services to large groups that need help least?  How do we make our concerns better heard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Change Making: I've had more autism-related work than I can well manage the past week--public testimony during an all day autism event at my state capital, preparing a 30 minute presentation for the IACC, working on some pretty major projects in other areas...  It's made this roundup of news items from last week a little light, but hopefully I'll make up for that if I can get a moment to actually report back on Things Accomplished and Things Yet to Do.  We all have a lot of work behind us and ahead of us in order to see real improvement to our lives.  All of you who do the good work to make change for social justice, quality of life, education, it does matter.  From one week to the next it may not look like we got very far, but look from one year to the next, or one decade, or more.  We're getting there.  We will get there.  Keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241452980051"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/antivax-kills/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/188bc04e6a05de48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Antivax kills.</title><published>2009-05-04T16:00:18Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T16:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/antivax-kills/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing these posts is getting tougher and tougher. The comments get shriller and less rational from the antivax crowd; they scream their own personal anecdotes, they tell long-debunked lies, and do everything they can to avoid the fact that solid, rock-hard evidence shows no link at all between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the meantime, babies die because of the antivaccination movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and the rest of the ignorant antiscience antivax people are right, then &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/05/03/a-guest-post-from-david-mccaffery/"&gt;read this story&lt;/a&gt;. I dare you. David McCaffery writes about his daughter, Dana, who was four weeks old when she died. Too young to get vaccinated herself, she contracted whooping cough &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/the-australian-antivax-movement-takes-its-toll/"&gt;because vaccination rates in that part of Australia are too low to provide herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;. This poor little girl died in her father’s arms, and the blame rests squarely on the antivaccination movement. That’s not an anecdote, that’s &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/4h03w"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/mccaffery.jpg" alt="The McCafferys on Australian TV"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David and Toni McCaffery on Australian TV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dana’s story was told on the Australian TV show &amp;quot;Sunday Night&amp;quot; there was such a reaction that Channel 7 decided to hold a forum about vaccinations. Richard Saunders and Rachel Dunlop from The Australian Skeptics were there — you can read &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/05/02/a-brief-report-from-todays-debate/"&gt;Rachel’s personal account of the forum&lt;/a&gt; — and Richard &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmymvZefhKY"&gt;has posted video&lt;/a&gt; from the forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UmymvZefhKY%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is heartbreaking, and made worse by Meryl Dorey, the biggest antivax mouthpiece in Australia. Listening to her makes my blood boil. She is a typical antivax promoter: she has no real data, so she manipulates and spins. She throws baseless accusations at the doctor on stage, and uses all sorts of tactics like that to convince people she’s right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She isn’t. Vaccinations do not cause autism. Vaccinations have some small risk, but it’s far, far less than the danger from measles, rubella, whooping cough, and all the other easily preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then listen (at 6:30 into the video) to the woman who didn’t vaccinate her son. She herself says she doesn’t know enough about the issue to say much in response to another woman in the audience who was concerned over her own son’s safety. She admitted she doesn’t have all the facts, &lt;em&gt;but she still decided not to vaccinate her kid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. The antivax movement thrives on ignorance like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, at about 7:00 into the video, the McCafferys speak. It tears my heart apart to hear them talk about their baby daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good thing here is that Meryl Dorey had her arguments eviscerated by the doctor on stage. That’s because her arguments have no substance, no science, no real data behind them. All the antivaxxers have is panic and fear and lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor, and if they recommend it, vaccinate your kids. You may be saving far more than just &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; lives; the sad truth is that if more parents in Australia had gotten vaccinations for their children, Dana McCaffery would still be alive today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fight against vaccines, then keep that fact in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

This bit of jiggery pokery involves a study looking at calcium supplementation as an aid to losing weight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published (1) with much media fanfare (3,4,5,6,7) a few weeks ago. It suggests, based on a supposedly randomized and blinded placebo-controlled trial, that calcium supplements help some obese individuals lose weight. Study funding was from Wyeth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big time stuff, and also very controversial. It is certainly possible - but needs some proper science with reasonable numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worry comes from the same pot of dubiousness described in my previous post (the &lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/05/allegations-of-fraud-at-albany-wang.html"&gt;Wang case&lt;/a&gt;). Scientific authors, having published some findings and having enjoyed a media blitz, refuse to convey what they actually did ("method"), how they analyzed data (more "method"), the study protocol ("method")  or even a rudimentary plot of the data to allow basic plausibility evaluation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The particular refusal in this case is the most bizarre I have personally encountered from supposedly "scientific" authors. These authors refuse to reveal what the calcium supplement and placebo contain!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They state that this is "confidential".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I will discuss, this is hardly a trivial matter. It also makes me wonder whether peer-reviewers should sometimes be named and shamed for failing to ask the most obvious questions (as well as for raw data when necessary).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before discussing the authors' refusal, it is necessary to know a little about calcium supplements. As anyone who has ever conducted a calcium RCT will know, it is a headache trying to create a placebo. The placebo has to look and taste the same as the calcium. The problem is particularly acute when supplements are supplied in a solid form, because calcium supplements are BIG......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The participants in this study were given 1200mg of elemental calcium per day (about 3 grams of calcium carbonate plus flavorings and some vitamin D). Here is what a slightly lower dose of calcium (2 x 500mg) looks like (in the form of Cacit - P&amp;amp;G&amp;#39;s supplement).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thejabberwock.org/blogl/calcium.jpg" width="200" height="213" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those are mighty big chewy or effervescent tablets. Now the placebo has to consist of something, and that something cannot be pure air. It may be sorbitol, some other sugar, or something else altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what do we know about this study. Well, in the two so far published papers about this small RCT (1,2), both in prestigious nutrition journals, the authors write &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thejabberwock.org/blogl/plac.gif" width="327" height="135" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="What is the placebo?"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that's none too helpful. Even small timed doses of a variety of nutrients can have some big effects on gastrointestinal function, bone turnover, gut hormone release and satiety. Given the very modest weight "effect" in this study (calcium versus "placebo") the question of placebo composition is hardly arcane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also worried about the statistical analysis. The authors conducted a critical retrospective subgroup analysis on a small subgroup of participants. I don't plan to discuss statistical issues in this post, but the relevant questions should be obvious to any modestly critical reader or honest peer-reviewer. So I wrote to the authors asking about the composition of the placebo, and for the weight/calcium data (or at least a scatter plot of their key "finding").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was the first letter I wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Date: Mon, 23 Mar 2009 09:21:56 +0000&lt;br&gt;To: angelo.tremblay@kin.msp.ulaval.ca&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re:Calcium and weight study&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) Can you tell me the nature of the placebo since&lt;br&gt;this is not clear from the manuscript.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;b) Can I please have a copy of the raw data giving&lt;br&gt;only the weight before, weight after, calcium&lt;br&gt;intake and placebo/treatment assignments of each&lt;br&gt;patient?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours Sincerely&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dr Aubrey Blumsohn&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was met with a straightforward refusal to supply any raw data, and no response at all on the question of the placebo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I wrote again&lt;blockquote&gt;Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2009 15:12:57 +0000&lt;br&gt;To: angelo.tremblay@kin.msp.ulaval.ca&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re:Calcium and weight study&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) At least tell me what the placebo was&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) Send me a scatter plot showing all data points&lt;br&gt;for weight change versus baseline calcium intake for&lt;br&gt;placebo and treated arms separately. That is&lt;br&gt;directly related to what you published and not&lt;br&gt;different information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Aubrey Blumsohn&lt;/blockquote&gt;And this is what I received&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2009 15:12:57 +0000&lt;br&gt;To: Aubrey Blumsohn&lt;br&gt;From: angelo.tremblay@kin.msp.ulaval.ca&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re:Calcium and weight study&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bonjour Dr. Blumsohn,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I take once again several additional minutes to give you an &lt;br&gt;additional reply in an environment which is more and more demanding, &lt;br&gt;mainly because of electronic communication. My specific answers to &lt;br&gt;your specific questions can be summarized as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The placebo: The placebo was prepared by the company (Wyeth &lt;br&gt;Consumer Healthcare) who provided the financial support to this &lt;br&gt;study. &lt;strong&gt;We know what is the composition of the placebo but this &lt;br&gt;information is confidential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Scatter plot of data points: As I told you, we might consider that &lt;br&gt;and publish this information in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angelo T&lt;/blockquote&gt;A subsequent request for the study protocol was also met with refusal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this science and can these authors be held to be in any way "scientific" authors? Watch this space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally, "Tremblay A" appears to have published 8 papers in the past six weeks. &lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major GC, Alarie FP, Doré J, Tremblay A.

According to the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSTRE5430RD20090504"&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy has signed a contract to join Winfrey proteges Rachel Ray and “Dr. Phil” McGraw. For now, she’s blogging about PMS and sugar at Oprah.com. Be afraid – be very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/05/03/0503autismclinic.html"&gt;Mary Ann Roser reports in the &lt;em&gt;American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the alleged insurance fraud and autism quackery at Austin’s CARE Clinic. Our friend Dr. Stephen Barrett at Quackwatch first warned us about CARE in February, in a post appropriately titled &lt;a href="http://www.autism-watch.org/reports/casd/overview.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be Wary of CARE Clinics and the Center for Autistic Spectrum Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Roser’s piece stops short of warning parents, but she largely avoids false balance, making it clear there is no real science behind the “alternative treatments” employed by CARE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of an Austin-area clinic that treats children with autism — using techniques that are controversial in mainstream medicine — says investigations by three major insurers have left it with a pile of unpaid claims and a crisis: She’s had to lay off most of her staff and drastically reduce the clinic’s hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Kazuko Grace Curtin said the Texas Medical Board is investigating her medical director. She and the doctor — Jesus Caquias — say the investigation is a way of harassing them because they offer nontraditional care for autism patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great piece of investigative journalism that will work in just about any major media market, where shady clinics lure parents with unproven and potentially harmful autism treatments. Insurance companies, says Rosen, are finally catching on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ryan Coller takes no prisoners in his Sunday &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-coller3-2009may03,0,4461231.story"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; Op-Ed&lt;/a&gt; on the fabricated vaccine-autism link. The pediatrician and incoming chief resident at UCLA’s School of Medicine covers familiar ground, but it’s a message worth repeating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder the public is confused, with competing celebrities saying vaccines do or don’t cause autism and a lot of media attention on the subject. Vaccines, like every medicine, can have real side effects. Autism, however, is not one of them. Though I believe those who decline vaccines are doing what they believe is best for their children, their fears about vaccines and autism are not only unsubstantiated, they have been fully refuted. There is no rational reason to put children in harm’s way by declining vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are retreating into illnesses that had nearly vanished, and we are stalling research progress by deferring enormous sums of money to dismantle autism/vaccine theories and establish campaigns to educate families. Wouldn’t that money be better spent understanding the true causes of autism and pursuing effective therapies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must vaccinate against this misinformation, and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no herd immunity against ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Kristy Davies, general assignment reporter for south New Jersey’s &lt;em&gt;Courier-Post Online&lt;/em&gt; got an earful &lt;a href="http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20090502/NEWS01/905020362/1006/news01"&gt;while covering an anti-vaccine conference&lt;/a&gt; held in Cherry Hill. Rev. Lisa Sykes, &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/155/"&gt;whose vaccine-related lawsuit was dismissed last year&lt;/a&gt;, told the U.S. Autism &amp;amp; Asperger Association’s regional conference over the weekend  that the “The American government is labeling (autism) as genetic to protect industry from catastrophic liability. The madman named mercury has returned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Davies says she’s since been deluged with emails and calls, both pro- and anti-vaccine. “I was just there to cover a conference. I’m not writing any more about autism,” says says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Davies’ report is largely a recitation of anti-vaccine talking points with little effort at clarification or setting the record straight. But she still considers her story balanced. “I included what the CDC says about vaccines. The story is balanced,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here’s the paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no convincing scientific evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. But after a public outcry of concern in 1999 the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So if thimerosal has been removed from scheduled pediatric vaccines all these years, what is Rev. Sykes talking about? Informed readers need to know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241447013534"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/prehistoric_reenactment_centre.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/827ced61039969aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Prehistoric Reenactment Centre</title><published>2009-05-04T13:20:19Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T13:20:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/1dy4hEmykHo/prehistoric_reenactment_centre.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/prehistoric_reenactment_centre.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My buddy from the Swedish Skeptics, &lt;a href="http://www.faktoider.nu/index.php"&gt;author Peter Olausson&lt;/a&gt;, reports on a recent visit to the &lt;a href="http://www.ekehagensforntidsby.se/"&gt;Ekehagen prehistoric reenactment centre&lt;/a&gt; in Västergötland.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ekehagen Prehistoric Village&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By Peter Olausson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Åsarp near Falköping, in a landscape littered with passage tombs, you'll find Ekehagen. Founded in 1983, the centre has a number of houses built to show what Prehistoric life was like in Scandinavia, from huts of the Mesolithic to a farm of the Middle Iron Age (no Vikings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is not a museum. Walking around on one's own and studying the buildings etc. might work for people who already know what it's about, but would be comparably pointless for the rest of us; the main point is hands-on experience. You can book guides with which you participate in flint knapping, leather working, cooking, archery, trapping (they have a nice path with a couple of period game traps) and so on. Or you can arrive during one of the theme weeks they arrange every year. (Or book stays for several days, including sleep-overs in a period of choice.) There is also a restaurant and a modest shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of space here: some of the "attractions" are several hundred meters apart. Bring good shoes, and don't forget your mobile phone! In my opinion, this improves the atmosphere and general experience no end compared to what a crowded "Stone Age Disneyland" would have been like. The "home base" assigned to our group, a Mesolithic house, wasn't surrounded by noisy school classes -- they were elsewhere -- but by tranquil forest (with period tree species, I was told).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the scientific correctness regarding the many details, I really can't tell (that is, if there are any flaws, I couldn't spot them). But the staff sure loves to discuss the finer points of recreating history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/prehistoric_reenactment_centre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/1dy4hEmykHo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241446543855"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=10417">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76afa723af955b45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="debt"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Facebook"/><title type="html">The Self-Serving Policy Proposal Prize</title><published>2009-05-04T14:15:52Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T14:15:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/8eK6qSOXaVo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/the-self-serving-policy-proposal-prize/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We need a prize for the most self-serving proposal.

I can't blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one recorded sermon, Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Hensley, the chief of the US military chaplains in Afghanistan, tells soldiers that, as followers of Jesus Christ, they all have a responsibility "to be witnesses for him".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The special forces guys - they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down," he says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I say that because on Thursday, it was revealed that pharmaceutical company Merck, Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme paid Elsevier to produce a fake medical journal that, to any superficial examination, looked like a real medical journal but was in reality nothing more than advertising for Merck. As reported by &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;amp;o_url=blog/display/55671&amp;amp;id=55671"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Merck paid an undisclosed sum to Elsevier to produce several volumes of a publication that had the look of a peer-reviewed medical journal, but contained only reprinted or summarized articles--most of which presented data favorable to Merck products--that appeared to act solely as marketing tools with no disclosure of company sponsorship. 

&lt;p&gt;"I've seen no shortage of creativity emanating from the marketing departments of drug companies," Peter Lurie, deputy director of the public health research group at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen, said, after reviewing two issues of the publication obtained by The Scientist. "But even for someone as jaded as me, this is a new wrinkle." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which was published by Exerpta Medica, a division of scientific publishing juggernaut Elsevier, is not indexed in the MEDLINE database, and has no website (not even a defunct one). The Scientist obtained two issues of the journal: Volume 2, Issues 1 and 2, both dated 2003. The issues contained little in the way of advertisements apart from ads for Fosamax, a Merck drug for osteoporosis, and Vioxx. (Click &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540001.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540027.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to view PDFs of the two issues.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When an epidemic spreads to multiple regions, especially multiple countries or continents, it becomes a pandemic. Flu pandemics happen every 40 years or so, and we are due for one now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably partly why there has been so much news attention, even some mild hysteria, surrounding recent outbreaks of swine flu, beginning in Mexico. It is hard to say how many cases and how many deaths there have been so far, because information from Mexico is spotty. Specifically it id difficult to say if people who have died with flu-like symptoms really had the swine flu or something else. Estimates are that about 150 people have died in Mexico with the swine flu. It is clear that we are dealing with a new strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a little background. The influenza or flu virus is an RNA virus that comes in three genera - A, B, and C. Influenza A is the most common type. It can infect mammals and birds, with aquatic birds being its natural endemic host. Each year there is a seasonal epidemic of Influenza A, infecting millions of people and killing 100-200,000 - mostly the very old, the very young, and the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza B is less common than A and infects only humans, seals and ferrets. Influenza B mutates slower than A, and so has less genetic diversity and is less virulent as a result. Influenza C infects humans, dogs, and pigs and is the least common type, but can be virulent when outbreaks occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All off the pandemics over the last century have been of Influenza A. Its primary weapon is its ability to rapidly mutate, avoiding the immune systems of its hosts. This is why each year new strains of Influenza A are causing that season’s epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu starts out like a common cold, but lasts longer and becomes more severe. It is characerized by high fevers, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, and severe cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A strains are designated by the two main proteins that determine their infectivity and virulencs -haemaglutanin and neuraminidase, H and N. There are 16 Hs but only H 1-3 infect humans, and there are 9 Ns but only 1 and 2 infect humans. Haemaglutanin is a protein that allows the virus to latch onto and infect host cells, while neuraminidase allows expelled viruses  to reinfect other cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swine flu virus is Influenza A H1N1. This strain came about probably by four different strains of Influenza A infecting the same host (probably a pig, hence the name swine flu). Viruses can exchange genetic material, so one strain can combine bits from other strains, creating a new strain. The curren swine flu likely combined bits from a human virus, a bird virus, and two swine viruses, although this is still being confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu is potentially a fatal illness, killing about 1% of those infected. Death results from one of three types of causes - the flu infection itself can cause a serious pneumonia (lung infection) that can impair breathing to the point of death. A serious infection can also leave someone open to a superinfection (another organism causing a second infection while the host’s immune system is occupied with the flu). And those who have a chronic underlying illness may succumb from the added physiological stress added by the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should We Worry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week on the SGU we &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=197"&gt;interviewed Mark Crislip&lt;/a&gt;, and infectious disease doctor, host of &lt;a href="http://www.quackcast.com/"&gt;Quackcast&lt;/a&gt;, and contributor to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed in detail the latest swine flu outbreak, and what level of concern is currently appropriate. The bottom line is this - this is a new strain of flu virus which appears to be spreading. It has the capability of producing a world-wide pandemic, and if it does it could theoretically rise to the level of the 1918 pandemic which killed millions. Some of the reported deaths from Mexico were young healthy adults (which was also common in the 1918 pandemic), which can mean that the strain is virulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is too early to tell. This epidemic may also fizzle out quickly, ultimately affecting very few. In 1976 there was a swine flu epidemic with concerns that it would be the next big pandemic, but it just fizzled and amounted to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What determines whether this latest strain with be a bang or a bust is how infectious it is (how many people with catch the virus) and how virulent it is (how may infected people will die from the infection). We do not yet know how this current swine flu will behave  - we don’t have enough data points yet. Probably we will not know until the pandemic is underway, or until after it has burnt itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time there is no reason to panic or make major changes in your lifestyle. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are watching closely and will make recommendations. As of May 3rd the&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/"&gt; CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; 226 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 flu and 1 death. At present the CDC recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are sick are urged to stay home from work or school and to avoid contact with others, except to seek medical care. This action can avoid spreading illness further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it - they are not recommending that we limit international travel or that we start shutting down schools. Essentially, if you have a cold or flu-like illness, don’t tough it out and go to work - stay home and seek medical care if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO has &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/travel/en/index.html"&gt;similar recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. They are not recommending limiting travel at this time. While not explicity recommending the use of masks in public, they also provide &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Adviceusemaskscommunityrevised.pdf"&gt;guidance as to how to properly use a mask&lt;/a&gt;. The same document also details general recommendations to avoid spreading the infection - wash your hands, keep a meter away from symptomatic individuals, stay home if you are sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where we are today. If the infection continues to spread and show signs that it is developing into a pandemic, the WHO and CDC will update their recommendations.There are some possible signs already that this outbreak will not be the next major pandemic. &lt;a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP468702.htm"&gt;Mexico just announced&lt;/a&gt; that new cases of swine flu are already past their peak. Also, early numbers indicate that this strain is no more infectious or virulent than the usuall seasonal flu strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are treatments for the swine flu. This strain will respond to certain anti-viral drugs, which may decrease the severity of the illness and decrease the mortality. There is currently no vaccine for this strain, and it will take several months to mass produce one. Depending on the timing of the outbreak this may or may not be in time - but if it is a serious outbreak it will likely last several months, so the vaccine will come out toward the end. The role of the vaccine, therefore, may be to shorten the pandemic, but not to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Swine Flu Hubbub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the media has treated the swine flu with near panic. And not just the media - governments and health organizations like the WHO and CDC are stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they overreact to the potential threat then they are accuses of being hysterical. The US government and CDC were soundly criticized for sounding the alarm bells in 1976 when that swine flu amounted to nothing. Yet, if they under-react we could be left unprepared for the next major pandemic. Mark Crislip argued, and I agree, it is better to be a little over-prepared than a little under-prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already the WHO is being criticized for overreacting to this swine flu. In response &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e6260d9a-37d4-11de-9211-00144feabdc0.html"&gt;WHO officials warn&lt;/a&gt; that there could be a second wave of swine flu outbreaks in a month or two - which is what happened in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems silly to play this game - reacting to reactions and then defending with more warnings. Rather, the WHO, CDC, and world governments should plan prudently for a pandemic, and then hope to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the hysteria is countries fighting with each other. Mexico is getting a little defensive that travel and exports from Mexico may be restricted - so maybe they are downplaying the number and severity of cases to avoid this. Other countries, even old allies, are bickering over recommendations for travel restriction. Concerns have already been raised that the UK might horde their flu vaccines, leaving the US high and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the purpose of an organization like the WHO is to coordinate international information and efforts to avoid this very type of national bickering in times of a world-wide health crisis. What may be the most worrisome aspect of this outbreak is not the outbreak itself but the response to it. It makes me wonder if we are as ready as I thought we were for such an outbreak. Still I am optimistic - if and when the next big pandemic hits I think the WHO, CDC and similar organizations will rise to the task and do what is necessary. Behind the headlines, their recommendations and actions are all reasonable and prudent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, with swine flu grabbing headlines the quacks and cranks have come out of the woodwork to exploit the situation to push their woo and pseudoscience. Offers for snake oil for the swine flu infected spam last week, accounting for 2% of all spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post, rapidly becomming the leader of health pseudoscience on the web, has had several recent posts recommending every sort of dubious health treatments and preventions for the swine flu. Orac at Respectful Insolence &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;does a nice takedown&lt;/a&gt; of the swine flu woo over at the HuffPo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the &lt;a href="http://www.kxan.com/dpp/health/swine_flu_conspiracy_theories_swirl"&gt;conspiracy theorists have to have their say&lt;/a&gt; as well. They can see the Truth behind the hype that the swine flu was manufactured as part of the latest government dark cabal conspiracy to control the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present there is no cause to panic over the swine flu. Yes - this could be a serious outbreak, but we just have to wait and see. So far the early signs are already indicating this will not be a major pandemic, and may already be on the way out. But we still have to watch closely to see which way it will go. The CDC and WHO will be the best sources of information in the coming weeks, while news headlines are likely to be misleading and sensational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best recommendations are to take simple and rational steps to avoid getting infected, or if symptomatic to spreading the infection to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if the swine flu of 2009 proves to be like the 1976 fizzle, eventually we will be hit with another pandemic. For every pandemic there are likely to be a dozen false alarms. The public should not be dismayed by these false alarms nor should they lose faith in the CDC and WHO when early warnings do not pan out. Their job is to keep their eye on early outbreaks, knowing most will not amount to a pandemic, but waiting for the one that will. We need to avoid a “boy who cried wolf” syndrome the press seems intent on manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is rustling in the bushes it is appropriate to cry wolf, knowing most of the time it will just be a deer or something else. But if we wait until the wolf is at our throats, it will be too late to react.&lt;/p&gt;

And this time we have a twofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/shostak_giveaway.jpg" alt="Seth Shostak giveaway items"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alien not included.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.seti.org/view.image?Id=543"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Shostak is an astronomer who hunts for aliens… with &lt;a href="http://www.seti-inst.edu"&gt;SETI&lt;/a&gt;. He just wrote a book called &lt;a href="http://www.seti.org/alienhunter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confessions of an Alien Hunter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s wonderful. It’s a fun discussion of looking for other civilizations among the stars and Seth’s involvement with SETI. In my opinion this is his best book yet, and that’s saying something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a two-CD set of Seth’s podcast/radio show &lt;a href="http://radio.seti.org/"&gt;&amp;quot;Are We Alone&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It has recordings of several episodes, including one with moi — I do a Skeptical Sunday bit with Seth called &amp;quot;Brains on Vacation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the book and the CD are signed by Seth his own self, and I put my signature on the CD too (the book actually has an official &amp;quot;Are We Alone&amp;quot; sticker that Seth signed for me because I stupidly forgot to get him to sign the book directly when he was here in Boulder last month). These items will be given away &lt;strong&gt;separately&lt;/strong&gt;. I may throw in extra junk I have lying around my office too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you win these fabulous things? Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is leave a comment on this post. Just post something in the comments below, like &amp;quot;Phil rulez and Seth droolz&amp;quot; or something equally elegant. It doesn’t matter what you post as long as you post something. On Friday, May 8 at noon Mountain time (UTC - 6), I will generate a random number, and the person who leaves that number comment wins the book. I’ll then pick a second number, and that person wins the CD set. I’ll send the winners emails notifying them, and they’ll have until Monday May 11th at noon MT to get back to me. I’ll pick another commenter if I don’t hear back by then. That person will have until noon the next day to get back to me, and so one, until winners are chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some rules for you. READ THESE. Violate them and I’ll send your email address and IP to the ShamWOW guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Leave a comment &lt;strong&gt;ONLY ONCE&lt;/strong&gt;. I trust you folks, but I feel I must make this warning: No matter how tempting it is to followup on someone else’s comment, &lt;em&gt;don’t do it&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone caught doing that (or cheating in any way) not only won’t win the book, but your comment will simply be deleted. Be ye fairly warned, says I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Make sure that you enter a valid email address in the form when you leave your comment. If you don’t, you won’t win, since email is how I will contact the winner. Since I’m busy and bore easily I won’t try to figure out your address; if there’s no valid email, I’ll simply pick another winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) To be fair, if you’re an actual friend of mine IRL then please don’t apply. I’ll leave it up to your own judgment if you fall in that category or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Anyone else is eligible, including all you foreigner types.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you have until noon Friday! So comment away!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241440782773"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/marys_monday_metazoan_they_mus.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7e262b64e299d89</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: They must be friendly, they're smiling</title><published>2009-05-04T13:00:41Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T13:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ZYcPuWyWXr8/marys_monday_metazoan_they_mus.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/marys_monday_metazoan_they_mus.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/enlarge/baby-alligators-nest-johns_pod_image.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/05/marys_monday_metazoan_they_mus/baby-alligators.jpeg" width="424" height="275" alt="baby-alligators.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/marys_monday_metazoan_they_mus.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ZYcPuWyWXr8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241439031848"><id gr:original-id="543 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdfd52990b4693c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Centre for Social Cohesion" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/666"/><category term="CSC" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/667"/><category term="Daily Mail" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/79"/><category term="Islam" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/221"/><category term="Islamophobia" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/668"/><title type="html">Smearing British Muslims Through Opinion Polls</title><published>2009-05-04T10:48:06Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T10:48:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/543" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote about what I called the "&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/211"&gt;disgusting misrepresentation of British Muslims&lt;/a&gt;," the publication of heavily biased opinion polls by apparently Islamophobic lobbying groups, that were quickly picked up and promoted by elements of the right-wing press.

Yes, as &lt;a href="http://getweb.info/science/?p=2960"&gt;the tragic case of baby Gloria Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, another victim of of the delusions of homeopathists will hopefully show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last months of her life, baby Gloria Thomas suffered such terrible eczema her skin would weep and peel, sticking to her clothing when she was changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite her bleeding, crying and malnutrition, her mother and homeopath father failed to get conventional medical help before she died a painful death, a Sydney jury has been told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents, Thomas Sam and Manju Sam, have pleaded not guilty to manslaughter by gross criminal negligence at a court in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloria died aged just nine months in 2002, having been ill for over five of those months. Her parents failed to get her proper medical attention, and as a result she spent those months - more than half of her young life - &lt;i&gt;"crying, irritable, scratching."&lt;/i&gt; By the time of her death from septicaemia, she had lost 20% of her body weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatives pleaded with the parents to see sense, but were ignored:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Thomas Sam's sister had pleaded with her brother on a number of occasions to get Gloria some conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He responded by saying: 'I am not able to do that,'" Mr Tedeschi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead, Thomas Sam and Manju Sam gave to Gloria various types of homeopathic drops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father himself was a quack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father was educated in homeopathy in India and in Australia undertook a masters degree in health administration, while his wife had a science degree and a postgraduate diploma in computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Sam worked as a homeopath in Sydney and taught the subject at a Sydney college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathists are deeply deluded people, playing doctors and nurses with imaginary potions that contain no real medicine. When these fantasies are limited to giving someone magic water for their indigestion, they are fairly harmless, but when they begin to believe that they can replace proper medical treatment, they become very dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well now she’s stuck her foot in her mouth again. This time &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/03/michele-bachmann-lies-about-a-founding-father-obama-etc/"&gt;she perpetuates a popular myth invented by Christians about an alleged prayer George Washington delivered himself at his inauguration&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim that Washington wanted everyone to behave like Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are a few problems here. First, Washington delivered no such prayer. Second, it’s not even a prayer but a redaction of a direct statement to a governor rewritten to look like a prayer. Third, Washington wasn’t a Christian and only believed in a Deist god. Fourth, George Washington also owned slaves. So by Bachmann’s logic, I suppose it’s in the best interests of the country for us all to own slaves too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Founding Fathers were just people. While they were incredibly wise in some ways, they were also men of their time with all the limitations that come with that. And Founders themselves had the good sense to recognize that they didn’t have all the answers. That’s why they designed a government that could change with the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachmann of course also said a bunch of other nonsense but who has time to correct it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve started this film and blog project in which I want to ask the question “why is science important?” to people who feel the importance of science so deeply that they have dedicated their lives to it — working scientists, science writers and, of course, science teachers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really loved this &lt;a href="http://lablit.com/article/483"&gt;interview with him&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;British teachers seem to have the notion that we should teach science because it’s ‘relevant’, because we live in a technological world: “your iPod was made with science so you should understand science”. This is bollocks. It misses the point of science. Science is an amazing way of thinking, of looking at the world, at arriving at answers; it’s an entire culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one of those “DUH” things that’s blatantly obvious once it’s pointed out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blurb about science as a way of knowing from the film:&lt;/p&gt;

I've been reading the page proofs for Jim's book, &lt;a href="http://irishwaterfront.wordpress.com/"&gt;On the Irish Waterfront: The Crusader, the  Movie, and the Soul of the Port of New York&lt;/a&gt;. It's due out in September of this year from &lt;a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/"&gt;Cornell University Press&lt;/a&gt;; it's about the port of New York and New Jersey; about certain "boys of the Irish waterfront"----including Joe Ryan, president of the International Longshoremen's Association, Frank Hague, major of Jersey City from 1917-1947, and William McCormack, a "devoutly Catholic enterpreneur known as the waterfront's 'Mr. Big'"; about the real-life Jesuit, John M. "Peter" Corridan, S.J. who was a crusader against the "rampant mob power" embodied in the likes of those three men, and who was the model for the waterfront priest in the 1954 Academy Award winning movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/"&gt;On the Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chelsea piers and the whole West Side of New York, and Jersey City, Hoboken, and Hudson County are the backdrop for Jim's book. They're also places that have been the backdrop for many of us three's adventures since May 2001, when we moved back to New Jersey from St. Louis, Missouri, in search of the best education we could find for Charlie. As I've been reading Jim's manuscript, I keep noting titles and authors of books that I remember him checking out at numerous libraries across New Jersey and New York. Charlie was often with us and spent a certain amount of time walking up and down the steps of university libraries or seeking out sodas in the campus stores and (when he was much younger) chasing squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, there's not much to compare about the Irish waterfront and life &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;on the autismfront&lt;/a&gt;.  Having just gotten through &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_way_up"&gt;putting together yet another IEP for Charlie&lt;/a&gt;, I have had the thought of "getting sufficient services for Charlie" running through my mind like an over-familiar refrain. I also spoke last week to Charlie's case manager at the Department of Developmental Disabilities, during which I was told that we're still on the waiting list for respite services---if that list is as long as the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/sued-new-jerseys-department-of-human-services/"&gt;one for housing for adults with developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, it'll be the twelfth of never before Charlie receives either respite or housing. And while we feel very much that our advocating for these services and others connects us with many others, we're also aware that, when push comes to shove, it tends to be everyone---every family---for themselves, for their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the services, therapies, schooling that an individual with disabilities needs can feel like being in the shapeup.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The shapeup is the traditional system of hiring longshoremen on the waterfront; in his &lt;a href="http://irishwaterfront.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/on-the-irish-waterfront-the-crusader-the-movie-and-the-soul-of-the-port-of-new-york-by-james-t-fisher/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, Jim quotes this description of (overwhelmingly Irish) longshoremen gathering at the Chelsea piers on the West Side of New York, hopeful of finding work, from Charles Brinton Barnes's 1915 study &lt;i&gt;The Longshoremen&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long several hundred have gathered on the far side of the street from the piers. Just before seven the foreman blows his whistle for them to "shape"; that is, to take their places in a half circle in front of the pier. As far as the space allows, this semi-circular line is always kept, but the number of rows deep the men may stand is limited only by the number seeking work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crowd of people gathering together to, when the whistle blows, make their grab for a day's work unloading a ship: This image makes me think of all the parents I've known who, along with us, have been constantly throwing ourselves into the ring to get the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/need_school_placement_move_the_house"&gt;placements&lt;/a&gt; and programs, services and supports, therapies and treatments, for our kids. I'm not sure how much Charlie will be able to self-advocate on his own for himself when he's an adult, but I know he'll still be one in a long line---in an anxious crowd---seeking housing, a job, staff to support him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image for this post is the cover of Jim's books; you can see a bigger version &lt;a href="http://irishwaterfront.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/on-the-irish-waterfront-the-crusader-the-movie-and-the-soul-of-the-port-of-new-york-by-james-t-fisher/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The picture is of a crowd of longshoremen and a cop on the right. Everyone is looking in a different direction; it's not clear what they all might be looking at. It's a scene of chaos, with one hatted man wearing an expression that looks like it can only be a snarl. The cop doesn't look like he knows anything more than anyone in the photo (and his baton is just enough in evidence). The hood of a car from the earlier part of the previous century protrudes into the picture---police? some one important, like a boss or Mr. Big type? Are these men waiting in the shapeup? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that chaos and no one knowing where to look: That's not a bad way to sum up not only us harried parents looking every which way for services and supports, but also what's sometimes called the "autism community." I say "sometimes" because I'm not sure how much of a sense of a community there is. People fall into small and distinct communities about certain issues, about treatments, educational models, causes; about questions of what autism is and whether it can "cured." Often I think we're so busy looking in whatever direction we think most important at the moment that we let our understanding of what binds us together atrophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like those longshoremen who stood in the shapeup, there's something that's drawn us all together in the same place. We tend to spend a lot of time elbowing our way through the crowd to get what we so ardently need. I don't know if, at this time, we're able to stand still for a moment and reflect on what joins us together. If joining and forging connections might ever happen, perhaps we could move past the fractiousness---the so-called "autism wars"---and make a difference together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it would be something powerful if we could be such a united front.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241421549274"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-1202101623825269220">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8a687a1dc9d9b7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Ebay Stuff" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Monday eBay" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday eBay: Begging Off</title><published>2009-05-04T06:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T06:48:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/05/monday-ebay-begging-off.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">I have a term paper to finish tonight, so no time for Monday eBay.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dolphins have a clever trick for overcoming sleep deprivation. Sam Ridgway from the US Navy Marine Mammal Program explains that they are able to send half of their brains to sleep while the other half remains conscious. What is more, the mammals seem to be able to remain continually vigilant for sounds for days on end. All of this made Ridgway and his colleagues from San Diego and Tel Aviv wonder whether the dolphins' unrelenting auditory vigilance tired them and took a toll on the animals' other senses?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having strong memories of that rich, delicious dessert you ate last night? If so, you shouldn't feel like a glutton. It's only natural. UC Irvine researchers have found that eating fat-rich foods triggers the formation of long-term memories of that activity. The study adds to their recent work linking dietary fats to appetite control and may herald new approaches for treating obesity and other eating disorders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Relationships are difficult and most of us probably think at some point that communicating positively with our partner when discussing stressful issues, like home finances, is an impossible task.  What if there was a safe way to take the "edge" off these discussions?  The biology of human social relationships is just beginning to emerge as groundbreaking research on social cognition conducted in animals is now informing research in humans. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During infancy, each of us emerges from a delightful but largely incoherent babble of syllables and learns to speak - normally, in the language of those who care for us. But imagine what would happen if we were somehow raised in utter isolation from other people, not only our parents but also from surrogates such as nurses and nannies. What sort of culture might we evolve if reared in isolation? Would we learn to speak? Would such a language evolve over multiple generations? If so, would it eventually resemble existing ones?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_667.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/FzMFH_-dmH0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241413554477"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=473">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e906adcfd741109</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Health Fraud"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Homeopathy"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Vaccines"/><title type="html">The Huffington Post’s War on Medical Science: A Brief History</title><published>2009-05-04T05:01:03Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T05:01:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=473" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I realize that our fearless leader Steve Novella has already written about this topic twice. He has, as usual, done a bang-up job of describing how Arianna Huffington’s political news blog has become a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=463"&gt;haven for quackery&lt;/a&gt;, even going so far as to entitle his followup post &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=470"&gt;The Huffington Post’s War on Science&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s absolutely right. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; waged a war on science, at least a war on science-based medicine, ever since its inception, a mere two weeks after which it was first noticed that &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;anti-vaccine lunacy ruled the roost there&lt;/a&gt;. Because I’ve had experience with this topic since 2005, I thought I’d try to put some perspective on the issue, in order to show you just how pervasive pseudoscience has been (and for how long) at the blog whose name is often abbreviated as “HuffPo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ANTI-VACCINE LUNACY AT &lt;em&gt;THE HUFFINGTON POST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My disdain for The Huffington Post’s treatment of medical science goes way, way back–all the way back to its very beginnings. As I mentioned before, a mere two or three weeks after Arianna Huffington’s little vanity project hit the blogosphere, I noticed a very disturbing trend in its content. That trend was a strong undercurrent of antivaccination blogging. At the time, a “friend” of mine &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; how Santa Monica pediatrician to the stars and “vaccine skeptic” &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt; (whom both &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; and I have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt;) had found a home there, along with David Kirby, author of the mercury militia Bible &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evidence of Harm&lt;/a&gt; (and who has been a regular &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;punching bag of mine&lt;/a&gt; for at least four years, and deservedly so), and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-grillo"&gt;Janet Grilo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These anti-vaccine “luminaries” were soon joined by &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=198"&gt;whose anti-vaccine activism&lt;/a&gt; I have discussed before) and more recently by &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deirdre-imus" rel="nofollow"&gt;Deirdre Imus&lt;/a&gt;, the driving force ramping up the antivaccinationist mercury militia proclivities of her husband, aging shock jock Don Imus. (Indeed, if &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; didn’t exist, Deirdre Imus would get my vote for the antvaccine zealot who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/deirdre_imus_gives_everyone_some_stupid.php"&gt;routinely says the most astoundingly ignorant things about science&lt;/a&gt;.) Although we don’t hear much from Grilo or Gordon anymore, other than an occasional &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php"&gt;specious analogy&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;tobacco companies and the pro-vaccine stance of the CDC and AAP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/tamiflurumsfeldh1n1-redux_b_191606.html"&gt;nonsense about Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately we do hear from Kirby, Imus, and Kennedy on a fairly regular basis, all on &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, with one of the few voices of reason when it comes to vaccines being &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-allen"&gt;Arthur Allen&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="http://vaccinethebook.typepad.com/"&gt;Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine’s Greatest Lifesaver&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Allen &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-allen/"&gt;has not posted to HuffPo in a long time&lt;/a&gt;. Given this history, it’s not for naught that on occasion I’ve referred to &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; “Arianna’s Home for Happy Antivaccinationists” and noted that it’s been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/a_science_section_for_the_huffington_pos.php"&gt;seriously questioned&lt;/a&gt; whether it could ever do a real science section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, while anti-vaccine “luminaries” such as David Kirby and RFK, Jr. regularly delivered the anti-vaccine propaganda on HuffPo, former Media &amp;amp; Special Projects Editor of The Huffington Post, Rachel Sklar was quite &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/03/its-bullst-jenny-mccarthy_n_94854.html"&gt;impressed with McCarthy’s antics&lt;/a&gt; on CNN back in April 2008, when McCarthy shouted down pediatricians and scientists who tried to refute her scientific ignorance. Since then, she has e-mailed me to argue that she is not “anti-vaccine,” and I will take her at her word, but she sure could have fooled me with her &lt;a rel="nofollow"&gt;breathless praise of Jenny McCarthy’s boorishness&lt;/a&gt; last April on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/em&gt;. Soon after, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-rose-levy/jenny-mccarthy-and-the-au_b_95366.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alison Rose Levy&lt;/a&gt; joined her. In recent days, I’ve learned that Levy also happens to be a booster of other forms of unscientific medicine and was recently &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-rose-levy/the-doctors-prescription_b_170846.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;very impressed&lt;/a&gt; with the testimony of Dean Ornish, Andrew Weil, Mehmet Oz, and Mark Hyman, at the Institute of Medicine that I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, arguing that their talks were nothing more than the same old pseudoscientific justifications for “integrating” pseudoscience and faith-based medicine with science-based medicine. Indeed, of late, HuffPo even invited a &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/kim_stagliano_1/" rel="nofollow"&gt;managing editor&lt;/a&gt; of the antivaccine propaganda blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-stagliano" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Stagliano&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_huffington_post_adds_another_antivac.php"&gt;blog for it&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t get more anti-vaccine than that–one of the “editors” of the most prominent anti-vaccine blog promoting the scientifically discredited idea that vaccines somehow cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, just a little more than a week ago, surprising me, given that I had been waiting for Jenny McCarthy to make an appearance as a blogger on HuffPo, her much more famous boyfriend, Jim Carrey, started blogging for HuffPo with an incredibly inane bit of anti-vaccine propaganda entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Judgment on Vaccines Is In???&lt;/a&gt; In it, Carrey regurgitated all manner of anti-vaccine talking points, including &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;the “toxins” gambit&lt;/a&gt; (apparently &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Dr. Jay&lt;/a&gt; never warned Carrey just how much it reveals Carrey’s ignorance to use the “formaldehyde” or “antifreeze” in vaccines gambit); parroted the intellectually dishonest Generation Rescue “&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/autism-and-vaccines-around-the-world-vaccine-schedules-autism-rates-and-under-5-mortality.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;” that tries to correlate the vaccine schedules of various nations with their autism prevalences (which I discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and its equally intellectually dishonest “&lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;” website (discussed by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, leading to an &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;all-out personal attack on him by J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=466"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;; and, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;). Suffice it to say, the intellectual incompetence on display by Carrey was very reminiscent of at least one of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;characters he used to play on &lt;em&gt;In Living Color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in the 1990s. The post even had a similar structure to one of his old sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that the blogging culture of HuffPo is steeped in anti-vaccine pseudoscience. If that were all that’s wrong with HuffPo, it would be bad enough. But it’s not. This year, HuffPo blogging has taken a turn for the worse. For HuffPo, this year is the year of the quack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2009: THE EMERGENCE OF RANK QUACKERY IN &lt;em&gt;THE HUFFINGTON POST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HuffPo has been home to more than just anti-vaccine propaganda over the years. Perhaps the most famous example is the regular appearance of that maven of “quantum” healing pseudoscience, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt; (whose &lt;a href="http://intentblog.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;IntentBlog&lt;/a&gt; often crossposts the same nonsense), who of late has become a point man in the battle to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=336"&gt;coopt President Obama’s plans for health care reform&lt;/a&gt; in order to insert unscientific ‘alternative medicine” under the guise of “wellness” and “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=400"&gt;prevention&lt;/a&gt;.” On the HuffPo, he has laid down all sorts of nonsense about &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=153"&gt;dualism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_chopra_delusion.php"&gt;“intelligent design” creationism&lt;/a&gt;, universal consciousness, and “quantum” healing. All of this is standard fare for Chopra, and, for the most part, that’s as far as HuffPo went into dubious medical science outside of vaccines. Indeed, before 2009 advocacy of rank quackery not related to vaccines in the HuffPo has been relatively slight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, that changed. Big time. Enter licensed acupuncturist, certified clinical nutritionist, and a homeopath (not to mention &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt;HuffPo’s new “Wellness Editor”&lt;/a&gt;). Here is how she is described in her &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald"&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has a Master’s Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Doctorate in Homeopathic Medicine. She is the founder and Medical Director of the &lt;a href="http://www.santamonicawellness.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Santa Monica Wellness Center&lt;/a&gt; and the author of the best-selling, award-winning &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970829906?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=detoxsolution-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0970829906"&gt;The Detox Solution: The Missing Link to Radiant Health, Abundant Energy, Ideal Weight, and Peace of Mind&lt;/a&gt;. You can learn more at &lt;a href="http://www.thedetoxsolution.com"&gt;TheDetoxSolution.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On HuffPo, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald"&gt;Patricia Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; has recommended a “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/spring-cleaning-10-steps_b_177154.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;spring cleaning&lt;/a&gt;” for your liver for “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/detox-demystified-fad-fac_b_179900.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;detox&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/jenny-mccarthys-autism-cr_b_190486.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;praised Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and her promotion of “biomedical” quackery for autism. I can’t help but speculate that in this case, the correlation between Fitzgerald’s arrival and the major uptick in the number of posts touting unproven and pseudoscientific medical practices on HuffPo may well equal causation, even though Fitzgerald appears to be relatively careful not to go too far off the deep end in terms of the health care practices she advocates on HuffPo. She, at least, is apparently smart enough to qualify them and stick mostly with diet and exercise as her cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramping up the woo a bit more into Deepak Chopra territory is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay"&gt;Srinivasan Pillay&lt;/a&gt;, “certified master coach, psychiatrist, brain imaging researcher and speaker,” whatever that means (other than psychiatrist). As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/03/huffpo_does_it_again.php"&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out, his “brain imaging” publications in PubMed are pretty darned sparse, mostly functional MRI studies, which are very difficult to do correctly in order to obtain any correlations or useful data. If his HuffPo presence is any indication, I hate to think what he’s doing with that fMRI machine. His first major “contribution” was an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay/the-science-of-distant-he_b_177986.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Science of Distant Healing&lt;/a&gt;, in which he purports to present the “scientific evidence” for distant healing. Distant healing, for those who may not be aware, is the magical belief that just by sending one’s “intent” or wishes to a distant person one can actually heal that person or send one’s “intent” to him or her. I say “magical” belief because there really isn’t any other word to describe it. There’s no scientific or physical mechanism by which it can occur, at least none that scientists have yet been able to find. His followup post, with Pillay seemingly irked at all the criticism he received for his distant healing article, was aptly entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay/why-rational-thinking-is_b_183082.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Rational Thinking Is Not All It’s Cracked Up to Be&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he concludes that, because humans are irrational, science can never be rational, never realizing that the scientific method itself is a system designed to minimize the effects of human cognitive biases and shortcomings on the observation of nature. Steve Novella &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=516"&gt;had some real fun with the nonsense in this post&lt;/a&gt;, and I can’t say that I blame him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, like Fitzgerald, Dr. Pillay is relatively careful to stay in the rather mystical quantum world of Deepak Chopra and not to directly advocate anything clearly dangerous. The same cannot be said of other bloggers, as not long after Fitzgerald’s arrival a new quackery apologist lit up HuffPo with some of the most outrageously dangerous quackery I’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m referring to &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Evans&lt;/a&gt;, “author of &lt;a href="http://www.cleaningupcleanse.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleaning Up!&lt;/a&gt; and the creator of The &lt;em&gt;Cleaning Up!&lt;/em&gt; Cleanse, a powerful body cleanse that addresses deep levels of toxicity throughout the body and a common fungal problem, candida overgrowth.” She goes on to describe herself in her &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans" rel="nofollow"&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim believes that toxicity in the body is at the root of most all disease and impacts us in ways spiritually that perhaps defies current spiritual understanding. She also believes that most disease can be permanently removed from the body with deep body cleansing, upgrading your on-going diet and consciously avoiding common toxicity sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim has spent thousands of hours researching, studying, cleansing and experimenting with different cleansing techniques and has eliminated more than a dozen problems in her own body - including several problems that medical doctors had no solutions for. She’s given people information that when they applied it, eliminated their health problems and had medical doctors adding years to their life expectancy - in addition to asking what they were doing so they could pass the information along to their patients because they had “never seen anything like it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog can predict the sorts of nonsense that Ms. Evans has been laying down about “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/detoxificationthe_pinnacle_of.php"&gt;detox&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=88"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=93"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; “cleanses.” And lay it down she has, claiming that “detox” &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/antibiotics-cause-cancer_b_186968.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;can get rid of fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; which, she claims that 90% of us have. Of course, 90% of us do have &lt;em&gt;candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; growing on or in our body somewhere, but in the presence of a competent immune system, it doesn’t cause any problems. That’s not what Kim Evans is saying. She’s claiming that 90% of us have “overgrowth” or are infected with candida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve has already discussed Kim Evans’ quackery advocacy twice, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=463"&gt;pointing out&lt;/a&gt; that her claim that antibiotics cause cancer and that fungus is cancer is rank quackery and that her defensiveness over the criticism that she is promoting pseudoscience is, in fact, an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=470"&gt;excellent example of how pseudoscientists think&lt;/a&gt;, rife with logical fallacies, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=208"&gt;postmodernist nonsense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tu quoque&lt;/em&gt;, as did a certain “friend” of mine. However, because I’m a surgical oncologist, I can’t help but briefly discuss one aspect of Kim Evan’s world view that disturbs me greatly. Specifically, it’s her belief that Dr. Tullio Simoncini is correct about cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DANGEROUS CANCER QUACKERY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is Dr. Simoncini? He’s an Italian physician who claims to be an oncologist, whose claim to fame is the invention of the quackery–yes, quackery–that claims that cancer is in reality a &lt;a href="http://www.curenaturalicancro.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;fungus and that all cancer can be treated and cured with sodium bicarbonate&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a video in which Simoncini describes how he came to this conclusion as he hawkshis book &lt;a href="http://www.cancerisafungus.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cancer Is A Fungus&lt;/a&gt;, makes the argument that fungus is the &lt;a href="http://www.cancerfungus.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;One True Cause of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; and that the medical establishment is Too Deluded or Too Blind to realize it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid%3D-2137356552230941410%26hl%3Den%26fs%3Dtrue&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=150" width="300" height="150"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Simoncini proposes a treatment that, even if cancer were a fungus, is completely implausible and wouldn’t work. Indeed, we don’t treat fungal infections that way even when we are treating a clearly diagnosed fungal infection. You can get an idea of just how quacktastic this video is by listening to Dr. Simoncini opine in the first couple of minutes of the vide that whenever he sees a cancerous tumor in the body, the lumps are “always white.” He emphasizes this amazing observation several times, so apparently important is it. Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was the observation that supposedly led him to his idea (I refuse to dignify it with the term “hypothesis”) that tumors are in fact due to fungus. In response, the host gushes about how brilliant that is and how obvious it is. Just crush up a mushroom! Of course, it would be a major blow to Dr. Simoncini’s idea, would it not, if not all mushrooms are white. Truly, Dr. Simonici has demonstrated the the ultimate in taking a flawed observation and running with it straight off the cliff, as this &lt;a href="http://www.cancerisafungus.com/" rel="nofollow&amp;quot;"&gt;description of his book&lt;/a&gt; shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book “Cancer is a fungus” describes how a fungous infection always forms the basis of every neoplastic formation, and this formation tries to spread within the whole organism without stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to wonder what kind of oncologist Simoncini is if that’s all he’s seen. From my experience as a surgeon, it’s trivial for me to tell you that not all tumors are white. Many are, but a lot of them are brownish-colored, tan, or even greenish-colored. (Uh-oh, better not let Dr. Simoncini know that; that’s fungus color we’re talking!) And what about leukemias and other blood cancers? Dr. Simoncini then shows a bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy demonstrating white tumors.  I’m supposed to be impressed by this? He also argues that in reality cancer is due to “excess acidity” that allows the fungus free rein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the answer, according to Dr. Simoncini? Baking soda. Yes, baking soda, a.k.a. sodium bicarbonate. Dr. Simoncini injects sodium bicarbonate into tumors and claims to be able to cure any cancer using these injections. One thought that immediately comes to mind whenever I see a claim like this is: If Dr. Simoncini can actually do what he claims he can do, where are his publications? Where is his Nobel Prize? To be able to cure cancer by something as simple as injections of sodium bicarbonate directly into tumors would be such an incredible breakthrough that there’s no way it could be kept quiet. Yet somehow only Dr. Simoncini knows this remedy, which is not only physiologically incredibly implausible and isn’t even used to treat real, biopsy- or culture-proven fungal infections but has no evidence to support it. There’s a whole culture of acid-base quackery that I’ve been meaning to write about in more detail, and Dr. Simoncini would be right up there among its chief “practitioners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Dr. Simoncini has been a focus of attention for the Italian health authorities.All I could find was this &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=113061"&gt;thread on the JREF forums&lt;/a&gt;. According to various commenters, not only was Dr. Simoncini expelled from the Italian Medical Order (&lt;em&gt;Ordine dei Medici e Chirurghi&lt;/em&gt;) but he was condemned in the first degree by an Italian court for cheating and homicide. Here’s one report from a woman by &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showpost.php?s=a51663b621daf67a0eca7df8f2e1d636&amp;amp;p=3830322&amp;amp;postcount=28"&gt;the ‘nym of JennyJo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, tullio simoncini was giving his treatments with sodium bicarbonate in a private clinic for alternative ‘medicine’ in Bilthoven in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 2007, a woman with curable breast cancer, who was afraid of operation and chemo therapy, came into contact with simoncini and was treated by him. He injected large doses of baking soda into her breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fourth day of the therapy, the woman became very ill and was transported to a university hospital in Amsterdam, where she died the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter is since under investigation by the Dutch Justice Department. Simoncini denies he ever treated the woman, although various staff members have seen him administering injections. The clinic maintains the woman died of dehydration (sic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More application of science to Dr. Simoncini’s quackery can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.123hjemmeside.dk/cancer_is_not_a_fungus"&gt;Cancer Is Not A Fungus&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, the &lt;a href="http://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/reports/simoncini.shtml"&gt;Quackwatch affiliate Cancer Treatment Watch&lt;/a&gt;. There’s just so much wrong with Simoncini’s ideas that at some point I may well jump into the ring myself with a more detailed explanation of just what is so wrong and why. Suffice it to say Dr. Simoncini is without a doubt the very picture of a quack. Also suffice it to say that Kim Evans believes in Simoncini’s quackery and views him as “persecuted,” as this &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/antibiotics-cause-cancer_b_186968.html?show_comment_id=23381077#comment_23381077" rel="nofollow"&gt;comment by her&lt;/a&gt; reveals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tullio Simoncini, yes, he had his license revoked, and there are reasons for that. In modern medicine today, medical doctors must practice standard accepted procedures, and if not, their license is in jeopardy. Let’s be clear, Dr. Simoncini was not going the standard and accepted chemo and radiation route. He found something far more effective and posed no harm to the patient. But because it was outside standard practice, he had his license revoked. Unfortunately, vitamin and herbal therapies also fall outside standard accepted practice, and are not often taught in medical school, as this community seems to think that only drugs are effective and little else plays a role in the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of videos on the net if you care to watch Dr. Simoncini pour an alkaline solution of baking soda and water as close to a tumor as possible, and have the tumor disappear, often in a matter of days. While I grant that it is possible that Dr. Simoncini could be wrong about the cause of the tumor (I don’t believe he is, but for arguments sake, I’ll allow that possibility), I find it hard to believe that after graduating from oncology school he doesn’t know what a tumor looks like. Or that the videos showing the tumors being eliminated were somehow not eliminated or not tumors to begin with. So, even if the cause was incorrect, the fact that these tumors are being quickly eliminated seems pretty straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Evans, Simoncini is a persecuted martyr for the One True Cause of Cancer who’s being attacked because he’s supposedly better at curing cancer than “”outside of standard practice.” Never mind that it has zero physiological plausibility, relies on a model of cancer causation that is trivial to demonstrate to be utterly incorrect, and has zero evidence other than the lowest quality testimonials to support it. Never mind that it’s never been convincingly demonstrated that injecting anything into a large, established tumor will cure it, much less solutions of baking soda. Never mind that Simoncini has been directly linked to the deaths of patients from his quackery. Again, if Simoncini could really do what he claims and demonstrate it to accepted scientific standards, the Nobel Prize is his. I suspect, however, that the Nobel committee won’t be considering him any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of irresponsible promotion of outright quackery that HuffPo permits within its pages, but it doesn’t end even there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SWINE FLU QUACKERY AT HUFFPO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the recent scare over the likelihood of a swine flu pandemic, the quackery level has ramped up even more at HuffPo, led by (who else?) Kim Evans, who penned a post called &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/swine-flu-protect-yoursel_b_191550.html"&gt;Swine Flu: Protect Yourself and Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, Evans is more than willing to recommend her detox quackery to protect against swine flu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleansing involves changing your internal environment and specifically, removing a bunch of the stored waste that most people have trapped in their bodies. Most estimates are that the average person has ten or more pounds of stored waste just in their colon, and I’d argue far more throughout their body. In any case, many people have found that disease disappears when this waste is gone, and that when the body is clean it’s much more difficult for new problems, like viruses, to take hold in the first place. And it’s my understanding that many people who took regular enemas instead of vaccines during the 1918 pandemic made it out on the other side as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Evans is recommending enemas and “detox” quackery to protect yourself against the swine flu. I can tell you one thing; this woman is utterly ignorant of history.There was no vaccine against influenza during the 1918 influenza pandemic. In fact, influenza vaccines were only developed &lt;a href="http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=6"&gt;widely available during World War II&lt;/a&gt;, where they were used to protect our soldiers. After the war, development of the vaccine continued. Moreover, there are not–I repeat, not–ten or twenty pounds of “stored waste” in the colon that are making people sick, and it especially isn’t feces in your colon that gives you the flu. Any surgeon who’s ever operated on the colon regularly (as I used to do until I subspecialized) or gastroenterologist who does endoscopy knows this to by a myth, but it’s the basis of so much enema quackery, as is the belief that the liver needs “help” dealing with these unnamed “toxins” through purging and enemas. Indeed, this obsession with “toxins” and poo caking the inside of the colon is nothing more than the alt-med version of the religious belief that one is “unclean” and desperately needs “purification” in order to achieve righteousness but all the enemas in the world won’t purify believers in this woo. They always think they are “toxic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is Matthew Stein, who wrote a post entitled  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-stein/when-a-super-bug-strikes_b_192543.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;When a Superbug Strikes Close to Home, How Will You Deal With it?&lt;/a&gt; (also published in a patently unreadable form on &lt;a href="http://www.whentechfails.com/node/1447" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stein’s own website&lt;/a&gt;). After a whole lot of fear-mongering over “superbugs” and swine flu, Stein presents his answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are many alternative medicines, herbs, and treatments that can be quite effective in the fight against a wide variety of viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, to which mainstream high-tech Western medicine has little or nothing to offer. The bad news is that 99 percent of the doctors in our hospitals are not trained in these alternatives, and don’t have a clue about what to do when their pharmaceutical high-tech medicines fail to heal. If you wait until a pandemic starts, you will have only a slim chance for locating an available health practitioner familiar with alternative herbs, medicines, and methods. In the words of Robert Saum, PhD, the typical attitude amongst most of his medical colleagues in this country is, “If I didn’t learn it in medical school, it can’t be true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, according to Matthew Stein, there are all of those “natural cures ‘they’ don’t want you to know about” for all those nasty, horrible, resistant bacteria. And, of course, those nasty, close-minded “allopathic” physicians are too clueless or prejudiced against them to learn about them or offer them to you. Even better, they will heal when the products of big pharma fail. So says Stein, who even claims that homeopathy could be an answer, citing an article &lt;a href="http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/30/fighting_the_flu/"&gt;Could Homeopathy Prevent a Pandemic?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we have alternatives? During Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which killed up to 50 million people worldwide, homeopathic physicians in the U.S. reported very low mortality rates among their patients, while flu patients treated by conventional physicians faced mortality rates of around 30 percent. W.A. Dewey, MD, gathered data from homeopathic physicians treating flu patients around the country in 1918 and published his findings in the Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy in 1920. Homeopathic physicians in Philadelphia, for example, reported a mortality rate of just over one percent for the more than 26,000 flu patients they treated during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a number of homeopathic remedies for the flu are available, including oscillo, or oscillococcinum, which has been shown to shorten the duration of symptoms when taken within 48 hours of onset. Homeopaths have been given this remedy since 1925. Interestingly, it’s made from the heart and liver of ducks, which carry flu viruses in their digestive tracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on clinical studies, homeopathy produces some of the fastest results in relieving flu symptoms,” says Dana Ullman, MPH, the author of nine books on homeopathic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s been a regular here for a while probably remembers Dana Ullman, the homeopath who seems to have a lot of time on his hands to Google himself for new mentions on blogs and then infest blogs that criticize him and homeopathy. I have little doubt that he will show up here. If you want the best deconstruction of Ullman’s nonsense, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=448"&gt;new Internet law&lt;/a&gt; that my coblogger Kimball Atwood laid down about him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any discussion involving science or medicine, being Dana Ullman loses you the argument immediately…and gets you laughed out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How true. Moreover, Stein’s falling for the same old claims by homeopaths that somehow patients treated with homeopathy only suffered a 1% mortality compared to conventional physicians, whose patients supposedly suffered a 30% mortality. As co-blogger David Kroll pointed out a couple of years back, these are the same sorts of nonsense claims that were &lt;a href="http://terrasig.blogspot.com/2006/02/diluting-diseaseor-deluding-yourself.html"&gt;trotted out during the avian flu scare&lt;/a&gt;. Of course there’s a big problem here. No doubt homeopaths &lt;em&gt;reported&lt;/em&gt; low mortality, but was there any objective evidence that they actually observed such low mortality in their patients? What about selection bias, where the less severely ill patients chose real medicine instead of homeopathy? How do we know that patients who got sicker under the homeopaths’ care didn’t go to real physicians or die without being followed up? Do we know that the homeopaths’ patients were comparable to the patients treated by “conventional” medicine? We don’t. Finally, if the peer review of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy&lt;/em&gt; is anything like the peer review of homeopathy journals in 2009, I don’t have high hopes that Dewey’s article was subjected to anything resembling rigorous peer review. That hasn’t stopped it from being trotted out in the intervening 90 years since the Spanish flu pandemic by homeopaths every time a flu pandemic or flu scare comes up. Truly, it is a zombie study that just won’t die, and a HuffPo blogger is promoting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all Stein is promoting. He’s also promoting something called the Beck protocol, which consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood electrification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colloidal silver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic pulsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozonated water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beck protocol could take up an entire post on its own, and perhaps someday I will write one. In fact, each of the four elements of the Beck protocol could be the topic of its very own post, and perhaps I should do a four-parter. However, in the meantime, regular readers should recognize that each of these four elements is quackery. But even that level of quackery isn’t enough for Stein. He finishes with a list of a veritable panoply of herbalism, supplements, and other dubious remedies to “protect yourself” against the swine flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, another HuffPo blogger, Lisa Sharkey, opined in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-sharkey/what-most-doctors-wont-te_b_193614.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;What Most Doctors Won’t Tell You About Preparing for the Swine Flu&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can I do to keep my family safe? How can I boost our immune systems now and what complementary medicines can I begin taking immediately, regardless if I ever come in contact with the dreaded Swine Flu? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what sort of answers are coming, I bet. That’s right: Supplements, herbalism, homeopathy, reflexology, tapping, this post is a veritable cornucopia of quackery for swine flu, with Sharkey touting it all as “immune-boosting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She even prefaced her post with the typical “dodge the FDA” disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; This swine flu story on alternative and complementary medicine is not meant to replace anything you hear from you doctor, the WHO or the CDC, but is meant to show you some natural ways to enhance your overall wellness in addition to any medication you may need either to prevent or treat the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very appropriate, I would say. Too bad the rest of HuffPo’s health bloggers don’t add the same disclaimer to their posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; IS HEALTH PSEUDOSCIENCE SO INGRAINED AT &lt;em&gt;THE HUFFINGTON POST&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the pervasiveness of anti-vaccine views, New Age mysticism and pseudoscience &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;/em&gt; Deepak Chopra, and, most recently, outright quackery at HuffPo, one is left to ask: Why? Why is health pseudoscience and even outright quackery so pervasive at HuffPo? Why is it that (as I have been told) so many commenters who try to counter this nonsense find that their comments are “moderated” (a.k.a. censored), as I myself have experienced when trying to counter anti-vaccine posts I’ve seen on HuffPo. Why is it that a woman who so profusely praised President Barack Obama in an &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6188629.ece"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; about his first 100 days for reversing the Bush Administration stand on embryonic stem cell research, runs such a site so full of quackery? Huffington in particular praised Obama’s statement that it is “about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda, and that we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology.” I agree. It’s a fine sentiment, long overdue after the Bush administration. Too bad Arianna Huffington doesn’t apply President Obama’s sentiment to her own blog and kick out the quacks and pseudoscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the question is, once again, why? Why doesn’t Huffington kick out the quacks? Part of the answer, at least, is suggested in an article in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; that appeared about her last fall entitled &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/13/081013fa_fact_collins"&gt;The Oracle: The Many Lives of Arianna Huffington&lt;/a&gt;, in particular these excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a student-group fair, Huffington toured the chambers of the university’s debating society. Since girlhood, she had possessed a spiritual impulse, studying Hinduism and fasting on the name day of the Virgin Mary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffington’s business and spiritual pursuits merge in her interest in human-potential movements, the sorts of popular groundswell that, as she once wrote, will provide us, in “a new age that is being born,” with “an opening for great possibilities of new being, for a breakthrough in our evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Huffington has been touchier about her relationship with John-Roger, the baby-faced spiritual leader of M.S.I.A., who was born Roger Delano Hinkins in Rains, Utah, in 1934, and, in 1963, rechristened himself upon his emergence from a nine-day coma induced by kidney-stone surgery. In an investigation published in the Los Angeles Times in 1988, the reporters Bob Sipchen and David Johnston linked John-Roger—whose students believe that he has unique access to a power called Mystical Traveler Consciousness—to financial and sexual improprieties. (John-Roger stated, through a spokesman, that the allegations “remain as untrue today as when they were first published.”) His views on the body are certainly unusual: In “Sex, Spirit &amp;amp; You,” he writes, “When a woman has a history of blocking her creative flow and shutting off this area of expression by pushing the energy back down into the creative center, she may develop many problems related to her menstrual flow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple eventually embarked on a period of metaphysical inquiry that alienated some of their friends and colleagues as much as it entertained the press. Christopher Hitchens wrote, “Let the record show that in October 1979. . . Bernard Levin achieved the total state of self-absorption towards which he had been moving for so long. The venue was the Café Royal: amid incense and vaguely Oriental music, flanked by his companion, Levin rose and told a large invited audience how they could be ‘changed,’ by investing £150 in a 50-hour ‘Insight training.’ ” (Insight was founded by the spiritual leader John-Roger, with whom Huffington has remained affiliated. Huffington denies that incense and Oriental music played a role in the event.) When Levin died, in 2004, his obituary in the Times noted that Huffington’s “interest in mystic cults . . . was to lead him into one of the more embarrassing episodes of his journalism—his hyperbolic praise through a number of columns of the self-promoting guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Hitchens, even when I don’t agree with him (which is fairly frequently on political topics), always has a way with words. And, most impressively, there is this descriptoin of Arianna Huffington:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all her incarnations, Huffington’s interest in mass movements, human potential, and the improvability of man has been as consistent as her suspicion of pharmacology, utilitarianism, and Skinner boxes. Her own life may be her greatest project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five decades of self-improvement, she has tried fire-walking, list-making, journal-keeping, mercury detoxification, homeopathy, chiropractic, infrared saunas, microdermabrasion, est, and—she writes in her 2006 book, “On Becoming Fearless”—“the Beverly Hills diet, the all-brown-rice diet, the grapefruit diet, the cabbage soup diet, the no carbs, no fat, indeed no calories diet.” Her daily regimen includes yoga, meditation, and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, in this article, at least, Arianna Huffington comes across as a credulous New Age believer, flitting from one woo to the next, one quackery to the next, with no apparent understanding of why they are woo and quackery. Anyone who can embrace homeopathy uncritically is not someone who runs her life from a science-based perspective, all of her praise of President Obama’s sentiments about science and all of her claims not to be a relativist described in the New Yorker article notwithstanding. It is thus not surprising that her political blog would reflect this. However, until recently HuffPo’s bad medical science was primarily limited to its support of anti-vaccine bloggers such as David Kirby, Kim Stagliano, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and, most recently, Jim Carrey. Recently, however, HuffPo’s promotion of pseudoscience has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT TO DO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the recent surge in quackery promotion on HuffPo, there has been a debate in the blogsophere over what, if anything, can be done. My co-blogger Peter Lipson has described the promotion of quackery on HuffPo as a “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/05/huffpos_dangerous_assault_on_m_1.php"&gt;dangerous assault on medicine&lt;/a&gt;” and suggested a “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/vendetta.php"&gt;Vendetta!&lt;/a&gt;” of sorts, in reality a letter-writing campaign in which writers are urged to present “specific examples of their malfeasance, and asking them to consider altering their editorial policy on health issues, for the sake of morality, health, and humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I understand the sentiment, sadly, I don’t think that it will do that much good, unless it somehow impacts HuffPo’s bottom line in terms of the page views that determine advertising rates. The antivaccine nonsense, for example, has been very deeply ingrained in HuffPo blogging culture from the very beginning. I highly doubt, for instance, that Arianna would ever kick Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. off of HuffPo or allow any of her editors to do so. He’s just too high profile a liberal voice. Similarly, given how the influx of outright quackery has coincided with the tenure of the new “wellness editor,” I highly doubt that, short of removing her, any level of complaints will dislodge the quacks. I’d love to be wrong, but I fear I’m not, which is why I don’t think it’s a bad idea at least to try to deluge the editors with complaints about the recent spike in quackery blogging on HuffPo, the most irresponsible and utterly opportunistic of which are the claims by various charlatans that homeopathy or “detox” regimens can somehow protect you from the swine flu or that “cancer is a fungus” and sodium bicarbonate can cure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janet Stemwedel, who blogs at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience"&gt;Adventures in Ethics and Science&lt;/a&gt;, echoes a question I’ve been asking myself for a while now, namely &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/another_conundrum_whether_to_e.php"&gt;whether to engage with The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should scientists and physicians try to do something about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, blogular dissections of problematic HuffPo posts count as responses, and I know a great deal of work goes into countering flaky reasoning with logic while preventing one’s own head from exploding. But it’s not clear how many of the responses to HuffPo posts arguing that enemas and prayers will be sufficient to protect us from swine flu are getting to the large HuffPo audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, if HuffPo invited a scientist or physician to write an article, would it be a good idea or a bad idea to accept the offer? Would it help the HuffPo readers? Would it hurt the scientist or physician?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the answer to that one. On the one hand, any respectable physician or medical scientists who blogs about health on HuffPo runs the risk of taint by association, along with a deluge of HuffPo CAM aficianados shouting “pharma shill” in the comments. Moreover, such a person risks being coopted by HuffPo’s editors as “evidence” that HuffPo does provide an outlet for science-based blogging about health. On the other hand, HuffPo has a very large readership, far larger than even the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;most popular of science bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, it’s the front page political blogs that drive most of the traffic, and it’s unclear how much traffic that the many dozens, if not hundreds, of other blogs on HuffPo actually garner. Still, there’s no doubt that, if it continues on its current path, HuffPo may someday rival &lt;a href="http://www.whale.to" rel="nofollow"&gt;Whale.to&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mercola.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt;. Should medical scientists try to stop that by “joining up,” so to speak? And what would be the price? More importantly, would joining up be more effective in muting the cheerleading for quackery on HuffPo than remaining outside and ruthlessly criticizing and mocking examples of it? Should we try to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXsIkt1JVNU"&gt;“fight from the inside” or “attack from the rear”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I don’t know the answer to this question. However, this question is  somewhat more than hypothetical, which is why I need to contemplate it further. In either case, something needs to be done to counter HuffPo’s war on medical science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so I’m a doofus sometimes. I’m giving a talk Monday night in Denver, and it’s part of the American Physical Society meeting being held there. So I assumed it was only for members, but it turns out it’s open to the public, so I’m a little late in announcing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture will be about asteroid impacts, based on the first chapter of &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, and it will be at &lt;a href="http://www.sheratondenverhotel.com/"&gt;the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, May 4. I was told the talk was at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/april/events/spec-sessions/plait.cfm"&gt;the meeting website says 7:30&lt;/a&gt;. You should get there by 7 if you want to make sure &lt;em&gt;[Edited to add: I’ve confirmed &lt;strong&gt;the talk DEFINITELY starts at 7:00!&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll hang out with any BABloggees who arrive early if I can. The website doesn’t say anything about an admission price, so bring a few hundred bucks to throw at me as needed.

&lt;p&gt; The crank in question is Walter Wagner, the moron who tried to use a lawsuit
to stop the LHC from being activated. (Just that much, already, is amazingly silly;
he sued in Hawaii, but the LHC is in Geneva, Switzerland. How does a Hawaiian court
have any jurisdiction?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway... Wagner claims that the LHC could destroy the earth. See, there's a tiny theoretical chance that the right collision in the LHC could create a microscopic black hole. According to Wagner, if that happens, the black hole will swallow the entire earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; That claim is, itself, based on some pretty bad math. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; theory that predicts
that it's possible to create a microscopic black hole &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; predicts that such a black
hole would evaporate - that is, would completely disappear in a burst of energy - immediately. The
exact same math that predicts that you could create a black hole in a high-energy collision also
predicts that the hole would be destroyed before it had time to do any damage. If you tweak it so that the black hole lasts longer, the energy requirements change so that it's no longer possible to create it in the LHC. To make the black hole last a microsecond is absolutely beyond the
energy of any collider that we could ever build on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But let's skip that - demonstrating that is pretty complicated. To get an idea of
the level of understanding of the guy who claims that there's a real danger, let's just
take a look at what he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When asked what the probability of the LHC destroying the earth is, he says 50%. Why?
Because either it could happen, or it couldn't - therefore, there's a 50% chance of it happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; You could argue that that's naive Bayesian reasoning - but if you did, you'd be an idiot. Classic Bayesian arguments about stuff like this would say that you use 50/50 as an initial prior &lt;em&gt;in the absence of any other information&lt;/em&gt;; then you adjust that based on whatever
other information you have available. For Mr. Wagner's stupid argument, it's based on
a complex physical theory - a complex physical theory &lt;em&gt;which provides lots of information
which you can use to update your probability estimate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mr. Wagner's 50/50 claim is based on the fact that he's absolutely clueless about how any of

Many thanks to our Australian guest blogger Katharine for helping out with a post when I could use the help, well, quite a lot :-)]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aarongoselin/1535837953/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2317/1535837953_bb095b1458_m.jpg" alt="a composite photograph of young white male with very short hair and his mouth and eyes open wide. the top of his head is open about 60 degrees like a hinge, and a plastic brain is pictured where, well, his brains are." style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am currently reading two books--'Embracing The Wide Sky' by Daniel Tammet and 'See Jane Lead' by Lois P. Frankel. Why am I reading such books? I have just asked myself that question and the answer doesn't come all that easily. It's something about the search for meaning and wanting to be better. Better? Better than what? Better than anyone who has ever said that I can't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lately I'm the one with the broken record - the 'I can't' story, the 'I'm not good enough' story, the 'I'm a fraud' story. Years of listening to others and the compounding self generated ruminations has brought me to another existential impasse.  I am left in the dark having to prove myself to myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tammet, an Asperger man with Savant syndrome writes of a possible way out of my quandary. He speaks of multiple intelligences, training the brain for happiness, and practice and perseverance being at the root of exceptional skill. So it is as easy as that - I'll just train my brain to think BETTER. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BETTER? BETTER THAN WHAT? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better than men? Lois Frankel is going to tell me how to do just that, be better than men - at work; in fact she will share 99 Ways for Women to Take Charge at Work. I'm going to combine High Self Expression with High Concern for Others and become the Assertive Leader I need to be to influence my colleagues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Tammet and Frankel talk about IQ and EQ the Intelligence and Emotional Quotients. Tammet discusses the alarming history of the IQ test and its use as a tool for the weeding out of imbeciles. Both agree that the Emotional Quotient has been a useful addition to the way we view behavior and assert that, according to Goleman (the father of EQ), the better my EQ the more likely I am to succeed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankel also introduces LQ--the Likability Quotient. Likability Quotient!--I do believe I'm thwarted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence--I have accepted that my Autistic Intelligence can't be measured and that I am left without a full scale IQ, Emotionality--well I'm very emotional but it takes exceptional focus to rein that in and try to begin to read and understand the emotions of others (a science for me), but Likability--how do I contend with that one.  Apparently like autism, likability also falls on a spectrum. My LQ must fall somewhere between an inordinate need to be liked and a complete lack of care for how others perceive me.  Let's not forget for a second that I also have an AQ (Autism Quotient) [ed. &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html"&gt;link to AQ&lt;/a&gt;]--I've taken the online test! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have to think about my LQ while I continue to Embrace Tammet's Wide Sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe with my combined IQ, EQ, AQ and LQ I will be BETTER! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BETTER?&lt;/p&gt;

Now that we've made it through &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_way_up"&gt;another year's IEP&lt;/a&gt;, I've been recalling IEP meetings and school placements (and strained discussions over these) of years past. I've mentioned time and time again about us moving several times in search of a school district with the right kind of program for Charlie. Just living one town over here in New Jersey can make a significant difference for Charlie's education and, accordingly, his future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving's never fun or easy as it involves a huge transition, not to mention packing, for all. So what about this for a solution: Rather than packing up one's worldly possessions to move and get a child into a school district with an appropriate program, how about just moving the house? (Here's a house small enough to go on the road; it's &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/ontheblock/detail?entry_id=39458"&gt;7 x 18 feet&lt;/a&gt; and has a "kitchen, a seating area, a (fold-down) table for eating, a (walk-in closet) bathroom and a sleeping loft," and also a fireplace, as noted on yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/ontheblock/detail?entry_id=39458"&gt;SFGate&lt;/a&gt;).  Of course, one still has to find a piece of real estate to put the house on........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, sometimes you just have to move to find the right program. Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/may/01/parents-autistic-children-move-martin-get-kids-hop/"&gt;TC Palm&lt;/a&gt; reports on a family who moved from Trinidad to Florida so that their son could attend an autism school and a column in the &lt;a href="http://www.halifaxnewsnet.ca/index.cfm?sid=164376&amp;amp;sc=611"&gt;Halifax New Net&lt;/a&gt; describes a family who moved far away west across Canada in pursuit of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is never easy for anyone; not easy for an individual like my son who relies on a great deal of routine and order in his world. So I suppose a house that could move with you could be considered to have some advantages, though no way &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/ontheblock/detail?entry_id=39458"&gt;7 x 18 feet&lt;/a&gt; would ever be enough space for my son (let alone, to be honest, his parents).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241391368104"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/664a300abfb3f954</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Diet and health.

But with some caveats. I have been known to hit a PayPal button of people who provide content and information I find valuable. And I would presumably pay, though not being happy about it, if the information behind the pay wall is a) unique (i.e., not found anywhere else by any other means) and b) indispensable for my work (i.e., I would feel handicapped without it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am not subscribed to, or paying for, anything right now and haven't been in years. Not even &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/science-2-0/7011705b/faculty-of-1000-interview-with-richard-grant" title=""&gt;Faculty of 1000&lt;/a&gt; which, one can argue, is important for my work. If I need a reprint of a paper for personal use (or perhaps to consider blogging about) I get it from the author, or if that does not work, from a friend with access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am intrigued by the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/04/introducing_cognitive_monthly-.php" title=""&gt;announcement of 'Cognitive Monthly'&lt;/a&gt;, a $2 per issue publication by Dave and Greta Munger. I got the reviewer copy of the first issue. I read it. I loved it. Would I pay $2 for something like that every month? I had to think about it long and hard, but my final answer is, actually, Yes. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an easy question to answer. I think a big part of my decision is the fact that I know Dave and Greta very well, in person, so I am positively predisposed to help them in this endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also a long-time regular reader of 'Cognitive Daily' - I know from experience that their posts are interesting to me. I am personally very interested in cognitive psychology of sensory perception, human behavior in traffic (driving, biking, etc.), human behavior in respect to social norms, ideology and fashion, etc. Even in busiest weeks, I'll read at least the Science Friday post (and often participate in their research polls). Thus, I am wondering if I would have said Yes if I was unaware of Cognitive Daily from before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first issue, about the way theatrical productions use various illusions (light, sound, etc.) to draw the audience in, so the audience gets transported into a different place and time, is absolutely fascinating. Also, the production level of the issue is much greater than any one of their blog posts - it is longer, has a great introduction to the historical context, lots of interesting information, is written really well - this is a full-blown article that could appear in any reputable (popular science or general interest) magazine. And yet they say that this one is just a trial and that the future issues will be even more thorough. So, it is definitely an extremely high quality product, not just a quick blog post that comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is definitely fulfilling my criterion a) - it is unique. But is it b) as well? I can function professionally just fine without it, so why would I buy this every month anyway? I don't know. I just feel that the personal education and enrichment I got from reading this article was worth $2 to me. It is hard to be rational about this - I just liked reading it and it was worth it to me. And I can't wait for the next issue. I am actually - gasp - excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they can do a Science Friday poll and post about this - are you more likely to pay for something if you are told in advance to think about this question? I read a lot of stuff online and never think "would I pay for this?". But I did this time because I was asked to keep that question in the back of my mind while reading it. Did this make me more predisposed to try to give the piece a monetary value and, in comparison to $2 they are asking the deal looked good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a try yourself - you can get their stuff at &lt;a href="http://stores.lulu.com/wordmunger" title=""&gt;Lulu.com&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/cognitive-monthly-may-2009-the-illusion-of-theater/6954562" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the first issue) in color, or on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;search-type=ss&amp;amp;index=digital-text&amp;amp;field-author=Dave%20Munger" title=""&gt;Amazon for Kindle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00284AV0K" title=""&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt;) in black and white. Take a look and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be watching this experiment with interest. If someone as jaded as I am got excited and is willing to pay for more of that "fix", I am wondering if that will work for others as well. What will be the numbers of buyers on any given month, what percentage of those will be return customers, how will the word-of-mouth affect sales of any given issue (e.g., if one of them gets a lot of play on Twitter etc., and another one not so much), etc.? Definitely an interesting experiment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/cognitive_monthly.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/k9lT-g95tig" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241381320002"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_urge_to_do_it_on_his_own">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c56eababfb5a9610</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Urge To Do It On His Own</title><published>2009-05-03T13:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-03T13:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_urge_to_do_it_on_his_own" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.motiontrends.com/2006/m02/dodge/dodge_nitro_slt_dials.jpg" height="160" alt="Steering wheel from http://www.motiontrends.com/2006/m02/dodge/dodge_nitro_slt_dials.jpg" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/sfl-missing-west-boca-boy-p042809,0,5254488.story"&gt;Kenton Weaver&lt;/a&gt;----the Florida boy who drove his dad's Ford Explorer to the Fort Lauderdale airport, parked the car in the garage, and (without ID) got onto a plane to San Jose earlier this week---is 13 years old, just about the same age as my son Charlie. Charlie, I quite suspect, would not have been able to pull off such a journey---with his limited language skills, I would think someone at some early stage in the game would figure something was up, and hopefully Charlie would be able to respond quickly to any questions about (for instance) his phone number (he has my always-on cell phone number memorized as his home phone). And Charlie driving----I think I can pretty reliably say that he wouldn't get too far behind the wheel. For one thing, he still has trouble tracking moving objects (like moving cars) and driving being a task which involves the coordination of multiple activities and quick observation and execution, it's not likely that Charlie will ever be getting behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking more about whatever it was that impelled Weaver to undertake such a journey in the first place. Weaver had lived in St. Louis prior to his parents divorcing; he had been living with his father, Dean Weaver, in Boca Raton. His mother, Kimberly Casey, lives in Fresno, California, and said in the April 29th &lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/sfl-missing-west-boca-boy-p042809,0,5254488.story"&gt;Sun-Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's having issues," Casey said. "He was ultimately trying to get to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divorce and moving from St. Louis has been hard on the teen, Casey said. Life's been hard too. Because of birth defects, Weaver had to have surgery when he was 1 day old because his intestines were in his chest cavity, his mother said. He's also had two heart surgeries. The seventh-grade special-education student at Eagles Landing Middle School west of Boca Raton has been under a psychiatrist's care since he was 5, his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I love him and I'm going to be really happy to see him," his mother said Wednesday before reuniting with him. "And I'm just going to enjoy that for a moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/sfl-missing-west-boca-boy-p042809,0,5254488.story"&gt;Sun-Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, "Weaver's parents remain stunned by what he did and that he was undetected" and it's unclear whether he'll stay with his mother or return to his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering how much of a desire to go out and explore, to do something on his own, to be independent, might have impelled Kenton Weaver on his transcontinental odyssey. Of late, my own son has started to hop on his bike and start pedaling away and going fast down the street just as Jim is strapping on his helmet. Jim's a fast bike rider himself and catches quickly up to Charlie. My worry is more about Charlie getting his bike out, donning his helmet, and speeding off down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more likely that Charlie, given the chance, would head to a place he'd been to before and, most likely, a place offering preferred food items (the bagel place, the supermarket, McDonald's----Charlie's biked past them all). And so far, given his adherence to routine, it seems unlikely that Charlie would initiate an entire bike ride on his own, as he's so used to Jim being with him at every stage of his bike rides. While Charlie did take the car key once, he left it in the car door (overnight, as I recall----yikes), rather than trying it out in the ignition. (That would have been double yikes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaver's story and Charlie's riding further ahead of Jim remind me these two boys, and many children like them, are growing up. And with growing up comes a greater desire for independence, for doing things on one's own----and yet, certainly for children with the challenges of my son, "doing things one one's own" is a limited proposition, especially when those things involve being out in the community. "Independence" for Charlie isn't going to mean quite what it does for many, but that doesn't mean the urge in him to "do it on by himself" is any less.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241379282600"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stolen_dynavox_safeguarding_communication">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f5d7a27e4c0bf33</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Stolen Dynavox &amp;amp; Safeguarding Communication</title><published>2009-05-03T01:27:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-03T01:27:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stolen_dynavox_safeguarding_communication" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://depts.washington.edu/augcomm/images_aac/dynavox_3100.jpg" height="180" alt="Dynavox from http://depts.washington.edu/augcomm/images_aac/dynavox_3100.jpg" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="220"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We've written quite a bit about assistive technology and its numerous, potential benefits. While my son currently does not have one, the use of an augmentative communication device for him has brought up repeatedly, due to his limited speech. Currently, he does well enough talking. Another technological device come with benefits, for sure, but also new problems: We've been through a couple of iPods and iPod cases, and things get dropped, thrown, cast upon the lawn, left behind. Charlie brings his iPod to school (it's in the plans to teach him to put on his headphones and turn on the iPod when another student is vocalizing loudly or crying----this has been a long-time reason for him getting upset) and sometimes it hasn't made it into his bookbag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8-year-old Casey Duncan's &lt;a href="http://www.dynavoxtech.com/"&gt;Dynavox&lt;/a&gt; was stolen from his mother's car in Liberty City, East Texas, last Wednesday, today's &lt;a href="http://www.tylerpaper.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090502/NEWS01/905020326"&gt;Typer Paper&lt;/a&gt; reports. Angel Duncan had saved for four years to purchase the device; Casey had had his Dynavox for only a year. Duncan thinks that thieves who stole it may have through the Dynavox---left in her car overnight as part of her son's routine---may have thought it was a laptop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just hope they read this and turn it in somewhere, or a pawnshop realizes what it is and contacts law enforcement. He is really lost without it," [Duncan] said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Duncan said even if she orders another device, delivery would take at least six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wish we could just get it back. It is not about the monetary aspect of it, but what it means to him. He has been unhappy since it was stolen. All he did today is write on his board that he was sad," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Casey's Dynavox home-----I'll admit this case makes me think twice about technology (for the time being) and certainly of the need to take a lot of precautions. Communication by any means is a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/communication_is_not_speech_is_a_civil_right"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;(following up on Dora's post earlier today) and we need to safeguard it, legally and literally.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241378789369"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/may_entertainments.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/396c5b1b058f69ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Tree House Ruins"/><title type="html">May Entertainments</title><published>2009-05-03T20:20:21Z</published><updated>2009-05-03T20:20:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/2RFY7NjdqRY/may_entertainments.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/may_entertainments.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/05/may_entertainments/P1010078lores.JPG" width="500" height="418" alt="P1010078lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:80%"&gt;One of these men is an extremely zany comics artist and celebrated wit. The other is a stuffy scholar in an abstruse field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had a three-day holiday thanks to Friday being 1 May -- a red-letter day in Sweden since 1939. Here's the entertainments I've enjoyed.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Went with wife &amp;amp; kids to the local Walpurgis Night bonfire, met loads of neighbours old and new.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played &lt;em&gt;Abalone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tigris &amp;amp; Euphrates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Qwirkle&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="http://pointlessanecdotes.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt; and other friends.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to a lovely dinner at the home of my friends Mattias &amp;amp; Lina.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took a morning bike ride and walk in the woods to log a geocache that had appeared near my home.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kaptenstofil.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kapten Stofil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tenth anniversary event, met comic artists Joakim Lindengren, &lt;a href="http://davidnessle.wordpress.com/"&gt;David Nessle&lt;/a&gt; and Camilla Forsman and off-beat culture historian Martin Kristenson. All a great pleasure to meet, and I was particularly pleased to meet Nessle who, apart from creating achingly funny comics, is also one of the Swedish language's wittiest bloggers. I have of course been a Lindengren fan for over 20 years.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left the kids with the &lt;a href="http://graa-roed.blogspot.com/"&gt;world's best ex-wife&lt;/a&gt;, drove with the world's best wife to &lt;a href="http://www.dufweholm.se/index.asp"&gt;Duveholm&lt;/a&gt; manor near Katrineholm. Had tea, took a long walk among the anemones and over to the next manor over, Djulöholm, saw an abandoned tree-house, had a fine four-course dinner, slept well, had a good breakfast, took another walk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drove to Eskilstuna prompted by &lt;i&gt;The White Guide&lt;/i&gt;, was not terribly impressed by the food at the recommended restaurant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drove to historical author friends &lt;a href="http://www.nok.se/Forfattare/s/Svensson-Kristina/"&gt;Kristina&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.historiskamedia.se/o.o.i.s?id=210&amp;amp;author_id=830"&gt;Bo&lt;/a&gt; in rural Vallentuna, had canapés, admired the resplendent birthday girl and their new house.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three recent news items about chiropractic have particularly irritated me.&lt;br&gt;
(1)&lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;amp;newsId=20090430006527&amp;amp;newsLang=en"&gt; U.S. Army Brigadier General Becky Halstead (Retired) Speaks Out for Chiropractic Care&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;(2) &lt;a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/149071"&gt;Chiropractic Helps Child with Brain Disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(3) &lt;a href="http://www.planetc1.com/cgi-bin/n/v.cgi?c=1&amp;amp;amp;id=1240864592"&gt;Swine Flu Chiropractor’s Handout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) General Halstead has become a spokesperson for The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing public awareness of chiropractic. Her quoted comments boil down to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I like the personal attention and caring I get from my chiropractor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chiropractic advice about healthy lifestyle is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chiropractic care prevents more serious health concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chiropractic is essential for assisting in recovery from minor injuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chiropractors don’t mask the problem with drugs and all their side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Chiropractors are holistic and involve the patient in her own care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “Listening appears to be a major tool.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing but opinion based on personal experience and scientific ignorance. She offers no evidence that chiropractic theory is true, that chiropractic adjustments are effective, or that a chiropractor has any advantage over a science-based medical doctor who also spends time listening to patients, is interested in the whole patient, advises about healthy lifestyle, and avoids unnecessary use of drugs. Caring clinicians can be found in chiropractic, in homeopathy, in every kind of quackery, and in scientific medicine, with the advantage that the scientific clinician can also provide effective evidence-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a woman and a retired Air Force colonel, I am doubly ashamed that this high-ranking military woman has prostituted herself by becoming a spokesperson for pseudoscience. I hope they are paying her well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) The &lt;a href="http://www.atypon-link.com/MCY/doi/abs/10.5555/pmfh.2009.2009.1.1e"&gt;“research,” reported in the Journal of Pediatric, Maternal &amp;amp; Family Health – Chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;, is not really what I would call research. It describes a case of a child with cerebellar ataxia whose problems completely resolved following four chiropractic adjustments. The report speculates that “the increase in the diagnosis of such disorders as ADHD, pervasive developmental disorder, Tourette’s Syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders, have their root in abnormal spinal development.” “Children’s nervous systems need the constant stimulation of movement in order to develop and function properly. Abnormal position or movement of the spinal vertebra can develop and this can lead to nerve interference. It is this interference, called vertebral subluxations, that chiropractors correct.” Maybe, but these subluxations have never been shown to exist outside the imagination of chiropractors, and the alleged nerve interference has never been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t access the entire article without paying $50, but the abstract raised a lot of questions. A seven year old girl “presented for chiropractic care and cerebellar ataxia was noted.” Was this an incidental observation by the chiropractor, or had the child been previously diagnosed with documented ataxia? The chiropractor’s exam “isolated the location of trans-neuronal dysfunction to the right cerebellum.” How? What does “trans-neuronal dysfunction” even mean? Even the grammar is faulty: “Chiropractic analysis of static and motion palpation were used to examine the spine for subluxations.” The wording makes it unclear what the treatment was: adjustments were given “in either the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and/or pelvic region as needed. Neuro-rehabilitative exercises were given either at home and/or during the office visit.” “Within four visits there was marked improvement of gait patterns and resolution of the ataxia.” Really? Or did the chiropractor and parents simply convince themselves they saw improvement? Was cerebellar ataxia really there in the first place? Did a medical doctor confirm the diagnosis? Was there any long-term followup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract’s conclusion is propaganda, not a conclusion based on the study. It consists of speculation that is in no way justified by the data. “Understanding and applying foundational neurological principles via a patient specific, individually tailored, chiropractic management plan is essential. Assessing and optimizing asymmetrical neurological indicators should be part of screening and management procedures. In this case, addressing the dysfunction concerning the central integrative state of the cerebellum was necessary for optimum functioning of this seven-year-old female.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a case report, little more than a testimonial. I hope the body of the article clarifies some of the questions the abstract raises, but I have seen many, many similar chiropractic case reports that are poorly documented, that mix treatments so it is impossible to determine what caused the improvement, and that are eminently unconvincing. The value of case reports is that they can help guide future research. This seldom happens in chiropractic; there is no progress over time, and reports like this do not build into a coherent body of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Nicoleta Borcean, has no articles listed either on PubMed or in the Index to Chiropractic Literature. The journal this article was published in is a brand-new one, and I question both its concept and its editorial board. Why do we need a journal of “Pediatric, Maternal &amp;amp; Family Health- Chiropractic”? There is no evidence that chiropractic has any role in pediatric or maternal health, and the attempt of some chiropractors to become “family doctors” is misguided. The editor in chief is a professor at &lt;a href="http://www.healthwatcher.net/chirowatch.com/Chiro-schools/Life/macon020907lifedenied.html"&gt;Life University, a scandal-ridden school &lt;/a&gt;that was denied recertification in 2002 because it offered substandard education. One editorial board member is Barbara Loe Fisher, Co-Founder &amp;amp; President of the National Vaccine Information Center – an anti-vaccine organization. Other board members are associated with the Academy of Chiropractic Family Practice and the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, organizations whose raison d’être is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not making an ad hominem argument. I’m not saying these individuals couldn’t produce a high-quality journal. But in this case, they haven’t; and their background helps explain why. The abstracts in the current issue are all case reports similar to the ataxia one. “I treated a patient and he got better” is meaningless unless you can show that you’re not making a post hoc ergo propter hoc error. The journal appears to be more interested in finding evidence to support chiropractic claims than in doing good science to test whether chiropractic claims are true. Pseudoscience tries to show “that” a treatment works; real science asks “if” it really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Chiropractors were among the first alternative providers to jump on the Swine Flu bandwagon. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/538-chiropractics-answer-to-swine-flu-get-adjusted.html"&gt;I already wrote about this for Swift&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll repeat it here. Their handout boils down to 6 recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your immune system by getting adjusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the amount of sugar in your diet because sugar depresses the immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid alcohol and white flour products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink more water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disinfect your rooms by spraying them with a solution of essential oils (4 drops to one cup of water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey! One out of six isn’t bad. Handwashing is a good idea. The rest of this advice is useless for preventing infection.&lt;br&gt;
They tell us “Studies show that being adjusted twice a week can increase your immune system function by up to 400%.” No they don’t. I couldn’t find even one such study. I did find a reference to “preliminary research” – apparently not published – that allegedly showed that patients who had received long term chiropractic care had 200% greater immune competence than patients who had not received chiropractic care and 400% greater than those who had cancer. This is uninterpretable because we are not told how the data were collected nor how “immune competence” was measured. Maybe sicker people are already seeing MDs and are less likely to see chiropractors. Besides which, the damage from flu is due to the immune response, and it’s conceivable that increasing immune competence might be harmful.&lt;br&gt;
There is NO credible evidence that chiropractic adjustments decrease the risk of catching ANYTHING. Ditto sugar, white flour and alcohol (unless perhaps indirectly due to secondary effects of overindulgence). Drinking more water? No evidence. And spraying dilute essential oils is probably as effective as having a witch doctor wave a bone and chant.&lt;br&gt;
Chiropractic may help some people with musculoskeletal pain, but reading news items like these doesn’t help my blood pressure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, there's the Doctor Syntax Hotel (and bar) in Sandy Bay, Tasmania (suggested by Alan Walker and depicted below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/DoctorSyntaxHotel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/DoctorSyntaxHotel.jpg" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to find out where the name comes from, but I'm still looking. The hotel has no e-mail address, and I'm not willing to phone Australia, so it might be a while before I get the information by ordinary mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are various X bars (or XBARs, or X-Bars). There's an upscale X bar in the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles. Its publicity describes it as "refreshing, delicious, and saucy" and offers you an opportunity to "recline under the stars in a canopied daybed", suggesting that the X in the name is supposed to suggest sexiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Language Log reader sent me a photo of an X bar in the Bronx (off I-87), but it was taken on a cellphone through a bus window, and its quality is decidedly subpar, though the name of the bar is clear enough. It looks like there are, or have been, more than one dance club called "X bar" in the Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection to linguistics is through what's called "X-bar syntax" or "X-bar theory" (Wikipedia page &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). (As an aside: the functions of the letter X in English expressions are extraordinarily multifarious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Outside the world of linguistic terminology: Jonathan Lundell wrote to savor the name of a hotel in Oakland when he lived there, some years ago: the Hotel Coit (now the Davis-Coit Apartments), with a good Bay Area name (on Lillie Hitchcock Coit, see &lt;a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/h-coit.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that is, however, sexually suggestive (as is, famously, Coit Tower). There's a Coit Tower Hotel in San Francisco, close to the tower, but somehow "Hotel Coit" sounds better than "Coit Hotel".]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241369424258"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b2684f1d11c3d07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="Michael Marmot"/><category term="RCT"/><category term="WCRF"/><category term="cancer"/><category term="causality"/><category term="cohort"/><category term="nutribollocks"/><category term="nutrition"/><category term="randomisation"/><category term="randomization"/><category term="antioxidant"/><category term="Ronald Fisher"/><title type="html">Diet and health.

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago just about every newspaper carried a story much like this one &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583396/Sausage-a-day-can-increase-bowel-cancer-risk.html"&gt;in the Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt; Sausage a day can increase bowel cancer risk &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor Last Updated: 1:55AM BST 31/03/2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating one sausage or three rashers of bacon a day can increase the risk of bowel cancer by a fifth, a medical expert has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sausage-telegraph-660683a-s.jpg" width="240" height="157"&gt;
  	 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan="2"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning involved only 1.8oz (50g) of processed meat daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recommended that people eat less than 17.6 oz of cooked red meat a week and avoid all processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Researchers found that almost half of cancers could be prevented with lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet, using sunscreen, not smoking and limiting  alcohol intake. 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, I wondered, was the evidence behind these dire warnings.    They did not come from a lifestyle guru, a diet faddist or a supplement salesman.  This is nothing to do with quackery. The numbers come from the 2007 report of the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research, with the title ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf"&gt;Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective&lt;/a&gt;‘. This is a 537 page report with over 4,400 references. Its panel was chaired  by &lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology/people/marmotm.htm"&gt;Professor Sir Michael Marmot&lt;/a&gt;, UCL’s professor of Epidemiology and Public Health.  He is a distinguished epidemiologist, renowned for his work on the relation between poverty and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless there has never been a randomised trial to test the carcinogenicity of bacon, so it seems reasonable to ask how strong is the evidence that you shouldn’t eat it?  It turns out to be surprisingly flimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In praise of randomisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Everyone knows about the problem of causality in principle. &lt;em&gt;Post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/em&gt;; confusion of sequence and consequence; confusion of correlation and cause. This is not a trivial problem. It is probably the main reason why ineffective treatments often appear to work. It is traded on by the vast and unscrupulous alternative medicine industry. It is, very probably, the reason why we are bombarded every day with conflicting advice on what to eat. This is a bad thing, for two reasons. First, we end up confused about what we should eat. But worse still, the conflicting nature of the advice gives science as a whole a bad reputation. Every time a white-coated scientist appears in the media to tell us that a glass of wine per day is good/bad for us (delete according to the phase of the moon) the general public just laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of sausages and bacon, suppose that there is a correlation between eating them and developing colorectal cancer. How do we know that it was eating the bacon that caused the cancer – that the relationship is causal?  The answer is that there is no way to be sure if we have simply observed the association.  It could always be that the sort of people who eat bacon are also the sort of people who get colorectal cancer.  But the question of causality is absolutely crucial, because if it is not causal, then stopping eating bacon won’t reduce your risk of cancer.  The recommendation to avoid all processed meat in the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf"&gt;WCRF report (2007)&lt;/a&gt; is sensible &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the relationship is causal. &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell"&gt;Barker Bausell &lt;/a&gt;said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [Page39] “But why should nonscientists care one iota about something as esoteric as causal inference? I believe that the answer to this question is because the making of causal inferences is part of our job description as Homo Sapiens.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be the mantra of every health journalist, and every newspaper reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential basis for causal inference was established over 70 years ago by that giant of statistics Ronald Fisher, and that basis is randomisation.  Its first popular exposition was in Fisher’s famous book, The Design of Experiments (1935).  The Lady Tasting Tea has become the  classical example of how to design an experiment.  .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/fisher-2s.jpg"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, a lady claims to be able to tell whether the milk was put in the cup before or after the tea was poured.  Fisher points out that to test this you need to present the lady with an equal number of cups that are ‘milk first’ or ‘tea first’ (but otherwise indistinguishable) &lt;em&gt;in random order&lt;/em&gt;, and count how many she gets right.  There is a beautiful analysis of it in Stephen Senn’s book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dicing-Death-Chance-Risk-Health/dp/0521540232"&gt; Dicing with Death: Chance, Risk and Health&lt;/a&gt;. As it happens, Google books has the whole of the relevant section &lt;a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DaLtBMu453EC&amp;amp;pg=PA54&amp;amp;dq=Fishers+tea+test+Senn&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;Fisher’s tea test&lt;/a&gt; (geddit?),   but buy the book anyway.  Such is the fame of this example that it was used as the title of a book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized/dp/0805071342"&gt;The Lady Tasting Tea &lt;/a&gt;was published by David Salsburg (my &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Lady%20tasting%20tea.pdf"&gt;review of it is here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most studies of diet and health fall into one of three types,  case-control studies, cohort (or prospective) studies, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"&gt;randomised controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; (RCTs).  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"&gt;Case-control studies&lt;/a&gt; are the least satisfactory: they look at people who already have the disease and look back to see how they differ from similar people who don’t have the disease. They are retrospective.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_studies"&gt;Cohort studies&lt;/a&gt; are better because they are prospective: a large group of people is followed for a long period and their health and diet is recorded and later their disease and death is recorded.   But in both sorts of studies,each person decides for him/herself what to eat or what drugs to take.  Such studies can never demonstrate causality, though if the effect is really big (like cigarette-smoking and lung cancer) they can give a very good indication.  The difference in an RCT is that each person does not choose what to eat, but their diet is allocated randomly to them by someone else. This means that,  on average, all other factors that might influence the response are balanced equally between the two groups. Only RCTs can demonstrate causality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomisation is a rather beautiful idea.  It allows one to remove, in a statistical sense, bias that might result from all the sources that you hadn’t realised were there.  If you are aware of a source of bias, then measure it.  The danger arises from the things you don’t know about, or can’t measure (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/senn-2004.pdf"&gt;Senn, 2004&lt;/a&gt;;  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dicing-Death-Chance-Risk-Health/dp/0521540232"&gt; Senn, 2003&lt;/a&gt;).  Although it guarantees freedom from bias only in a long run statistical sense, that is the best that can be done. Everything else is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Goldacre has referred memorably to the newspapers’ ongoing “Sisyphean task of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or cure cancer” (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/19/cancer.foodtech"&gt;Goldacre, 2008&lt;/a&gt;).  This has even given rise to a blog. “&lt;a href="http://thedailymailoncologicalontologyproject.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Daily Mail Oncological Ontology Project&lt;/a&gt;“.  The problem arises in assessing causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be so bad if the problem were restricted to the media.  It is much more worrying that the problem of establishing causality often seems to be underestimated by the authors of papers themselves. It is a matter of speculation why this happens. Part of the reason is, no doubt, a genuine wish to discover something that will benefit mankind. But it is hard not to  think that hubris and self-promotion may  also play a role. Anything whatsoever that purports to relate diet to health is guaranteed to get uncritical newspaper headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the problem lies the great difficulty in doing randomised studies of the effect of diet and health.  There can be no better illustration of the vital importance of randomisation than in this field.  And, notwithstanding the generally uncritical reporting of stories about diet and health, one of the best accounts of the need for randomisation was written by a journalist, Gary Taubes, and it appeared in the New York Times (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/taubes-HRT-nyt.pdf"&gt;Taubes, 2007&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The case of hormone replacement therapy &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was recommended not only to relieve the unpleasant symptoms of the menopause, but also because cohort studies suggested that HRT would reduce heart disease and osteoporosis in older women.  For these reasons, by 2001, 15 million US women (perhaps 5 million older women) were taking HRT (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/taubes-HRT-nyt.pdf"&gt;Taubes, 2007&lt;/a&gt;). These recommendations were based largely on the Harvard Nurses’ Study. This was a prospective cohort study in which 122,000 nurses were followed over time, starting in 1976 (these are the ones who responded out of the 170,000 requests sent out).  In 1994, it was said (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Manson_1994_American-Heart-Journal.pdf"&gt;Manson, 1994&lt;/a&gt;) that nearly all of the more than 30 observational studies suggested a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) among women receiving oestrogen therapy.  A meta-analysis gave an estimated 44% reduction of CHD.  Although warnings were given about the lack of randomised studies, the results were nevertheless acted upon as though they were true.  But they were wrong.  When proper randomised studies were done, not only did it turn out that CHD was not reduced: it was actually increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women’s Health Initiative Study (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/whi-study-hrt-jama-2002.pdf"&gt;Rossouw et al., 2002&lt;/a&gt;) was a randomized double blind trial on 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years and its results contradicted the conclusions from all the earlier cohort studies.  HRT increased risks of heart disease,  stroke, blood clots, breast cancer (though possibly helped with osteoporosis  and perhaps colorectal cancer). After an average 5.2 years of follow-up, the trial was stopped because of the apparent increase in breast cancer in the HRT group. The relative risk (HRT relative to placebo) of CHD was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.63) (286 cases altogether) and for breast  cancer 1.26 (1.00 -1.59) (290 cases). Rather than there being a 44% reduction of risk, it seems that there was actually a 30% increase in risk. Notice that these are actually quite small risks, and on the margin of statistical significance. For the purposes of communicating the nature of the risk to an individual person it is usually better to specify the absolute risk rather than relative risk. The absolute number of CHD cases per 10,000 person-years is about 29 on placebo and 36 on HRT, so the increased risk of any individual is quite small. Multiplied over the whole population though, the number is no longer small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several plausible reasons for these contradictory results are discussed  by &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/taubes-HRT-nyt.pdf"&gt;Taubes,(2007)&lt;/a&gt;: it seems that women who choose to take HRT are healthier than those who don’t.  In fact the story has become a bit more complicated since  then: the effect of HRT depends on when it is started and on how long it is taken (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Vandenbroucke_2009_The-Lancet.pdf"&gt;Vandenbroucke, 2009&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps one of the most dramatic illustrations of the value of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Reliance on observations of correlations suggested a 44% reduction in CHD, the randomised trial gave a 30% increase in CHD.  Insistence on randomisation is not just pedantry. It is essential if you want to get the right answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having dealt with the cautionary tale of HRT, we can now get  back to the ‘Sisyphean task of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or cure cancer’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The case of processed meat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf"&gt;WCRF report (2007)&lt;/a&gt; makes some pretty firm recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get overweight &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be moderately physically active, equivalent to brisk walking for at least 30 minutes every day &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume energy-dense foods sparingly. Avoid sugary drinks. Consume ‘fast foods’ sparingly, if at all &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat at least five portions/servings (at least 400 g or 14 oz) of a variety of non-starchy vegetables and of fruits every day. Eat relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) with every meal. Limit refined starchy foods &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who eat red meat to consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, very little if any to be processed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If alcoholic drinks are consumed, limit consumption to no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid salt-preserved, salted, or salty foods; preserve foods without using salt. Limit consumption of processed foods with added salt to ensure an intake of less than 6 g (2.4 g sodium) a day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all sound pretty sensible but they are very prescriptive. And of course the recommendations make sense &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; insofar as the various dietary factors &lt;em&gt;cause &lt;/em&gt; cancer. If the association is not causal, changing your diet won’t help. Note that dietary supplements are NOT recommended. I’ll concentrate on the evidence that lies behind “People who . . . very little if any to be processed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of establishing causality is dicussed in the report in detail. In section 3.4 the report says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” . . . causal relationships between food and nutrition, and physical activity can be confidently inferred when epidemiological evidence, and experimental and other biological findings, are consistent, unbiased, strong, graded, coherent,  repeated, and plausible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of processed meat is dealt with in chapter 4.3 (p. 148) of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Processed meats” include sausages and frankfurters, and ‘hot dogs’, to which nitrates/nitrites or other preservatives are added, are also processed meats.  Minced meats sometimes, but not always, fall inside this definition if they are preserved chemically. The same point applies to ‘hamburgers’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for harmfulness of processed meat was described as “convincing”, and this is the highest level of confidence in the report, though this conclusion has been challenged (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/truswell-on-marmot.pdf"&gt;Truswell, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well does the evidence obey the criteria for the relationship being causal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve prospective cohort studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest, though this was statistically significant in only three of them. One study reported non-significant decreased risk and one study reported that there was no effect on risk. These results are summarised  in this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_plot"&gt;forest plot&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Lewis-Clarke-Forest-plots-BMJ-2001.pdf"&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark, 2001&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/marmot-fig-4-3-5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each line represents a separate study.  The size of the square represents the precision (weight) for each.  The horizontal bars show the 95% &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"&gt;confidence intervals&lt;/a&gt;. If it were possible to repeat the observations many times on the same population, the 95% CL would be different on each repeat experiment, but 19 out of 20 (95%) of the intervals would contain the true value (and 1 in 20 would not contain the true value).  If the bar does not overlap the vertical line at relative risk = 1 (i.e. no effect) this is equivalent to saying that there is a statistically significant difference from 1 with &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.  That means, very roughly, that there is a 1 in 20 chance  of making a fool of yourself if you claim that the association is real, rather than being a result of chance (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"&gt;more detail here&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a tendency for the relative risks to be above one, though  not by much,  Pooling the results sounds like a good idea. The method for doing this is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis was possible on five studies, shown below.  The outcome is shown by the red diamond at the bottom, labelled “summary effect”, and the width of the diamond indicates the 95% confidence interval.  In this case the final result for association between processed meat intake and colorectal cancer was a relative risk of 1.21 (95% CI 1.04–1.42) per 50 g/day. This is presumably where the headline value of a 20% increase in risk came from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/marmot-fig-4-3-6.jpg" width="500" height="339"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support came from a meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies, which reported a relative risk for processed meat of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 – 1.13) per 30 g/day (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/larsson-wolk-2006.pdf"&gt;Larsson &amp;amp; Wolk, 2006&lt;/a&gt;). Since then another study has come up with similar numbers (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/meat-and%20mortality-Sinha-2009.pdf"&gt;Sinha &lt;em&gt;etal. &lt;/em&gt;, 2009&lt;/a&gt;). This consistency suggests a real association, but it cannot be taken as evidence for causality.   Observational  studies on HRT were just as consistent, but they were wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accompanying editorial (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/popkin-meat-editorial-AIM-2009.pdf"&gt;Popkin, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) points out that there are rather more important reasons to limit meat consumption, like the environmental footprint of most meat production, water supply, deforestation and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the outcome from vast numbers of observations is an association that only just reaches the &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05 level of statistical significance. But even if the association is real, not a result of chance sampling error, that doesn’t help in the least in establishing causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two more criteria that might help, a good relationship between dose and response, and a plausible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dose – response relationship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite possible to observe a very convincing relationship between dose and response in epidemiological studies,  The relationship between number of cigarettes smoked per day and the incidence of lung cancer is one example.  Indeed it is almost the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/doll-peto-1978-fig1-vs.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/doll-peto-1978.pdf"&gt;Doll &amp;amp; Peto, 1978&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been six studies that relate consumption of processed meat to incidence of colorectal cancer.  All six dose-reponse relationships are shown in the WCRG report. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/marmot-fig-4-3-7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/marmot-fig-4-3-8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point where my credulity begins to get strained.  Dose – response curves are part of the stock in trade of pharmacologists.  The technical description of these six curves is, roughly, ‘bloody horizontal’.  The report says “A dose-response relationship was also apparent from cohort studies that measured consumption in times/day”.  I simply cannot agree that any relationship whatsoever is “apparent”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; They are certainly the least convincing dose-response relationships I have ever seen. Nevertheless a meta-analysis came up with a slope for response curve that &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; reached the 5% level of statistical significance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The conclusion of the report for processed meat and colorectal cancer was as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a substantial amount of evidence, with a dose-response relationship apparent from cohort studies.  There is strong evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. Processed meat is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the dose-response curves look appalling, and it is reasonable to ask whether public policy should be based on a 1 in 20 chance of being quite wrong (1 in 20 at best –see &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/senn-on-ioannidis-2008.pdf"&gt;Senn, 2008&lt;/a&gt;).  I certainly wouldn’t want to risk my reputation on odds like that, never mind use it as a basis for public policy.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are left with plausibility as the remaining bit of evidence for causality. Anyone who has done much experimental work knows that it is possible to dream up a plausible explanation of any result whatsoever. Most are wrong and so plausibility is a pretty weak argument. Much play is made of the fact that cured meats contain nitrates and nitrites, but there is no real evidence that the amount they contain is harmful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main source of nitrates in the diet is not from meat but from vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach) which contribute 70 – 90% of total intake.  The maximum legal content in processed meat is 10 – 25 mg/100g, but lettuce contains around 100 – 400 mg/100g with a legal limit of 200 – 400 mg/100g.  Dietary nitrate intake was not associated with risk for colorectal cancer in two cohort studies.(&lt;a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/nitrates.pdf"&gt;Food Standards Agency, 2004&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Meetings/94-nitratenitrite.pdf"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add further to the confusion, another cohort study on over 60,000 people compared vegetarians and meat-eaters. Mortality from circulatory diseases and mortality from all causes were not detectably different between vegetarians and meat eaters (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Key2-ajcn.2009.26736Mv1.pdf"&gt;Key &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2009a&lt;/a&gt;). Still more confusingly, although the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat eaters, the exception was colorectal cancer which had a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; incidence in vegetarians than in meat eaters (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Key-ajcn.2009.26736Lv1.pdf"&gt;Key &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 2009b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/mente-aim-2009.pdf"&gt;Mente et al. (2009)&lt;/a&gt; compared cohort studies and RCTs for effects of diet on risk of coronary heart disease.  “Strong evidence” for protective effects was found  for intake of vegetables, nuts, and “Mediterranean diet”, and harmful effects of intake of trans–fatty acids and foods with a high glycaemic index. There was also a bit less strong evidence for effects of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and for intake of fish, marine ω-3 fatty acids, folate, whole grains, dietary vitamins E and C, beta carotene, alcohol, fruit, and fibre.  But RCTs showed evidence &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for “Mediterranean diet”, and for &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final nail in the coffin of case control studies, consider pizza.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Vecchia-pizza-2006.pdf"&gt;La Vecchia &amp;amp; Bosetti (2006)&lt;/a&gt;,  data from a series of case control studies in northern Italy lead to: “An inverse association was found between regular pizza consumption (at least one portion of pizza per week) and the risk of cancers of the digestive tract, with relative risks of 0.66 for oral and pharyngeal cancers, 0.41 for oesophageal, 0.82 for laryngeal,  0.74 for colon and 0.93 for rectal cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What on earth is one meant to make of this?    Pizza should be prescribable on the National Health Service to produce a 60% reduction in oesophageal cancer?   As the authors say “pizza may simply represent a general and aspecific indicator of a favourable Mediterranean diet.”  It is observations like this that seem to make a mockery of making causal inferences from non-randomised studies. They are simply uninterpretable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is the observed association even real?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable thing about the effects of red meat and processed meat is not only that they are small but also that they only just reach the 5 percent level of statistical significance. It has been explained clearly why, in these circumstances, real associations are likely to be exaggerated in size (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/ioannidis-associations-2008.pdf"&gt;Ioannidis, 2008a&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-amer-j-epidemiol-2008.pdf"&gt;Ioannidis, 2008b&lt;/a&gt;;   &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/senn-on-ioannidis-2008.pdf"&gt;Senn, 2008&lt;/a&gt;). Worse still, there as some good reasons to think that many (perhaps even most) of the effects that are claimed in this sort of study are not real anyway (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-plos-2005.pdf"&gt;Ioannidis, 2005&lt;/a&gt;).  The inflation of the strength of associations is expected to be  bigger in small studies, so it is noteworthy that the large meta-analysis by &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/larsson-wolk-2006.pdf"&gt;Larsson &amp;amp; Wolk, 2006&lt;/a&gt;  comments “In  the present meta-analysis, the magnitude of the relationship of processed meat consumption with colorectal cancer risk was weaker than in the earlier meta-analyses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all consistent with the well known tendency of randomized clinical trials to show initially a good effect of treatment but subsequent trials tend to show smaller effects.  The reasons, and the cures, for this worrying problem are discussed by Chalmers (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/chalmers-Optimism%20bias-2006.pdf"&gt;Chalmers, 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/chalmers-matthews-lancet-2006.pdf"&gt;Chalmers &amp;amp; Matthews, 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/garattini-chalmers-bmj-2009.pdf"&gt;Garattini &amp;amp; Chalmers, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do randomized studies tell us?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only form of reliable evidence for causality comes from randomised controlled trials. The difficulties in allocating people to diets over long periods of time are obvious and that is no doubt one reason why there are far fewer RCTs than there are observational studies. But when they have been done the results often contradict those from cohort studies. The RCTs of hormone replacement therapy mentioned above contradicted the cohort studies and reversed the advice given to women about HRT.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more illustrations of how plausible suggestions about diet can be refuted by RCTs concern nutritional supplements and weight-loss diets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many RCTs have shown that various forms of nutritional supplement do no good and may even do harm (see &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/dd89j7"&gt;Cochrane reviews&lt;/a&gt;).  At least we now know that anti-oxidants per se do you no good. The idea that anti-oxidants might be good for you was never more than a plausible hypothesis, and like so many plausible hypotheses it has turned out to be a myth. The word anti-oxidant is now no more than a marketing term, though it remains very profitable for unscrupulous salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The randomised  Women’s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/prentice-whi-diet-2007.pdf"&gt;Prentice &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 2007&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/prentice-2007.pdf"&gt;Prentice, 2007&lt;/a&gt;)  showed minimal effects of dietary fat on cancer, though the conclusion has   been challenged on the basis of the possible inaccuracy of reported diet  (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Yngve-whi-crit-2007.pdf"&gt;Yngve &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;,  2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to much dogma about weight loss (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/sacks-diet-nejm-2009.pdf"&gt;Sacks &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2009&lt;/a&gt;) found no differences in weight loss over two years between four very different diets.  They assigned randomly 811 overweight adults to one of four diets. The percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%.  No difference could be detected between the different diets: all that mattered for weight loss was the total number of calories.  It should be added, though, that there were some reasons to think that the participants may not have stuck to their diets very well (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/katan-editorial-on-sacks-2009-nejm.pdf"&gt;Katan, 2009&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impression one gets from RCTs is that the details of diet are not anything like as important as has been inferred from non-randomised observational studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So does processed meat give you cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, we can return to the original question. Do sausages or bacon give you colorectal cancer? The answer, sadly, is that nobody really knows.  I do know that, on the basis of the evidence, it seems to me to be an exaggeration  to assert that “The evidence is convincing that processed meat is a cause of  bowel cancer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK there were around &lt;a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/bowel/incidence/"&gt;5 cases of colorectal cancer per 10,000 population&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, so a 20% increase, even if it were real, and genuinely causative. would result in 6 rather than 5 cases per 10,000 people, annually. That makes the risk sound trivial for any individual. On the other hand there were 36,766 cases of colorectal cancer in the UK in 2005. A 20% increase would mean, if the association were causal, about 7000 extra cases as a result of eating processed meat, but no extra cases if the association were not causal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of public health policy about diet, the question of causality is crucial.  One has sympathy for the difficult decisions that they have to make, because they are forced to decide on the basis of inadequate evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were not already obvious, the examples discussed above make it very clear that the only sound guide to causality is a properly randomised trial. The only exceptions to that are when effects are really big. The relative risk of lung cancer for a heavy cigarette smoker is 20 times that of a non-smoker and there is a very clear relationship between dose (cigarettes per day) and response (lung cancer incidence), as shown above. That is a 2000% increase in risk, very different from the 20% found for processed meat (and many other dietary effects). Nobody could doubt seriously the causality in that case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision about whether to eat bacon and sausages has to be a personal one. It depends on your attitude to the precautionary principle. The observations do not, in my view, constitute strong evidence for causality, but they are certainly compatible with causality. It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be true so if you want to be on the safe side then avoid bacon.  Of course life would not be much fun if your actions were based on things that just &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;  be  true.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own inclination would be to ignore any relative risk based on observational data if it was less than about 2. The National Cancer Institute (&lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/benchmarks-vol2-issue7/page2"&gt;Nelson,  2002&lt;/a&gt;)  advises that relative risks less than 2 should be “viewed with caution”, but  fails to explain what “viewing with caution” means in practice, so the advice isn’t very useful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact hardly any of the relative risks reported in the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf"&gt;WCRF report (2007)&lt;/a&gt; reach this level. Almost all relative risks are less than 1.3 (or greater than 0.7 for alleged protective effects). Perhaps it is best to stop worrying and get on with your life. At some point it becomes counterproductive to try to micromanage `people’s diet on the basis of dubious data.  There is a price to pay for being too precautionary.  It runs the risk of making people ignore information that has got a sound basis.  It runs the risk of excessive medicalisation of everyday life.  And it brings science itself into disrepute when people laugh at the contradictory findings of observational epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how diet and other ‘lifestyle interventions’ affect health is fascinating to everyone. There is compelling reason to think that it matters.  For example one study demonstrated that breast cancer incidence increased almost  threefold in first-generation Japanese women who migrated to Hawaii, and up to fivefold in the second generation (Kolonel, 1980). Since then enormous effort  has been put into finding out why. The first great success was cigarette smoking  but that is almost the only major success. Very few similar magic bullets have  come to light after decades of searching (asbestos and mesothelioma, or UV radiation and skin cancer count as successes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf"&gt;WCRF report (2007)&lt;/a&gt; has 537 pages and over 4400 references and we still don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

Speaking about the fundamentalist faith in the Bible or in inerrancy he claims:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout most of history most Christian thinkers would have been seen this view as theological nonsense. Or blasphemy. The Bible was never to be an object of faith. God through Christ was. Being a Christian meant believing in Christ, not believing in the Bible. &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2009/05/do_christians_have_to_believe_in_the_bible.html?hpid=talkbox1"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;David over at the &lt;em&gt;Unreligious Right &lt;/em&gt;Blog says this about Erhman's point:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is also interesting from the atheist perspective, as atheists often attack Christianity by pointing out the many problems with the Bible. Such a line of argument can be effective with Christians who believe in the primacy of Biblical authority, or Biblical inerrancy, but is less compelling to those who hold more liberal versions of Christianity. &lt;a href="http://unreligiousright.blogspot.com/2009/05/radicalism-of-biblical-inerrancy.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree. &lt;strong&gt;That's why my focus is about debunking the ideas that Christians have gained from the Bible rather than the Bible itself.&lt;/strong&gt; Besides, I have reasons for rejecting liberal Christianity as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7282338952528837476?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get ready for the Fifth Annual &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;World Naked Gardening Day (WNGD)! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; People across the globe are encouraged, on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, May 2, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;to tend their portion of the world’s garden clothed as nature intended….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;On May 2, 2009 find an opportunity to get naked and do some gardening. Do so alone, with friends, with family, with your gardening club, or with any other group collected for that purpose.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say it’s more of a WTF than WNGD, but hey, each to their own.  I celebrated by taking a naked shower after my day of clothed gardening. As a pale pasty person, naked gardening = catastrophic sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to imagine some of our &lt;a href="http://web1.msue.msu.edu/mastergardener/michigan_master_gardener_program.htm"&gt;Master Gardeners&lt;/a&gt; having a Naked Gardening Day…nope, does not compute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. Put it on Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=303"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3493891507_5d86830d09.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/multimedia/images_telecon_20090430.html"&gt;This new MESSENGER image of Mercury&lt;/a&gt; was taken when the spacecraft swept past the tiny planet back in October 2008. The big circular feature is the Rembrandt impact basin, which is a ginormous 715 kilometers (440 miles) across. Incredibly, this feature has never been seen before on Mercury! That goes to show you how hard it’s been to study the planet in the past. From Earth, Mercury never gets very high above the horizon so it’s always a fuzzy blob, and previous spacecraft encounters only imaged parts of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/presscon043009/img4.1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/messenger_rembrandt_full.jpg" alt="Head-on view of Rembrandt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rembrandt seen head-on. Colorado&lt;br&gt;would comfortably fit inside it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, sometimes it’s hard to see something that’s really big. I remember standing on the lip of a volcano with a caldera 5 km across, and it was so huge it was hard to tell it was a volcano! In the case of the Rembrandt basin, its location on Mercury, its size, and its somewhat subtle rim made it difficult to see in the past. MESSENGER’s phenomenal cameras, however, were able to catch it in a mosaic of several images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like a relatively young feature given how well-preserved it looks. Yet it still has plenty of craters in it, indicating it’s been around a while at least. Note the inner circle, too: that’s a common feature in huge impact basins like this, and the reasons the mulitple rings form is still being debated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rembrandt is cut by a 1000-km-long scarp on the left — the longest yet seen on Mercury — and also has a series of ridges and troughs in the floor unlike anything seen on Mercury or any other planet. Those are somehow causes by crustal deformation, but the specific mechanism isn’t understood yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine! Here is an entire planet, one of the closer ones in the solar system, and yet it still holds many mysteries… including some so big they are almost literally right in our face, just waiting to be unveiled and understood. What will MESSENGER see in September, on its third pass of the planet? What will it see once it settles into orbit in March 2011?&lt;/p&gt;

Missouri's legislators have just passed a vague law that says pharmacists don't have to fill prescriptions for things that they don't like, especially nothing that might look sorta like an abortifacient. This is a bad law that removes standards of professional conduct from licensed pharmacies, and further removes all liability from pharmacists who disregard the doctor's prescriptions for their patients. Well, some of their standards. Ema has a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing. I have a question for Rep. Ed Emery, Rep. Cynthia Davis, and all the other Missouri politicians who passed HB 226. Since you've removed the professional duty and standard requirements for the sale of drugs, can I haz street stand for the glorious, Capitalist selling of Plan B in your state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But the ways that human languages encourage us to generalize can cause enormous damage to rational thinking, especially in combination with the natural human preference for clear and simple stories over complicated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've cited many examples involving journalists or popular authors, most recently with respect to the effects of poverty on working memory ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1297"&gt;Betting on the poor boy: Whorf strikes back&lt;/a&gt;", 4/5/2009). But in fact, this is a problem that afflicts everyone, even prize-winning behavioral economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;According Daniel Kahneman, "&lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Maps_bounded_rationality_DK_2003.pdf"&gt;Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;The American Economic Review&lt;/em&gt;, 93(5): 1449-1475, 2003 [revised vesion of 2002 Nobel acceptance speech]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Ellen J. Langer et al. (1978) provided a well-known example of what she called “mindless behavior.” In her experiment, a confederate tried to cut in line at a copying machine, using various preset “excuses.” The conclusion was that statements that had the form of an unqualified request were rejected (e.g., “Excuse me, may I use the Xerox machine?”), but almost any statement that had the general form of an explanation was accepted, including “Excuse me, may I use the Xerox machine because I want to make copies?” The superficiality is striking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited paper is Ellen Langer, Arthur Blank and Benzion Chanowitz., "&lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/36/6/635.pdf"&gt;The Mindlessness of Ostensibly Thoughtful Action: The Role of "Placebic" Information in Interpersonal Interaction&lt;/a&gt;", 	&lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, 36(6): 635-42, 1978. I happen to have read the Langer et al. paper recently, due to interest in the history of the notion of "placebic information" (see &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1378"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for what started me off). And for the same reason, I looked through a listing of the papers that cited it, to find other areas where this concept had been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered was frequent misunderstanding of the 1978 paper's results, involving both a different conclusion and a strikingly overgeneralized picture of the observed effects. Kahneman 2003 was merely the most prominent of these. So as part of my on-going exploration of scientific rhetoric, today's post describes what Langer et al. 1978 actually found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langer et al. tell us that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The [line-cutting] study utilized a 3 X 2 factorial design in which the variables of interest were the type of information presented (request; request plus "placebic" information; request plus real information) and the amount of effort compliance entailed (small or large).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount-of-effort variable was a bit complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When a subject approached the copier and placed the material to be copied on the machine, the subject was approached by the experimenter just before he or she deposited the money necessary to begin copying. The subject was then asked to let the experimenter use the machine first to copy either 5 or 20 pages. (The number of pages the experimenter had, in combination with the number of pages the subject had, determined whether the request was small or large. If the subject had more pages to copy than the experimenter, the favor was considered small, and if the subject had fewer pages to copy, the favor was taken to be large).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three types of request were a little simpler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Request only.&lt;/em&gt; "Excuse me, I have S (20) pages. May I use the xerox machine?"&lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;em&gt;Placebic information&lt;/em&gt;. "Excuse me, I have 5 (20) pages. May I use the xerox machine, because I have to make copies?"&lt;br&gt;
3.&lt;em&gt; Real information.&lt;/em&gt; "Excuse me, I have S (20) pages. May I use the xerox machine, because I'm in a rush?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was another independent variable, whose effects are not reported in detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Half of the experimental sessions were conducted by a female who was blind to the experimental hypotheses, and the remaining sessions were run by a male experimenter who knew the hypotheses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're told that "Not surprisingly, the female experimenter had a higher rate of compliance than the male experimenter, but since there were no interactions between this variable and the others', the data are combined in the table for ease of reading."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex aside,  the table of results was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LangerTable1.png" alt="Langer et al. 1978, Table 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest effect by far was the size of the favor: when the experimenter had more pages to copy than the subject ("big favor"), the subject said "no" about 70% of the time; but when the experimenter had fewer pages to copy ("small favor"), the subject said "no" only about 17% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect obviously interacts with the type of request, affirming a central theme discussed in the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[I]t was assumed that people would not behave in this pseudothinking way when responding was potentially effortful. Then, there is sufficient motivation for attention to shift from simple physical characteristics of the message to -the semantic factors, resulting in processing of current information. Thus, it was predicted that as the favor became more demanding, the placebic information group would behave more like the request-only group and differently (yielding a lower rate of compliance) from the real-information group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this worked out almost categorically — in the &amp;quot;small favor&amp;quot; condition, the placebic-information group behaved almost exactly like the real-information group, while in the &amp;quot;big favor&amp;quot; condition, the placebic-information group behaved almost exactly like the request-only group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#39;t the lesson that Prof. Kahneman asks us to draw. He interprets the experiment — or perhaps remembers the experiment — as showing that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;statements that had the form of an unqualified request were rejected (e.g., “Excuse me, may I use the Xerox machine?”), but almost any statement that had the general form of an explanation was accepted, including “Excuse me, may I use the Xerox machine because I want to make copies?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we re-arrange the results according to Kahneman's description, combining the small-favor and big-favor rows, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Request only&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Placebic explanation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sufficient explanation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;0.375&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;0.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;0.628&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it&amp;#39;s not true that &amp;quot;statements that had the form of an unqualified request were rejected&amp;quot; — in fact, they were accepted almost 40% of the time overall, and when the requested favor was small, they were accepted 60% of the time. Nor was it true that &amp;quot;almost any statement that had the general form of an explanation was accepted, including &amp;#39;Excuse me, may I use the Xerox machine because I want to make copies&amp;#39;&amp;quot; — in fact, the placebic requests were rejected 50% of the time overall, and 76% of the time when the requested favor was large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a seminar on experimental design and interpretation, I&amp;#39;d expect the students to pick up a few  problems with the Langer-Blank-Chanowitz experiment taken as a whole. One issue is that the different forms of request are of different lengths, with the &amp;quot;request only&amp;quot; case being shorter.  (And the &amp;quot;placebic&amp;quot; request, in this case, was so moronically self-involved that subjects may have been motivated to grant a small favor out of pity, bemusement, or reluctance to argue with an idiot.)  Another issue is  the status and situation of the subjects — presumably they were a mixture of students, faculty, and secretaries or other administrative workers; and the lower-status subjects might have had a different mix of job sizes,  a different set of time constraints, and a different copying culture. (And of course, we ought in any case to be cautious in drawing conclusions about human nature from the behavior of New York City intellectuals in copier lines…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem with Prof. Kahneman's interpretation is not that he took the experiment at face value, ignoring possible flaws of design or interpretation. The problem is that he took a difference in the distribution of behaviors between one group of people and another, and turned it into generic statements about the behavior of people in specified circumstances, as if the behavior were uniform and invariant. The resulting generic statements make strikingly incorrect predictions even about the results of the experiment in question, much less about life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially ironic given the focus of Prof. Kahneman's own research on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_prospect_theory"&gt;psychological mechanisms that undermine rational choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should stress that I'm not opposed to summarizing and generalizing, and that I'm not trying to call Prof. Kahneman's accomplishments into question. My point is that the habit of thinking accurately about the properties of distributions is a very difficult one to establish and maintain, even in simple cases; slips are common, even among very smart and well-informed people; and the result is often something that "Everyone knows" despite the fact that it isn't true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many science journalists don't even try, and perhaps in some cases don't have the (simple) conceptual training needed to get things straight in the first place. As I've suggested before, this aspect of our culture, from a certain point of view, is &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004992.html"&gt;as puzzling as the Pirahã's lack of interest in counting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[N.B. The line-cutting study was one of three experiments discussed in the 1978 paper, and the subjects are described as "120 adults (68 males and 52 females) who used the copying machine at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York". Since Langer was at Harvard, while Blank and Chanowitz were at CUNY, it would probably be more accurate to attribute this experiment to them rather than to her alone; but such are the perils of authorship order.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241352438719"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9008937186434915801">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ade4e3927514628</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Theistic Evolution: How Does God Do It?</title><published>2009-05-03T10:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-03T11:57:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/theistic-evolution-how-does-god-do-it.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9008937186434915801/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9008937186434915801" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Theistic Evolution is a form of creationism that limits God&amp;#39;s involvement in the creation event.

He kindly allowed me to re-post it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lain awake all night in my bed, my mind processing all I heard or wanted to say at the debate. I was ready to speak up at anytime, but wasn’t directly asked a question. (Mind you, my wife was terrific when she spoke. She’s a wonderful, compassionate and intelligent woman.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter died a horrific death. Moments after she died I held her beaten little body as blood from her double transfusion ran down her arms, onto mine and then the floor. It’s a reality and I ‘know’ it happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died from pertussis, contracted in a region in NSW where 66% of babies are vaccinated. When you combine that with the low adult vaccination rate of 10%(due to people not knowing their booster shots wane after 7 to 10 years), it’s the lowest vaccination rate in Australia, hence one of the most dangerous areas to have a baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana paid the highest price for our ignorance and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSW Health should have proactively alerted the community of outbreaks and precautions to take before it became an epidemic. This requires more than just posters and media releases. We need advertising campaigns supported by vigilant screening, consistent advice from frontline health workers and free boosters for all adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the efforts of a few are futile. Everyone in our community must work together to increase vaccination rates to protect our most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please learn from our past. Vaccination was introduced because there is no medicine to stop these bacteria that killed and maimed thousands of children. Now, these third-world diseases are on the rise again. In NSW it is Whooping Cough. In Queensland it is Measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is the key to saving our babies. You can’t change opinion or inform the community with silence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully…hopefully….. that’s all about to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish with a quote from Queensland Premier Anna Bligh that she made yesterday in a response to the press…..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a mother, I strongly believe in vaccination. I also believe that vaccination is a basic parental responsibility and that governments have an equally important role to play in boosting vaccination rates in the community. I support any national moves to improve vaccination rates and have asked my Deputy Premier and Health Minister Paul Lucas to raise this issue at the next Australian Health Ministers Conference in July.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tourists enjoying a day of sightseeing at Windsor Castle got more than they bargained for today when a couple were caught having sex on the Queen's lawn.

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring signs asking visitors to Please Keep Off The Grass, the man and woman, said to be in their early 30, selected a spot near the castle's Garter Tower and stripped off in full view of hotels, pubs and shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An employee at the Harte and Garter Hotel, which overlooks the castle, said guests went out to observe the scene and could not believe their eyes. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: "People were shouting things like 'what are you doing?' but the couple didn't seem to care at all. It was going on for about 10 or 15 minutes, which is quite a long time, considering the location."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressive. Quite impressive. And, of course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Japanese tourists were comparing their videos."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, most important of all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not known whether the Queen was in residence at Windsor Castle at the time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have thought that Windsor Castle would be such an aphrodisiac that it completely overwhelmed this couple's self-control, but apparently I don't know much about aphrodisiacs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/sometimes_youve_just_gotta_do_it.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/LBRixXeHpRk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241324228519"><id gr:original-id="542 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c44db18f38094eb1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Feel Good Drinks" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/662"/><category term="health" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/193"/><category term="sugar" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/663"/><title type="html">The "Feel Good" Drinks Experience</title><published>2009-05-02T23:16:29Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T23:16:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/542" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I work in Maidenhead and live in Windsor, and that means either cycling to work, or getting the train. Since cycling the 16 mile round trip usually means spending at least the next two days with a bag of frozen peas down my trousers easing the angry swelling and coaxing everything back into life again, I'm most often on the train, cursing the scum that seem to inhabit our railways: commuters who stand in front of doorways at the platform preventing people from getting off; selfish morons who decide that maybe 6pm is a great time to go and spend half an hour haggling over a season ticket at the one ticket booth that's open; and announcers saying that they're really terribly sorry about the late arrival of the 17:48 to Paddington, only the wrong kind of pigeon shat on the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate commuting, and so when I saw a drink available from the kiosk at Maidenhead called "&lt;a href="http://www.feelgooddrinks.co.uk/"&gt;Feel Good&lt;/a&gt;", I willingly handed over £2 for it, on the basis that I couldn't really feel any worse, and if it turned out to be crap I could always smash the glass bottle and slit my wrists with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a testament to just how boring my journey home is that I spent much of it contemplating the drink, and writing this blog post. I did it because the &lt;a href="http://www.feelgooddrinks.co.uk/"&gt;Feel Good Drinks&lt;/a&gt; company really, really makes my toes curl, from their irritatingly cheery labels to their "Spread Feelgoodness!" slogan, that leaps out at you like some sort of demented hippie pest. Let's face it, if a non-alcoholic drink is enough to make you happy, then you've got some pretty low expectations of life. Fortunately everybody has some dirt in their laundry, and these annoying little drink-manufacturers-slash-lifestyle-gurus are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole company markets itself on goodness. It's a young, healthy, cheerful drink for young, healthy, cheerful people who go jogging and use lots of exclamation marks and call things gorgeous in the incessantly cheerful manner that suggests that actually the smiles and the exclamation marks are all just fake and that after a few too many vodkas they'd be turning up at their ex-partner's house with a dead rabbit and a kitchen knife. Or maybe I'm just projecting there a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;the advertising for their new kids' range&lt;/a&gt; they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But thats not all the good news for you feel good fans!! ...we are also really excited to announce the arrival of our new Feel Good Kids range. In handy, kid-friendly wedge cartons and made with 100% natural ingredients, these fruity beauties offer all the good stuff parents want and all the great taste and fun that make kids feel good!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel Good Kids are blended from 2/3 juice and 1/3 water to offer kids maximum refreshment and of course, there is absolutely no added sugar or nasties in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great effort I'll ignore the hideous use of grammar (where is the apostrophe on 'kids', why are there so many exclamation marks, and what the hell happened in the middle of the first sentence?!) and focus on the point here, which is that they're marketing this drink as a lovely, healthy drink for children full of goodness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And incidentally, if you think I'm being to harsh about their cheerfulness, let me direct you to this feel good quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And our brightly coloured cartons include a feel good doodle drawn especially for us by some feel good kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes you want to vomit in their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this family-friendly goodness doesn't quite tell the whole story, as I realised when I looked at the ingredients. They proudly boast "no added sugar", but this isn't surprising given that the gorgeous lovely natural feel-good sugar already in the product comes to a whopping 9g per 100g - in fact the drink has as much sugar as a can of &lt;a href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/us_nutrition.html"&gt;Coca Cola&lt;/a&gt;, and marginally &lt;i&gt;more calories&lt;/i&gt;. If it had any more sugar added, it would in fact become a damp solid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no doubt that the kids who drink this stuff will feel pretty damn good indeed, at least before they crash and lose their teeth, but parents may be less keen. True, it's not full of corn syrup and it won't turn your children yellow like &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/578945.stm"&gt;some brands have been prone to do&lt;/a&gt;, but it's certainly not a healthy alternative to anything, and the cheery, chirpy brand image just comes across to me as a bit cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got nothing against sugary drinks, and it's very tasty (if rather expensive), but I'm less than impressed by the marketing. Don't try and imply that a product with the calorific and sugar content of a can of regular Coke is a healthy alternative. And stop being so damned cheerful. If I want lifestyle advice from a drink I'll go find the nearest friendly barman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year this news story comes out, possibly just cut and pasted from the article from the year before. And every year they bury the lead. See if you can spot the most important part of this story about the “invisibility” cloak from the second paragragh:A team led by Xiang Zhang, a principal investigator with Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and director of UC Berkeley’s Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center, has created a “carpet cloak” from nanostructured silicon that conceals the presence of objects placed under it from optical detection. &lt;strong&gt;While the carpet itself can still be seen&lt;/strong&gt;, the bulge of the object underneath it disappears from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s right &lt;strong&gt;the invisibility cloak is visible&lt;/strong&gt;. Now don’t get me wrong. Certainly amazing advances are being made in this area but I wouldn’t count on a Harry Potter-level invisibility cloak for the next 200 years or so. I just wish the writers of these stories wouldn’t sensationalize them.  I mean &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/10/18/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-101708/"&gt;I reported the last one in this blog just 7 months ago&lt;/a&gt;. Well at least that’s another year before I have to read another stupid article about the damned invisibility cloak.&lt;/p&gt;

He is a key player in the climate change debate (see his self-description &lt;a href="http://asrc.albany.edu/people/faculty/wang/wang.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Wang has been accused of scientific fraud. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no inclination to "weigh in" on the topic of climate change. However the case involves issues of integrity that are at the very core of proper science. These issues are the same whether they are raised in a pharmaceutical clinical trial, in a basic science laboratory, by a climate change "denialist" or a "warmist". The case involves the hiding of data, access to data, and the proper description of "method" in science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case is also of interest because it provides yet another example of how *not* to create trust in a scientific misconduct investigation. It adds to the litany of cases suggesting that Universities cannot be allowed to investigate misconduct of their own star academics. The University response has so far been incoherent on its face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doug Keenan, the mathematician who &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620.htm"&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; the case of Wang is on the "sceptic" side of the climate change debate. He maintains that "almost by itself, the withholding of their raw data by [climate] scientists tells us that they are not scientists". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below is my own summary of the straightforward substance of this case. I wrote to Wei-Chyung Wang, to Lynn Videka (VP at Albany, responsible for the investigation), and to John H. Reilly (a lawyer at Albany) asking for any correction or comments on the details presented below. My request was acknowledged prior to publication, but no factual correction was suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Case Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The allegations concern two publications. These are:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jones P.D., Groisman P.Y., Coughlan M., Plummer N., Wang W.-C., Karl T.R. (1990), “Assessment of urbanization effects in time series of surface air temperature over land”, Nature, 347: 169–172. (&lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b90.pdf"&gt;PDF here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wang W.-C., Zeng Z., Karl T.R. (1990), “Urban heat islands in China”, Geophysical Research Letters, 17: 2377–2380. (&lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b23.pdf"&gt;PDF here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The publications concern temperature at a variety of measuring stations over three decades (1954-1983). Stations are denoted by name or number. A potential confounder in such research is that measuring stations may be moved to different locations at different points in time. It is clearly important that readers of publications understand the methodology, and important confounders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The publications make the following statements:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Statement A) "The stations were selected on the basis of station history: we chose those with few, if any, changes in instrumentation, location or observation times." [Jones et al.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Statement B) "They were chosen based on station histories: selected stations have relatively few, if any, changes in instrumentation, location, or observation times…." [Wang et al.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The publications refer to a report produced jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) which details station moves, and the publications further suggest that stations with few if any moves or changes were selected on the basis of that report. However: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of 84 stations that were selected, Keenan found that information about only 35 are available in the DOE/CAS report&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of those 35 stations at least half did have substantial moves (e.g 25 km). One station had five different locations during 1954–1983 as far as 41 km apart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If true, it appears that Statements A and B would be false, or at best grossly misleading. If false, readers would have been misled both in terms of the status of the stations and the manner in which they had been selected (or not selected).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keenan then communicated with the author of one of the publications (Jones) to ask about the source of location information pertaining to the other 49 stations that had not been selected using the described methodology. Jones informed Keenan that his co-author Wang had selected those stations in urban and rural China based on his "extensive knowledge of those networks".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On 11 April 2007 Keenan E-mailed Wang, asking "How did you ensure the quality of the data?”. Wang did not answer for several weeks, but on 30 April 2007 he replied as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The discussion with Ms. Zeng last week in Beijing have re-affirmed that she used the hard copies of station histories to make sure that the selected stations for the study of urban warming in China have relatively few, if any, changes in instrumentation, location, or observation times over the study period (1954-1983)"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keenan points out that the “hard copies” to which Wang refers were not found by the authors of the DOE/CAS report, who had endeavored to be "comprehensive" (and that the DOE/CAS report was authored in part by Zeng, one of the co-authors on Wang). Keenan further notes that any form of comprehensive data covering these stations during the Cultural Revolution would be implausible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In August 2007 Keenan submitted a report to the &lt;a href="http://www.albany.edu/"&gt;University at Albany&lt;/a&gt;, alleging fraud. Wang could at that stage have made the "hard copy" details of the stations selected available to the scientific community. However, he failed to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In May 2008, the University at Albany wrote to Keenan that they had conducted an investigation and asked him to comment on it (see the rather &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b523.pdf"&gt;odd letter&lt;/a&gt;). However they refused to show him the report of the investigation or any of the evidence to allow any comment (further &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b604.htm"&gt;odd letter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In August 2008 the University sent Keenan an astonishing letter of "&lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b811.htm"&gt;determination&lt;/a&gt;" stating that they did not find that Wang had fabricated data, but that they refused to provide any investigation report or any other information at all &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620/b811.htm"&gt;because&lt;/a&gt; "the Office of Research Integrity regulations preclude discussion of any information pertaining to this case with others who were not directly involved in the investigation".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wang has still not made the station records available to the scientific community. If he provided such records to the University as part of a misconduct investigation, then the University has apparently concealed them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the absence of any explanation to the contrary, it seems that the methodology for station selection as described in these two publications was false or at best grossly misleading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wang maintains that hard copy records do exist detailing the location of stations selected by himself outwith the published methodology. However the refusal to clarify "method" is inappropriate and a form of misconduct in and of itself. It does not lend credence to Wang's assertion that fraud did not take place. It would also be necessary to see records of stations that were not selected, in order to confirm that selection was indeed random, and only "on the basis of station history".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The University at Albany is in a difficult position. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the University received such records as part of the supposed misconduct investigation, then they could easily resolve the problem by making them available to the scientific community and to readers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the University does not have such records then they have been complicit in misconduct and in coverup of misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the University at Albany does have such records, but such records are not in accordance with the stated methodology of the publications, then the University has more serious difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Investigations" of scientific misconduct should themselves align with the usual principles of scientific discourse (open discussion, honesty, transparency of method, public disclosure of evidence, open public analysis and public discussion and reasoning underlying any conclusion). This was not the case at the University at Albany. When you see universities reluctant to investigate things properly, it provides reasonable evidence that they really don't want to investigate things properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thejabberwock.org/blogl/dilbert2006222.png" align="center" width="450" height="144" border="0" hspace="1" vspace="10"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For further information on this case see &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.informath.org/pubs/EnE07a.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/04/fake-editorial-board-of-mercks-fake.html"&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/05/calcium-and-weight-loss-barking-up.html"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/30682564-9209029718865305361?l=scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Aubrey Blumsohn)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog</id><title type="html">Scientific Misconduct Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241306400147"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/a_warning_for_the_herpeto-unct.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d4808bf2709673c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current events"/><title type="html">A warning for the herpeto-unctuous.</title><published>2009-05-02T23:03:50Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T23:03:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/ePFZS5R5Yrs/a_warning_for_the_herpeto-unct.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/a_warning_for_the_herpeto-unct.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems that some people respond to public concern about swine flu and its spread by trying to sell you stuff.

It has now been launched and you can &lt;a href="http://theclade.faultline.org/index.php/site/article/whats_the_clade/" title=""&gt;read all about it&lt;/a&gt; and see the first contributions (and perhaps decide to join in and contribute yourself):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Clade will bring together environmentally concerned writers, artists, photographers, videographers and podcasters who want to go beyond "environmentalism as usual." Environmentalism encompasses wilderness protection and human social justice, women's rights and artistic freedom, online organizing and solitary contemplation. We intend to reclaim environmental journalism from the Hearsts and Knight-Ridders of the world, to open-source the business of environmental reporting.

&lt;p&gt;Who contributes to The Clade? You do. Sign up as a contributor: when we launch, you can share your observations, reporting, links to valuable websites, crossposts of your enviro entries on your personal blog, or other environmental information. You need not be an expert journalist, essayist or biologist. All you need is passion for the planet, a bit of familiarity with HTML, and the ability to construct a grammatically correct sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clade is a group of individuals and their common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a useful concept in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is all about degrees of kinship, and describing which groups share which common ancestors is the same as determining their degrees of kinship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a family. All life on this planet, past and present, is related. Sharks, mosses, yeast, lobsters, sponges and you: kin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not one big happy family here on Earth, to be sure. One family member in particular has been getting out of line, claiming more and more of Earth's household for its own use. Even when we're confronted with the unsustainablity of our ways and decide to reform them, we ignore our other family members. We worry about fixing the climate because we want to stay comfortable, not because billions of our relatives will die, thousands of species going extinct. In terms of sheer numbers of threatened species, we have brought about what may be the worst extinction crisis the Earth has ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We humans like to think of ourselves as distinct from the rest of the living world, but we're all in this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, get in touch with us at The Clade. And please spread the word to anyone you think may be interested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this panel discussion, experts on copyright law and scholarly publishing discuss how scholars and researchers can take full advantage of opportunities afforded by digital technology in today's legal environment, and suggest ways to advocate for positive change. The panelists are Heather Joseph, who has been Executive Director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC); Michael Carroll, Visiting Professor of Law at American University's Washington College of Law and a founding member of the Board of Directors of Creative Commons; and Director of the Columbia University Copyright Advisory Office Kenneth Crews, whose research focuses on copyright issues, particularly as they relate to the needs of scholarship at the university.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/scholarship-digital-age-information-infrastructure-and-i" title=""&gt;Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's research and scholarship is data- and information-intensive, distributed, interdisciplinary, and collaborative. However, the scholarly practices, products, and sources of data vary widely between disciplines. Some fields are more advantaged than others by the array of content now online and by the tools and services available to make use of that content. UCLA Professor of Information Studies Christine Borgman provides an overview of new developments in scholarly information infrastructure, including policy issues such as open access and intellectual property, and addresses the implications of e-science for cyberlearning. Borgman is the author of more than 180 publications in the fields of information studies, computer science, and communication, including two widely praised books on digital technology and scholarship. She is a lead investigator for the Center for Embedded Networked Systems (CENS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and chaired the NSF's Task Force on Cyberlearning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/open-science-good-research-good-researchers" title=""&gt;Open Science: Good For Research, Good For Researchers?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Open science refers to information-sharing among researchers and encompasses a number of initiatives to remove access barriers to data and published papers, and to use digital technology to more efficiently disseminate research results. Advocates for this approach argue that openly sharing information among researchers is fundamental to good science, speeds the progress of research, and increases recognition of researchers. Panelists: Jean-Claude Bradley, Associate Professor of Chemistry and Coordinator of E-Learning for the School of Arts and Sciences at Drexel University; Barry Canton, founder of Gingko BioWorks and the OpenWetWare wiki, an online community of life science researchers committed to open science that has over 5,300 users; Bora Zivkovic, Online Discussion Expert for the Public Library of Science (PLoS) and author of "A Blog Around the Clock."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/future-book-can-endangered-monograph-survive" title=""&gt;Future of the Book: Can the Endangered Monograph Survive?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Panelists Helen Tartar, Editorial Director at Fordham University Press; Sanford Thatcher, Director of Penn State University Press and past President of the Association of American University Presses; and Ree DeDonato, Director of Humanities and History and Acting Director of Union Theological Seminary's Burke Library of Columbia University Libraries/Information Services discuss the economics and process of scholarly publishing and the future of the monograph. Columbia's Deputy University Librarian and Associate Vice President for Digital Programs and Technology Services Patricia Renfro introduces the panel, which is followed by a question-and-answer session.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/final-impact-what-factors-really-matter" title=""&gt;Final Impact: What Factors Really Matter?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A panel discussion on the debate about the best way to rank the importance and influence of scholarly publications. Panelists: Marian Hollingsworth, director of Publisher Relations at Thomson Reuters and former assistant director of the National Federation of Abstracting and Information Services; Jevin West, an Achievement Awards for College Scientists Fellow at the University of Washington's Biology Department and head developer for Eigenfactor.org; and Johan Bollen, a staff researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the principal investigator of the MESUR project. Columbia University Librarian Jim Neal introduces the talk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stuart Shieber, James O. Welch, Jr. and Virginia B. Welch Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Office for Scholarly Communication at Harvard University, discusses open access at Harvard.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BumfBox.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BumfBox.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken in a toilet at the Shin Kong Center in Beijing on December 15, 2007 by a friend of Ori Tavor, who sent it to me a couple of days ago.  Interestingly enough, it is not really a case of Chinglish since the translation is accurate, but it seems odd that the translator (or software) chose the word "bumf" for toilet paper.  To show that this usage of "bumf" is not just an isolated aberration in China, but is as widespread as "closestool" for "toilet," here is a &lt;a href="http://www.made-in-china.com/showroom/xinhua77/product-detailxeonbYNEsPcR/China-Bumf-Case-TE4002-.html"&gt;"bumf case"&lt;/a&gt; for tissue paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumf turns out to be British slang, dating back to the late 19th century — the OED glosses it as &amp;quot;Toilet-paper; hence, paper (esp. with contemptuous implication), documents collectively&amp;quot;.  It is short for &amp;quot;bum fodder,&amp;quot; a sort of primitive version of our toilet paper, but it can also refer to printed matter, such as pamphlets, forms, or memorandums, especially of an official nature and deemed of little interest or importance. Among the OED&amp;#39;s more striking citations are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1912&lt;/strong&gt; V. WOOLF&lt;em&gt; Let. &lt;/em&gt;16 Nov. in &lt;em&gt;Woolf &amp;amp; Strachey Lett.&lt;/em&gt; (1956) 46 Is this letter written upon Bumf? It looks like it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1930&lt;/strong&gt; WYNDHAM LEWIS &lt;em&gt;Apes of God&lt;/em&gt; (1932) v. 161 Low-lid fodder or high-brow bumph!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1938 &lt;/strong&gt;E. WAUGH &lt;em&gt;Scoop&lt;/em&gt; II. iv. 211, I shall get a daily pile of bumf from the Ministry of Mines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sometimes also spelled "bumph", as in this note from the Vancouver Courier ("&lt;a href="http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/artsandentertainment/story.html?id=f1419886-5087-4b8e-b286-98e6fb4851e4"&gt;Ukraine in the membrane, yo&lt;/a&gt;", 4/29/2009): "According to the press bumph, Spin and Pitchfork named the group's video for 'Jerk It' one of the year's best".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders where and how the Chinese translators dig up these obsolete terms.  And could their predilection for them stem from squeamishness in using current English terms relating to bodily functions?  I doubt that this could be so in every case, since there are countless examples of gross scatalogical language in public places (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.engrishdaily.com/2008/12/mang-out/"&gt;"MANG OUT AFTER SHIT"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.beijing-visitor.com/index.php?cID=412&amp;amp;pID=1207"&gt;Genitl Emen, Pubic Toilet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jobsinchina.com/blog/flickr-picks-no-pissing-on-the-guangzhou-metro/"&gt;no pissing on the Guangzhou Metro&lt;/a&gt;, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241291475554"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/05/moncktons-deliberate-manipulation/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c6cf4c261ac37c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><category term="IPCC"/><category term="Instrumental  Record"/><title type="html">Monckton’s deliberate manipulation</title><published>2009-05-02T18:59:49Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T18:59:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/05/moncktons-deliberate-manipulation/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our favorite contrarian, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/09/monckton_as_if_i_was_some_pott.php"&gt;potty peer&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Monckton has been indulging in a little &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Hm2HOZUNU"&gt;aristocratic artifice&lt;/a&gt; again. Not one to be constrained by mere facts or observable reality, he has &lt;a href="http://climaterealists.com/index.php?id=3329&amp;amp;linkbox=true"&gt;launched a sally&lt;/a&gt; against Andy Revkin for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html?_r=2"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gf8NK1WAOc"&gt;shocking&lt;/a&gt; news that past industry disinformation campaigns were not sincere explorations of the true uncertainties in climate science.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://climaterealists.com/attachments/database/Letter%20of%20formal%20complaint%20to%20Clark%20Hoyt%20Esq.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; he has written to the NY Times public editor, with its liberal sprinkling of his usual pomposity, has at its heart the following graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/monckton_temp.jpg" width="70%/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other issues, it is quite amusing that Monckton apparently thinks that; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; trends from January 2002 are relevant to a complaint about a story discussing a 1995 report, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; someone might be fooled by the cherry-picked January 2002 start date,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; no-one would notice that he has just made up the IPCC projection curves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last is even more amusing because he was &lt;a href="http://rankexploits.com/musings/2009/moncktons-artful-graph/"&gt;caught out&lt;/a&gt; making stuff up on a slightly different figure just a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the extent of this chicanery, one needs only plot the actual IPCC projections against the observations. This can be done a number of ways, firstly, plotting the observational data and the models used by IPCC with a common baseline of 1980-1999 temperatures (as done in the 2007 report) (Note that the model output is for the annual mean, monthly variance would be larger):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck1.jpg" width="45%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck3.jpg" width="45%/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These show clearly that 2002-2009 is way too short a period for the trends to be meaningful and that Monckton’s estimate of what the IPCC projects for the current period is woefully wrong. Not just wrong, fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if one assumes that the baseline should be the year 2002 making no allowance for internal variability (which makes no sense whatsoever), you would get the following graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/comp_monck2.jpg" width="60%/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- still nothing like Monckton showed. Instead, he appears to have derived his ‘projections’ by drawing a line from 2002 to a selection of real projections in 2100 and ignoring the fact that the actual projections accelerate as time goes on, and thus strongly over-estimating the projected changes that are expected now (see &lt;a href="http://rankexploits.com/musings/2009/moncktons-artful-graph/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest this be thought a mere aberration or a slip of his quill, it turns out he has previously faked the data on projections of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well. This graph is from a recent presentation of his, compared to the &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelforce/ghgases/GCM_2004.html"&gt;actual projections&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/monckton_co2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/monckton_co2.jpg" width="50%/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_co2_2010.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_co2_2010.jpg" width="45%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this be described except as fake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this nonsense, is there anything to Monckton’s complaint about Revkin’s story? Sadly no. Once one cuts out the paranoid hints about dark conspiracies between “prejudiced campaigners”, Al Gore and the New York Times editors, the only point he appear to make is that this passage from the scientific advice somehow redeems the industry lobbyists who ignored it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential for a human impact on climate is based on well-established scientific fact, and should not be denied. While, in theory, human activities have the potential to result in net cooling, a concern about 25 years ago, the current balance between greenhouse gas emissions and the emissions of particulates and particulate-formers is such that essentially all of today’s concern is about net warming. However, as will be discussed below, it is still not possible to accurately predict the magnitude (if any), timing or impact of climate change as a result of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Also, because of the complex, possibly chaotic, nature of the climate system, it may never be possible to accurately predict future climate or to estimate the impact of increased greenhouse gas concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a curious claim, since the passage is pretty much mainstream. For instance, in the IPCC Second Assessment Report (1995) (p528): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Complex systems often allow deterministic predictability of some characteristics … yet do not permit skilful forecasts of other phenomena …
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or even more clearly in IPCC TAR (2001):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability distribution of the system’s future possible states….
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more central to the point Revkin was making was the deletion of the sections dealing with how weak the standard contrarian arguments were – arguments that GCC publications continued to use for years afterward (and indeed arguments that Monckton is still using) (see this &lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/a-climate-correction/"&gt;amendment&lt;/a&gt; to the original story). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monckton’s ironic &lt;em&gt;piece de resistance&lt;/em&gt; though is the fact that he entitled his letter “Deliberate Misrepresentation” – and this is possibly the only true statement in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241290998267"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/communication_is_not_speech_is_a_civil_right">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb010f0281e383d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Communication (Is Not Speech) Is a Civil Right</title><published>2009-05-02T19:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T19:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/communication_is_not_speech_is_a_civil_right" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/declanjewell/517966692/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/197/517966692_d5e100b039_m.jpg" alt="a computer keyboard shown in extreme perspective" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PS2005-00113.html"&gt;American Speech-Language-Hearing Association&lt;/a&gt; (ASHA) states,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the position of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) that communication is the essence of human life and that all people have the right to communicate to the fullest extent possible. No individuals should be denied this right, irrespective of the type and/or severity of communication, linguistic, social, cognitive, motor, sensory, perceptual, and/or other disability(ies) they may present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of an autistic boy who uses American Sign Language as his primary means of communication.  The public school refused to provide him an interpreter on grounds that he is not deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of a school system that only allowed its students to use their communication devices at school, but not at home.  Imagine being allowed to speak for 5 hours each day and then having that ability taken away from you for the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a story about the misconception that AAC is undesirable, when for many of us it is truly &lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/spchasst.html"&gt;our greatest freedom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My head is mostly tracked into this topic right now between my first intensive (and highly successful) use of &lt;a href="http://proloquo2go.com"&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/a&gt; last week, and preparing a presentation on AAC for the &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;IACC&lt;/a&gt; for Monday, so that's about the only topic I can manage a post on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an important topic though.&lt;/p&gt;

Genesis 5:24), Elijah (As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven. 2 Kings 2:11), Jesus and maybe even Moses {(Transfiguration (Matt 17:3 and parallels), in the Jewish work, &lt;em&gt;The Assumption of Moses&lt;/em&gt; and its likely New Testament preservations in Acts 7:36 and Jude 8 - 9)} died, but were taken up into Heaven clothes, parasites and all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the parasites in the guts of Enoch and Elijah never died, but were translated to Heaven with them, the E. coli parasitic bacterium in the gut of Jesus died and were resurrected back to life by God along with the body of Jesus. Theologically not only are we talking about a single bodily resurrection, but millions of parasitic bacterium E. coli who were also bodily resurrected too…Glory! Praise God!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Since some the resurrection narratives of Jesus are not coherent or expressed whether Jesus arose bodily or in spirit form only, some Gospels (such as Luke 24 below) went out of their way to prove a physical resurrection (To also counter the spiritual only view which later would be considered heretical), Jesus is not only handled by the apostles, but even eats food:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;36 While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace be to you.” 37 But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit. (Codex Bezae reads: “they thought they saw a ghost”). 38 And He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 39 “See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” 40 And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 41 While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 42 They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish; (the Textus Receptus better know as the King James adds: and of an honeycomb.) 43 and He took it and ate it before them.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, according to Luke 24, Jesus’ E. coli parasites were also alive and still active in Jesus’ holy gut to help break down the fish (and, maybe even the honeycomb) Jesus ate telling us not only did God resurrect Jesus, but God resurrected the holy parasites that dwelled in the promised land of Jesus’ holy gut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, like the E. coli in the guts of the living Enoch, Elijah; Jesus’ resurrected E. coli were taken up to Heaven with Jesus too and now dwell up yonder only to return again to earth along with Jesus in the Second Coming!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4285269311575286173?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, today is my mom’s 80&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s been a huge influence on me. Of course, your parents are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be, for better or worse, but in this case I’m going with better. My parents were really great about encouraging my siblings and me to pursue the lives we wanted (including letting me keep my giant 10″ Newtonian telescope in the corner of the living room for years — visitors thought it was a water heater), and that resulted in all of us going after unusual or non-standard careers. And, come to think of it, all of us have made major career changes at some point in our lives; I consider that to be a positive aspect since it meant we were unsatisfied with the way things were going and, rather than settle, we went off in new directions to find what it was we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My oldest brother &lt;del&gt;is an electrical engineer&lt;/del&gt; has a degree in computer science and now runs a computer and networking consultant business in Atlanta. My other brother’s the chief engineer for construction in a Maryland county public school system. My sister has a Masters degree in music and sang opera, for criminy’s sake! And me, I’ve had a handful of weird careers myself. Writing stuff while wearing pajamas may be the most mainstream of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my brothers and sister owe a lot to my mom. I know she reads this blog (though the fire-eating and tattooing and gun-shooting stuff may have her reading this from behind the couch), and I also know she would love it if everyone here sent their best wishes to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday, Mom.&lt;/p&gt;

Look what can get you &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/corbett-religion-court-2387684-farnan-selna"&gt;in trouble with the law now&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mission Viejo high school history teacher violated the First Amendment by disparaging Christians during a classroom lecture, a federal judge ruled today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Corbett, a 20-year teacher at Capistrano Valley High School, was found guilty of referring to Creationism as "religious, superstitious nonsense" during a 2007 classroom lecture, denigrating his former Advanced Placement European history student, Chad Farnan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am astounded that Corbett was found guilty of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, he told the truth: creationism &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; religious, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a product of superstition, and it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; nonsense — it doesn&amp;#39;t fit any of the evidence we have about the history fo the world or life on it. We have to have the right to tell students not only that something is wrong, but that it is stupidly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we are being told over and over again that Christianity is not equivalent to creationism. This teacher has specifically said that creationism is nonsense, and this judge has equated a dismissal of a weird anti-scientific belief with making a rude remark about Christianity. So…where are all the Christians rising in outrage at the slander of their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and this must be said, Chad Farnan is a self-righteously moronic creationist wanker who deserves to have his stupidity pointed out publicly, in the classroom and out of it, far and wide. Spread the word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/high_school_teacher_guilty_of.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0_B8ZoRAvi8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241278162173"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8578638869321051584">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c5842193eff8000</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">What American Science Teachers Can't Say</title><published>2009-05-02T15:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T15:29:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-american-science-teachers-cant-say.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8578638869321051584/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8578638869321051584" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> John Pieret is a pain in the lawyer.

About the time I teach them about analyzing pedigrees and about sex linkage, I show them this pedigree and ask them to figure out what kind of trait it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/05/weird_ped.jpeg" width="400" height="205" alt="weird_ped.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit of a stumper. There&amp;#39;s the problem of variability in its expression, whatever it is, which makes interpretation a little fuzzy — that&amp;#39;s a good lesson in itself, that genetics isn&amp;#39;t always a matter of rigid absolutes. They usually think, though, that it must be some Y-linked trait, since only males (the squares in the diagram) have it at all, and no females (the circles) are ever affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I show them the labeled version, and there&amp;#39;s a moment of &amp;quot;Hey, wait a  minute…&amp;quot; that ripples through the class. Keep in mind that even the science classes at my university contain typically 60% or more women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/05/weird_ped_labeled.jpeg" width="400" height="205" alt="weird_ped_labeled.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a truly horrible pedigree. Not only is it trying to reduce a very complex trait like &amp;quot;scientific ability&amp;quot; to a discrete character, but its assessment is entirely subjective — a point that is really brought home by pointing out that the pedigree was drawn by Francis Galton, who judged himself brilliant, and that he was evaluating his own family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silent tragedy here, though, is all those women judged as lacking in the characters of brilliance and scientific ability. They are rendered as nullities by the prejudices of the time — even if they had shown the spark of genius, they probably would not have been recognized by Galton — and by a culture that wouldn&amp;#39;t have trained or encouraged girls to do more than master needlework and laundry and household management, and would have brought them up to value the fruitfulness of their ovaries over the product of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at all those empty circles. I'm sure some of them had the capacity to be an entrepreneur like Josiah Wedgwood, or an eclectic philosopher like Erasmus Darwin, or a deep and meticulous scientist like Charles Darwin, or even just a successful doctor like Robert Darwin (II-4; not someone I would have characterized as brilliant, and also an indicator of the variety of abilities Galton was lumping together in his arbitrary judgments). Half the scientific potential in that pedigree was thrown away by restrictive social conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of blind bias we have to end, and I think this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/04/the_letters_to_our_daughters_p.php"&gt;Letters to our Daughters project&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful idea. Stop pretending the circles are empty, and ask them to speak; color in those circles with talent. If you are a female scientist, or you know a female scientist, write in and set an example, and show the next generation of our daughters that they have a history, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/05/the_letters_to_our_daughters_p_1.php"&gt;first letter in the project now&lt;/a&gt;. I think it needs a few thousand more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blogger, Lisa Sharkey, opines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What can I do to keep my family safe? How can I boost our immune systems now and what complementary medicines can I begin taking immediately, regardless if I ever come in contact with the dreaded Swine Flu? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what sort of answers are coming, I bet.

But Who's Counting?&lt;/a&gt;", Washington Post, 4/29/2009, someone identifying himself as andrewsalomon added judicially-sanctioned electrocution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I don't know anything about the million-word business, but is there any chance of getting Benjamin Zimmer or, I don't know, Congress, to enact  a statute that would allow for the zapping of 1,000 volts of  electricity through anyone who uses "impact" as a verb?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The commenters on Caroline Gail's "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8013859.stm"&gt;The words in the mental cupboard&lt;/a&gt;", BBC News, 4/28/2009, were mostly pretentious rather than aggressive. Thus Berenice Mortimer, from Westlock, Canada, wrote that "Unfortunately, one is considered elitist if one uses words which other people cannot understand. So, in a sense, one keeps one's knowledge well under wraps,"  and Kate Jones, from Lancaster UK, wrote "I remember my horror as a trainee teacher covering the legend of Beowulf with a year 7 class, at being told by one little boy that Beowulf ‘had a bling-bling shield’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the commenters at spEak You're bRanes  ("&lt;a href="http://ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com/2009/05/01/very-clever-people/"&gt;Very Clever People&lt;/a&gt;",  5/1/2009), using the pseudonym Head of English, cleverly mocked the rage beneath the surface, while adding premeditated vehicular assault to our growing list of retributional modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;No! The awful little fucker, how dare an 11 year old not appreciate  that they didn’t say ‘bling bling’ in the Middle Ages. Or in your  parent’s house.  God the kids today!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In my GCSE class, one smelly urban toe-rag said Juliet was “pro’bly  well fit, an’ that”. I was simply appalled. I waited for him after  school and ran him over. And I reversed over him a couple of times too,  to make sure that everyone clearly understood the guardianship of the  English language is the exclusive preserve of the middle class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain puzzled about why this camped-up rage over lexical and orthographic deficiencies seems to be a purely anglophone thing.  It's easy to find concerns over the vocabulary and literacy of Kids Today among (say) the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003952.html"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;,  and these concerns may be &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003971.html"&gt;linguistically ill-informed&lt;/a&gt; and full of class  prejudice. But I have yet to find a forum where people propose to defend la langue française with threats of assault, even in jest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241270949206"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6142815010238896974">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a72f5127ad136152</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Policy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Gary Goodyear Explains Canada's Science Policy</title><published>2009-05-02T13:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T13:28:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/gary-goodyear-explains-canadas-science.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6142815010238896974/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6142815010238896974" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Gary Goodyear, you might recall, is Canada&amp;#39;s Minster of State (Science and Technology).

Moderated by Mike Munro.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a good start for the anti-vaxers whose representative, Dr Giselle Cook, spent her introduction explaining to Mike Munro why he should refer to her as “pro-choice” not “anti-vaccine”. Her time would have been better spent establishing her point of view; instead she came across as flustered. For the pro, was Professor Peter McIntyre, who by contrast, was informed, concise and clearly stated that the small&lt;br&gt;
risks associated with vaccinating far outweigh the consequences of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told to interject anytime we liked, and of course it didn’t take long for Meryl Dorey to voice her opinion. But I’m pleased to report, she was smacked down several times by host Mike Munro and even by other mothers in the audience. But when she mispronounced Dana’s name and mumbled, “oh I’m sorry, I don’t really know how to pronounce it. I hope that’s right”, that was when I really began to question her sincerity for the parents of Dana McCaffery who sat only a few chairs away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will include a few tid-bits from proceedings today. There is too much to put in one post. However, much of it you will see on tomorrow night’s show and I don’t want to steal their thunder. Nevertheless, this gives you a taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion is the anti-vaxers did not come across very well. Particularly when Mike Munro asked the McCafferys about the hate mail they had received since appearing on the show last week.  There was a clearly audible gasp from the anti-vaxer side of the room and mumblings of that’s terrible etc, until Mike Munro looked straight at Meryl Dorey and said, “Didn’t many of those emails come from your organisation Meryl?”. Many of the anti-vaxers were heard to exclaim, we wouldn’t do that etc, but the damage was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meryl was unable to contain herself from accusing &lt;a href="http://www.ncirs.usyd.edu.au/staff/profiles.html"&gt;Prof. Peter McIntyre&lt;/a&gt; of being on the take from the government. She asked him how much money he received from the government for vaccinating kids. (Of course she was referring to the Maternity Immunisation Allowance scheme introduced in 1997, which &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/03/01/how-to-get-the-maternity-immunisation-allowance-without-getting-your-kids-vaccinated/"&gt;they also get access to&lt;/a&gt; by the way). Professor McIntyre looked at her blankly and replied - none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Munro inquired of Meryl Dorey’s medical qualifications, to which she replied;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; only that I have been researching this for 20 years&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Munro interjected - so you don’t have any formal medical qualifications? Well then perhaps we should let the doctors answer the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toni McCaffery asked Meryl Dorey if she had ever been in a neo-natal unit with kids experiencing whooping cough or measles, or seen a child go into cardiac arrest like she had Dana. Meryl, in a defying act of insensitivity said; “of course it is awful to see a child die, any child, but Dana?, Daanna?, I’m sorry, I don’t really know how to pronounce it…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hardly believe my ears when Meryl Dorey dragged out the Wakefield case as evidence that vaccines cause autism. Prof McIntyre commented that this had been repeatedly debunked to which she responded that there had since been seven publications “from reputable scientific journals” showing Wakefield’s data to be correct. Prof McIntyre looked quite bemused at this comment and calmly stated that not only had some of the data been faked but amongst other flaws, the study only involved 12 children and had &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/02/09/what-more-do-the-mmranti-vaccers-want/"&gt;since been retracted&lt;/a&gt; by the the Lancet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Munro asked her to produce said papers, Dorey claimed she had sent them to one of the researchers for the show. She claimed she had sent over 30 studies to the studio in support of her arguments including evidence of vaccine damage. Munro looked decidedly unimpressed and asked her to provide evidence instead of just making all these claims. For this, she cited a child in NSW and QLD (from memory) to which Munro responded, your evidence is one or two kids? You keep saying you have evidence for these things but you are unable to produce it in the studio today? Meryl replied, ”I gave you the details of the 2 kids I just mentioned, you didn’t contact them!!??” To which Munro replied, yes we did Ms Dorey and they did not want to talk to the programme. End of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munro inquired of a young mother with 5 month old twins about her sons’ vaccination status. The mother stated that she didn’t really know very much, so was unable to really comment, but she had chosen not to have her kids vaccinated. Munro repeated, “So you don’t really have all the information, you haven’t done the research, but you decided to not have your kids vaccinated anyway”; to which she replied yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sparked the ire of a mother with child a few seats behind, who’s child was recovering from whooping cough after contracting it before he was eligible for vaccination. This mother stated that she was not entirely happy sitting in a room with 2 babies in such close proximity to her son since he had not yet completed his full schedule of immunisations and further, her son could also infect the twins, since he was still recovering. But it also made the first mother look pretty naive and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about the anti-vax lobby is that they are always screeching that parents need more information, but when you offer them scientific data they always have a reason why it is wrong or not acceptable. Often it’s the Big Pharma conspiracy (pharmaceutical companies sponsored that study therefore it’s biased), or they counter offer you something written in a book that they once read. I presented the recent Nature research which links ~15% of autism cases to genes and it was dismissed it out of hand precisely because it only accounts for ~15%, therefore, what about the other ~85%? It must be the mercury and heavy metals in vaccines. It is very difficult to argue with people when their counter arguments have no basis in science and all science you do show them is wrong. Just like the creationists, they continually move the goal posts. And whilst they say they want more information, only as long as that information aligns with their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toni and David McCaffery were in the audience today. I sat next to David and we chatted throughout. They both thanked myself and Richard for our support. What they did today was unimaginably tough and brave. Dana only passed away 6 weeks ago. Yet the anti-vaxers bumble along seemingly oblivious. At one stage when discussion got around to Dana’s death I heard from behind me, someone say it was only one baby. David McCaffery leaned over to me and said, “It was my baby”.&lt;/p&gt;

Well I guess it has been a long and hard road for Charlie and for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's IEP meeting was yesterday afternoon. I'd asked for a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/setting_goals_for_the_iep"&gt;draft of his IEP&lt;/a&gt; and while reviewing it the night before and writing our Parental Statement, I paused several times to reread these sentences written by Charlie's teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted, Charlie's progress reports are generally full of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/because_iep_season_is_upon_us"&gt;SPs and NPs&lt;/a&gt;, as in "some progress" and "no progress." For years, he's been hampered by behavior problems that, due to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/growing_up_bigger_but_violent"&gt;growing taller&lt;/a&gt; and being quite athletic, have been much more difficult to address. It's taken several months for his teacher to get to know Charlie and to understand how to best teach him; to figure out why strategies that had sort of worked in the past, had long since ceased to. In the draft IEP she had written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Charlie has made significant progress on his academic programs.........His social skills are an area of strength. Charlie is friendly and enjoys interacting with others, teachers and peers alike."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He shows great interest and dexterity in pattern following and his fine motor skills are exceptional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been quite a while since I've read such affirmative statements about Charlie and his learning, and his abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true, Charlie's learning has been very much in the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;slow lane&lt;/a&gt;. And each at their own pace, so long as the rest of us understand that we need to adapt our pace to those for whom the road is longer, rockier, and uphill for most of the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what a view when you slow your step and stop to look around, and see what others before had missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year's IEP meeting was concise and well-orchestrated. Charlie will have the same classroom next year with speech, OT, and A.P.E., and will also continue to receive home programming/parent training throughout the summer and all throughout next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241247304799"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/global-protest-of-scientology-today/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5eec69690393da13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cults"/><category term="Anonymous"/><category term="protest"/><category term="Scientology"/><title type="html">Global protest of Scientology today</title><published>2009-05-02T06:54:27Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T06:54:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/global-protest-of-scientology-today/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG/800px-Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG/800px-Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG" alt="" width="257" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Thanks to the advent of the Internet, it’s become fairly well known that Scientology is a cult in the strictest sense of the world. It seems that the more official “church” documents get leaked and the more information gets out about the late L. Ron Hubbard’s little religion, the less tempting those “Free Stress Test” stands on the street and in subway stations become. For instance, when the animated television series &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; brought the truth behind Scientology’s secret foundation myth into America’s living rooms, Scientology officials felt so threatened they actually tried to stop the episode from ever rerunning it on Comedy Central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not the beliefs of Scientologists that critics attack. After all, the story of Xenu, the evil galactic overlord is arguably more plausible and less bizarre than the foundational myths of all 3 Abrahamic faiths. As silly as the image of ancient 747’s zipping across the universe and dropping nuclear bombs on seemingly unkillable Thetans who were already tossed into volcanoes is, it doesn’t hold a candle to The Holy Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, what most concerns Scientology’s critics are the well documented corroborating testimonies of hundreds–if not thousands at this point–of former members who have, despite intimidation, spoken out against the practices of the cult. Testimonies from the likes of individuals like Tory Christman, a former member of 30 years who actually worked in Scientology’s “Office of Special Affairs,” the cult’s propaganda department and who now tells all on her YouTube account under the user name ToryMagoo44. Critics like Christman make serious accusations against Scientology, claiming the church practices known brainwashing techniques, employs child labor, promotes disconnection policies between members and their non-Scientology loved ones, engages in blackmail and extortion, among a host of other serious accusations. Now I’m the first to admit that anecdotal evidence alone does not amount to anything, no matter how much of it you have. But there is strong evidence as well to support many of the claims. And the internet has only made this evidence more available to the public, especially after the group of young internet hackers calling themselves Anonymous chose to declare war on Scientology just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous mobilized a small army of motivated and mostly young activists and invited anyone to join them in their fight for social justice, which involved a systematic campaign of leaking Scientology secrets across the internet and mobilizing well-organized global protests outside Scientology centers in every major city in the world once a month. And about 15 months later, the monthly protests continue. Anonymous has planned their May protest for today, May 2. In New York City, the protest will begin in front of the Scientology Center on 46th St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are these men and women donning Guy Fawkes masks from the recent film &lt;em&gt;V For Vendetta&lt;/em&gt;? Scientology is notoriously harsh to their critics, often bullying them with expensive lawsuits and spreading libelous accusations. Those who thought up Anonymous realized that perhaps the best weapon in a guerrilla war against such a formidable opponent was a de-centralized group of faceless, anonymous protesters. Anonymous has no leader and anyone is welcome to participate in their protests. And on the off chance someone gets out of line, the group can easily dissociate from them without losing its reputation. Now in New York City, protesters are not allowed to wear masks covering their faces so local Anonymous members have taken to finding alternative ways to still incorporate the Guy Fawkes mask that has become the face of Anonymous such as wearing it on the back of their head while wearing dark sunglasses or other objects to keep their identities more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since Anonymous launched its campaign last year it seems like they’ve been nothing but bad news for Scientology. After the leaking of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;the now infamous and much ridiculed propaganda video of Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; explaining how Scientology is saving the world that strategically corresponded with the release of Andrew Morton’s unofficial biography of Tom Cruise, Anonymous officially first declared war on Scientology via YouTube video back in February of 2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/global-protest-of-scientology-today/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/JCbKv9yiLiQ/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous later leaked the complete footage of the silly private awards ceremony Scientology held to honor Cruise, where the aforementioned propaganda film was broadcast. Anonymous continued to get their hands on and leak more and more secret material never intended to reach the outside world while the army against the cult rapidly grew and grew with each new month. And soon Anonymous took to promoting &lt;a href="http://www.xenu.net/"&gt;Xenu.net&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running website that now serves as one-stop shopping that houses possibly the largest library of material about the cult outside of Scientology itself. I’ve also compiled a fairly large collection of resources about Scientology &lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Scientology"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, the epic war between Anonymous and Scientology continues right outside the doors to Scientology Centers in every major city. Pamphlets and fliers will be handed out. Chants will be sang. And a good time will be had by all who don’t happen to members of a cult called Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;

A big congratulations to this year's 166 recipients, who represent promising new researchers.  However, it cannot be pointed out enough how poorly this program meshes with funding for other Canadian students and scientists.  $50,000 for 3 years is what they get, which is 2.5x more than regular NSERC scholarship winners, $10,000 more than postdocs get, and nearly twice the average grant for people actually starting a lab.  Remember, too, that this is twice what they gave &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/casualties-of-nserc-peer-review.html"&gt;one of our leading statisticians&lt;/a&gt; this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What could have been funded with the $25 million instead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular MSc scholarships &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/bad-decisions-about-scholarships.html"&gt;for 2 years&lt;/a&gt;: 711, or&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular PhD scholarships for 3 years: 395, or&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discovery Grants at the average of $34K for 5 years: 146&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Update]&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, note the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The scholarships can be awarded to non-Canadians.  The plan, I presume, is to draw top students to Canada.  How likely is it that they'll stay when the find out that there is now a 65% chance that they will get an NSERC grant, and that it will average about $34,000 to run an entire lab?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intent is to award 500 of these per year.  That's $25 million per year on scholarship students, folks.  Meanwhile, 35% of existing researchers -- who already have PhDs, completed postdoctoral research, landed a job at a Canadian university, and have built a lab whose primary functions include training students -- get nothing, while the rest receive $15,000 less on average than single scholarship students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These scholarships represent a direct trade-off between funding the MSc program for 2 years instead of 1 year.  In other words, an already very competitive scholarship program just became decidedly elitist -- better to give a few people an outrageous sum than to fund more of our other top students in the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These scholarships further exacerbate the inequalities in research support among universities in Canada.  Not surprisingly, the largest schools got lots, mid-sized schools got some, and most of the smaller schools got none.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I have yet to meet a colleague who thinks this is a good idea.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8704558945742669077?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/9wqGyStudG8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241244127980"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38103705042d2222</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Zombie Outbreak</title><published>2009-05-02T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/zombies.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Spoof articles report that an epidemic has resulted in an outbreak of 'zombism.'</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241244127980"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/250f7ad10f03aab8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">GIVE and Take</title><published>2009-05-02T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/give.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Message details requirements of the GIVE (Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education) Act.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241243688284"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a3edd40d4e448ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">There's a Difference</title><published>2009-05-02T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/539-theres-a-difference.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reader "Roger" sent us this note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an education this last weekend.  I did not realize there was a difference between a "health" expo and a "wellness" expo.  My buddy got us a booth to display our line of supplements and power nutrition.  As I walked into the event center, I saw a couple of chiropractors.  I don't know what you think about them, but they were there teaching people about good posture....okay, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I walked in the door to the main exhibit room, I was floored.  First thing I saw was "aroma therapy"...doh!!  Then there was a guy sitting between two pillars with a crystal dangling between them.  He "channels" energy to the crystal because the nearest vortex is about 1000 miles away....double doh!!  Of course, the psychics, clairvoyants, and mediums all had booths and were offering readings.... "Doh" doesn't cover it here.  The event started at 11.  About 10:45, about ¾ of the people in there started to meditate with an eerie chant.  There was reiki, feng shui, an oxygen bar, light therapy, angel readings, crystal therapy - with crystals from the Himalayas...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241238717771"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3145">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5931be04c17b9512</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="East Africa"/><category term="Kenya"/><category term="Lysistrata"/><title type="html">Lysistrata Kenyan style</title><published>2009-05-02T04:31:21Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T04:31:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/lysistrata-kenyan-style/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:D7hlQNnhKeib8M:http://files.myopera.com/daxonmacs/blog/no-sex-480.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:D7hlQNnhKeib8M:http://files.myopera.com/daxonmacs/blog/no-sex-480.gif" alt="" width="129" height="129"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The women of Kenya have looked to the Ancient Greek comedy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata"&gt;Lysistrata&lt;/a&gt; to guide their fight for reform. Like the women of&lt;a title="Aristophanes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes"&gt;Aristophanes&lt;/a&gt;‘ play, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/04/30/kenya.sex.ban/index.html"&gt;they’ve decided to withhold sex until change is made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists in the East African nation are urging women to withhold sex for a week to protest the growing divide in Kenya’s coalition government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are asking even sex workers to join the cause, even if we have to pay them ourselves,” said Patricia Nyaundi, executive director of the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they know how to play hardball. They’ve even gotten the support of the wives of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. They’ve definitely gotten the attention of one resident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamau plans to plead his case with his wife. “Seven days is just too much,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue that seems they seem to want addressed is the post-election violence that killed more than 1,000 people last year.&lt;/p&gt;

One such person is Joel W. Walker, a candidate for the College Station, Texas, Schools Board of Trustees, the local school board.  Walker is a theoretical physicist, a Republican self-described as being “both fiscally and socially conservative,” and a supporter of honest science education.  On his campaign site Walker has posted &lt;a href="http://www.joelwalker.net/science/statesman.html" rel="external "&gt;a strong and informed essay&lt;/a&gt; as an open response to Texas State BOE chairman and creationist dentist Don McLeroy.  I’ll quote just some bits of it – go read the whole thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the role of skepticism in science, Walker wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly science embraces skepticism, but there is a deep flaw in the vision of science which is being advocated. Skepticism in the face of a preponderance of evidence is only unreasonable doubt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a later paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stars (by the great expanses across which their shining light has patiently traveled and also by the measurable rate of their recession) and the Earth itself (within its tediously accumulated strata and by residual proportion of radio emitting isotopes) testify in unison to the great age of our planet and universe. The older and deeper places of the Earth hold the remains of primitive creatures which increase in variety and complexity as the hand of geological time winds forward. The DNA of our very bodies tells the history (within mutations of long silenced genes and the remnants of ancient viral intrusions) of our separation by degrees from other creatures of the Earth in a common descent. Imposing a false ambiguity on these facts makes mockery of the precious drops of knowledge which mankind has slowly wrung out of the natural world. It is pure scientific retreat, not progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many other local school board candidates would refer to the pseudogene and endogenous retroviral evidence for evolution?  Hey, Abbie!  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this sentence is right on target:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An entrenched mindset bordering on reflexive antipathy to the opinions of our most distinguished scholars has no place on our State Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s of some interest that Walker links to Jeremy Mohn’s &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/introhome.htm" rel="external "&gt;An Evolving Creation&lt;/a&gt; site for an analysis of McLeroy’s quotemining.  Jeremy is a Christian, a public school biology teacher in Kansas, and a strong defender of honest science education.  He has an exhaustive analysis of McLeroy’s quote mining on his site.  With Cheryl Shepherd-Adams. Jeremy also has &lt;a href="http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/standup/aboutme.htm" rel="external "&gt;Stand up for REAL science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are rays of hope, exemplified by Joel Walker, but only rays.  One more time: those who support honest science education have got to get out there in the world and make your presence and position known, and participate in the political processes and educational institutions that determine of what children are taught in science classes.  In a &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/sadly-another-h.html#comment-185270" rel=""&gt;comment on an earlier post&lt;/a&gt; Flint likened the effects of creationist child rearing to the ancient custom of foot binding in China.  Like the permanent deformation of women’s feet caused by binding them from an early age, rearing children inside the echo chamber of creationism permanently deforms their minds, warping and distorting their perceptions of science and reality.  We cannot let that echo chamber take over the public schools unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a closing note: Regardless of where one stands on the accommodationist-hardass continuum, it’s one &lt;em&gt;helluva&lt;/em&gt; lot better for science education to have a Joel Walker on a school board than a Don McLeroy.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, posts that would have been just simple links and one-liners are now more likely to be found on Twitter (from which I import the feeds into FriendFeed and Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the April archives - lots of news and several excellent (or very funny) videos to be found there - but here are the "more serious" posts of the past month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there were several interesting events in April, often populated by friendly bloggers, e.g., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/seder.php" title=""&gt;Seder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/triangle_blogger_bash_at_dpac.php" title=""&gt;Triangle Blogger Bash at DPAC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/triangle_tweetup_tonight.php" title=""&gt;Triangle Tweetup Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most thoughtful (and perhaps provocative) post of the month was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/scienceonline09_-_saturday_430.php" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09 - Saturday 4:30pm and beyond: the Question of Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had long and interesting discussions in the comment threads of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/eliminate_peer-review_of_basel.php" title=""&gt;Eliminate peer-review of baseline grants entirely?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/why_eliminate_the_peer-review.php" title=""&gt;Why eliminate the peer-review of baseline grants?&lt;/a&gt; as well as on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/hey_you_cant_say_that_or_can_y.php" title=""&gt;Hey, You Can't Say That! Or can you?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still on my New Journalism track, I posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/journalists_vs_blogs_is_bad_fr.php" title=""&gt;'Journalists vs. Blogs' is bad framing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_journalistic_workflow.php" title=""&gt;New Journalistic Workflow&lt;/a&gt;. The latter explained, among else, the concept of Mindcasting, so I decided to try it out myself, and the result was a huge comment thread on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/do_you_love_or_hate_cilantro.php" title=""&gt;Do you love or hate Cilantro?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/boras_links_on_science_journal.php" title=""&gt;Bora's Links on (Science) Journalism&lt;/a&gt; for a reason that will be revealed to you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of newspapers, please check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/in_todays_papers.php" title=""&gt;In today's papers....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to science, I highlighted some very nice &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/the_scientist_special_topic_sl.php" title=""&gt;articles about sleep&lt;/a&gt;. and re-posted several posts from the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/friday_weird_sex_blogging/" title=""&gt;Friday Weird Sex Blogging&lt;/a&gt; archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely touched politics all month, except briefly in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/how_obama_usues_behavioral_eco.php" title=""&gt;How Obama uses Behavioral Economics to change our habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the professional side, I wrote about the new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/plos_one_collections.php" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE Collections&lt;/a&gt; and announced the very first &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/blog_post_of_the_month_at_plos.php" title=""&gt;Blog Post Of The Month at PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of PLoS, I have also been posting a lot on everyONE.com.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like you to consider writing to HuffPo with specific examples of their malfeasance, and asking them to consider altering their editorial policy on health issues, for the sake of morality, health, and humanity. In your own words.

Yeah, it&amp;#39;s not as fun as a knife fight, but you&amp;#39;ll get used to it, and you&amp;#39;ll save yourself from waiting in an ER with all those coughing people in masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241224788546"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-3555072768010607703">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01e3c58a0c1697b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Randomness" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Sick Sad People" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Autism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">You Win Some, You Lose Some</title><published>2009-05-02T00:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T00:01:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/05/so-after-work-i-stopped-at-borders.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SfuIU8ZtVPI/AAAAAAAAAkk/YyztSnivhOg/s1600-h/Best-Telemarketer-Prank-Ever.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:110px" title="Don&amp;#39;t worry, this will make sense later." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SfuIU8ZtVPI/AAAAAAAAAkk/YyztSnivhOg/s200/Best-Telemarketer-Prank-Ever.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So after class today I stopped at Borders. I picked up a copy of &lt;i&gt;The Unnatural Inquirer&lt;/i&gt; by Simon R. Green (who would be a guilty pleasure if I believed such a thing existed) and finally decided to try out this one that people have been raving about for two years, &lt;i&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/i&gt;. Hopefully it really is the Best Fantasy Novel Ever, like so many people have been saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, alas and alack, all was not well at Borders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had a prominent endcap titled in large letters "AUTISM." It drew me as poison from a wound. A quick perusal showed that the &lt;i&gt;entire endcap&lt;/i&gt; was full of woo. Jenny McCarthy woo. Her glassy-eyed presence stared out at me from among a sea of similar ignorant drivel. I decided to stage a peaceful protest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went to the "Medical" section and searched for a copy of Paul Offit's &lt;i&gt;Autism's False Prophets&lt;/i&gt; to put in place of Jenny McCarthy's &lt;i&gt;I Shat a Tiny Human Out My Vagina, Therefore I Am Right.&lt;/i&gt; At least I think that's what it was called. I could be wrong. My search was in vain; their "Medical" section was a hopelessly disorganized mess. I decided to take the expedient route and search their computerized catalogue thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Not In Store."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least three different books by Jenny McCarthy, Fighting Mother Scientist, but not a single copy of one of the few competent books on the subject of autism in recent years. The world is doomed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, well. Surely I have some small scrap of paper on my person, thought I, on which I can scrawl "This book is wrong. Jenny McCarthy is not a scientist." A quick pat down of my pockets revealed that, no, in fact, I did not. I was scrapless. I briefly considered just moving all of the books back to the shelf and leaving the endcap empty, but that seemed pointless and likely to get my kicked out before I could pay for my own books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At home later, my fiancée's phone rang. "God damn it," she exclaimed. "It's that number again."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"What number?" I inquired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's this number that keeps calling and whenever I pick up nobody is on the other end. It's really annoying."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quick reverse lookup garnered no results, but Google was much more fruitful. It turned up a page at the website 800notes.com, a user-driven catalogue of scammers, telemarketers, and other toll-free annoyances. Our number (866-379-2003, if you want to avoid it) turned out to be the number of something called &lt;a href="http://www.qualityresources.com/"&gt;Quality Resources Inc&lt;/a&gt;, which is, according to its website, "a leading performance-based customer acquisition marketing services provider," which, when translated from Scamese into English, apparently means "Intrusive assholes who somehow already have your credit card information and try to sell you on Acai berry juice and gas vouchers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I called them back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hello, this is High School Dropout Betty with Quality Resources, Inc. Your call may be recorded for our records."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Why do you keep calling this number incessantly, day in and day out, multiple times a day, and when somebody picks up there's nobody on the other end?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Is this Mr. [Fiancée's last name]?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hmm...More or less."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well, sir, if you have a problem, I--"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Look, whatever it is you're selling, we don't fucking want it," it was at this point that I began shouting, "and if you continue calling this number, &lt;i&gt;I will find you and jam your little headset so far up your ass that you'll have to learn to make a sales pitch with your duodenum!&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point during the italicized text she squawked something that might have been "Sir!" and then hung up on me. It's a shame she didn't get to hear about the duodenum. I thought that bit was rather clever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in the end, I think I made up for my inability to counteract the autism woo by being so balls-to-the-wall rude that &lt;i&gt;a telemarketer hung up on me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It helps that I've been awake since 11 o'clock last night. I probably couldn't have done that otherwise. I'm at that point of mental fatigue that is essentially equivalent to being somewhat intoxicated, and so my inhibitions are lower than normal; on a regular day, I wouldn't have even had the balls to call back. Today, I did it without a second thought. But I still fretted about the whole thing for about twenty minutes afterward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baby steps, baby steps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Postscript: A friend called shortly thereafter and I related the tale to him, and he told me about the time he found the publicly-listed office number of the president of a telemarketing company that had been badgering him and called it up. The president was out, so he convinced the secretary that he was just an old friend trying to catch up, and she was dumb enough to give him the guy's home phone number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friend then called Mr. President's house and yelled at his wife for twenty minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; dedication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-3555072768010607703?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241224031323"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/oh_really.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c13d4f404f7c24ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Oh really?</title><published>2009-05-02T00:39:17Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T00:39:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/AwNcinSc7yY/oh_really.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/oh_really.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a chat with a colleague today, I learned the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/oh_really.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/oh_really.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/AwNcinSc7yY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241219961239"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/deea821fe93578f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Hate Crimes Are Hate Crimes Are Hate Crimes...</title><published>2009-05-01T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This isn't my &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/just_because_im_quiet_doesnt_mean_i_dont_understand"&gt;"official" B.A.D.D. post&lt;/a&gt;, but it's definitely still in the spirit of the day--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aapd.com"&gt;AAPD&lt;/a&gt; put up a lovely &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/04/hate-crime-legislation-supported-by-civil-rights-community.html"&gt;page 'o quotes&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that goes to show that hate crimes based on &lt;a href="http://gayrights.change.org"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt; and hate crimes based on &lt;a href="http://womensrights.change.org"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; and hate crimes based on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org"&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt; and hate crimes based on race, color, religion, or national origin are all equally unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Too many times when heinous crimes are committed against people with disabilities, these offenses either go unreported or unprosecuted as hate crimes, even if the circumstances clearly show the victim was targeted because of a disability. AAPD strongly supports the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which, if passed, will help protect people with disabilities from those who commit violent, bias-motivated crimes by giving law enforcement resources to investigate and prosecute these crimes." --Andrew Imparato, President and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kev at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2253"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; reports that a woman and child had been been critically burned in an HBOT explosion in a Lauderdale-by-the-Sea medical facility. It's not clear if the child is autistic; the facility, the &lt;a href="http://www.oceanhbo.com/"&gt;Ocean Hyperbaric Neurological Center&lt;/a&gt; is said to have "&lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/sfl-hyperbaric-explosion-bn050109,0,1520166.story"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt;" treated &lt;a href="http://www.oceanhbo.com/client/ohc/list.htm"&gt;patients with cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;While some have offered &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_puzzling_array_of_autism_treatments"&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; about the effectiveness of HBOT in "treating" autism, HBOT is one of many experimental, unproven, biomedical treatments for autism---why is it that families willingly try "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20brod.html"&gt;anything and everything to 'treat' autism&lt;/a&gt;? Why put a child's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/questions_about_chelations_safety_arise_again"&gt;safety and even life&lt;/a&gt; at risk in the name of "treatment for autism"? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/parents-of-boy-who-died-after-chelation-sue-doctor-and-apothecure/"&gt;Abubakar Tariq Nadama&lt;/a&gt; died after receiving chelation treatment for autism in the office of Dr. Roy Kerry in Pennsylvania.  Is it because of the misperception that autism is "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autism-and-cancer/"&gt;worse than cancer&lt;/a&gt;"---worse than being critically burned, than death---that families continue to try such experimental treatments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our life with our son, as Jim and I noted at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_few_words_a_lotta_meaning"&gt;Charlie's IEP meeting&lt;/a&gt;, is often the other side of easy. As Jim said after the meeting in the middle school parking lot as we walked back to our car, it's the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;three of us&lt;/a&gt; and being together makes life good. Were we to lose any of our tight team of three---that would be a loss too much; that would be tragic. But autism itself---it's not a tragedy; what happened in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea earlier today is.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241209378910"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/envelope_please.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b0b5390ce895cc2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Envelope, please!</title><published>2009-05-01T20:34:40Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T20:34:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/SenMOodZDG8/envelope_please.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/envelope_please.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blog Post Of The Month for April 2009 &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/01/blog-post-of-the-month-april-2009/" title=""&gt;goes to&lt;/a&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/05/envelope_please.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/SenMOodZDG8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241208919625"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4252">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bdb2125a16b4a725</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="palaeospizabella" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Palaeospiza bella"/><category term="artile" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="artile"/><category term="cover" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="cover"/><category term="journal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="journal"/><title type="html">The Cover of The Auk</title><published>2009-05-01T20:21:01Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T20:21:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/the-cover-of-th.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lamm, a graduate student in bioinformatics at NCSU and a member of our lab, has made the cover of the latest issue of &lt;a href="http://www.aou.org/auk/" rel="external "&gt;The Auk&lt;/a&gt;, the official publication of the American Ornithologists’ Union, with her reconstruction of &lt;em&gt;Palaeospiza bella&lt;/em&gt;, a mousebird from the late Eocene found in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction goes along with the following article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ksepka DT‌ and Clarke JA (2009)‌ Affinities of &lt;em&gt;Palaeospiza bella&lt;/em&gt; and the Phylogeny and Biogeography of Mousebirds (Coliiformes). &lt;em&gt;The Auk&lt;/em&gt;  126(2): 245–259. [&lt;a href="http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/auk.2009.07178" rel="external "&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Palaeospiza bella&lt;/em&gt; was described as an oscine songbird in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The late Eocene age of the holotype specimen would make it the oldest Northern Hemisphere record of the Passeriformes. However, few recent workers have accepted the placement of &lt;em&gt;P. bella&lt;/em&gt; within Passeriformes, and the higher relationships of this fossil have remained controversial. We show that &lt;em&gt;P. bella&lt;/em&gt; is a member of the Coliiformes (mousebirds) and represents the latest North American occurrence of a clade with an exclusively African extant distribution. Coliiformes are now known from the latest Paleocene to the approach of the Eocene–Oligocene boundary in North America. We present a redescription of &lt;em&gt;P. bella&lt;/em&gt; and a new phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living Coliiformes based on a matrix including 49 characters and 18 ingroup taxa. The results of this analysis place &lt;em&gt;P. bella&lt;/em&gt; in Colii, the clade comprising taxa more closely related to Coliidae (crown mousebirds) than to the extinct Sandcoleidae. The oldest stem-group Coliiformes are late Paleocene (about 56.2–56.6 Ma) in age. However, no fossil taxon can be confidently placed within the crown clade Coliidae at present. Phylogenetic results imply that a minimum of three mousebird dispersals from Europe to North America occurred during the Early Cenozoic. Review of the early Eocene fossil &lt;em&gt;Eocolius walkeri&lt;/em&gt; from the London Clay shows that this taxon lacks convincing coliiform synapomorphies and should be removed from the clade.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This post contains a headline so completely moronic I can’t even say it here on Skepchick, so please &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/05/01/skepchick_saint_misbehavin.php"&gt;just go there now and read it&lt;/a&gt;. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, the comments this week made me laugh so often that I COULD NOT PICK JUST ONE COMMENT O’ THE WEEK. That’s right: we have two winners. Two! Read on to find out who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elyse asked you people to tell her why gay marriage was ruining your lives, you brought the hilarity. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7054&amp;amp;cpage=2#comment-58970"&gt;SaraDee’s comment&lt;/a&gt; came thiiiis close to winning, but in the end I went with the one that got an absolute landslide of votes: &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7054&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-58921"&gt;Merkuto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merkuto&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3d228396cc5cda5ba2f4c91887fa7d5?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Apr 27, 2009 at 3:35 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I KNOW gay marriage is wrong, because God has blessed me with the Rod of Judgment. Whenever I see something TRULY shameful in the eyes of the Lord, he reaches down and points at the sinful exhibition with my 3 inches of Divine Wrath. When an unmarried couple are gettin’ hot and steamy, in preperation for their eternity in hell, my angry trouser-trouper in God’s eternal army points them out. When two ho-mo-sexuals are witnessed in socket-on-socket action, or joining up their extension cords, the Lord makes his anger known with my MIGHTY, MIGHTY Erection of Engorged Righteousness! Basking in the Lords love, witnessing these sins, I’m ready for the Eternal Lord and Father to take me right now, RIGHT NOW, up in heaven. I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Take me Jesus! Take me! I will eat of your flesh and drink your bodily fluids until the end of time, only place it upon my tongue, and I will be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean really, have you ever read a more blatant attempt to win Comment o’ the Week? ANSWER: YES YOU HAVE read a more blatant attempt. That attempt was made by our second winner, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7041&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-59199"&gt;Gabrielbrawley&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabrielbrawley&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e68ba16febd65d083b2038ed7ba8a359?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Apr 30, 2009 at 1:30 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I have ever cited any material of any kind. I am not a professional academic and the comments that I post here are not in a paper that will be reviewed by a professor or a journal for publication. Also, I am, like almost everyone else here, engaged in another life that takes place outside of the cyber realms. I am often squeezing a comment in between taking care of the kids, making dinner or helping with homework. Then again many of my comments are food or booze related. So I am not sure what source material I would sight. Foodnetwork.com says that bleu cheese is great and that you are a very wrong person if you don’t like it? Something like that maybe. I am really just trying to come up with something so witty, so full of sexual innuendo and skeptical goodness that it will win the COTW and I can ask the AI on Wednesday. I already know the question. “Where on the web can I see your boobies?” I mean what AI could follow that? We would have to shut the whole process down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the prize for our winner(s) is to choose next Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition. In this case, the Wednesday AI will have two questions, one of which will be Gabriel’s above-mentioned choice. &lt;strong&gt;Merkuto&lt;/strong&gt;, please &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;send me your question&lt;/a&gt;, which may or may not have anything to do with Gabriel’s! Both will go live next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats and happy Friday everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s AI was inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/04/30/kenya.sex.ban/index.html"&gt;the story in the quickies &lt;/a&gt;about Kenyan women witholding sex as a protest.

Last year, we were introduced to  &lt;a href="http://climateethics.org/"&gt;“climate ethics”&lt;/a&gt;, whose mission it is to focus on the &lt;em&gt;ethical dimensions&lt;/em&gt; of climate change. Now there is &lt;a href="http://www.realclimateeconomics.org/"&gt;“RealClimateEconomics”&lt;/a&gt;, whose aim it is to focus on the &lt;em&gt;economic considerations&lt;/em&gt; surrounding climate change. Neither this site nor climateethics.org has any formal relationship with RealClimate, despite the similarity in name.  We do nonetheless welcome them to the fray.

&lt;p&gt;To those disgusting people, I say: blecccchhhh and ewwwww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3491799592/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3591/3491799592_2c6e7f1cc8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, that’s really bad logic. First, this isn’t about you, it’s about the people who use the bathroom or other utensils after you do; &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are the ones getting &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; germs on and in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; bodies. Second, your stories are anecdotal, and not based on real data. Third, it’s a fallacy: just because you haven’t gotten sick doesn’t mean you &lt;strong&gt;can’t&lt;/strong&gt;. You need that real data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12726975"&gt;a meta-analysis of studies&lt;/a&gt; of people who washed their hands with soap versus those who didn’t shows that washing with soap can reduce the risk of intestinal infections and diarrhea by about 50%! When extrapolated over the population, simply washing hands with soap and water &lt;em&gt;could save one million lives&lt;/em&gt; over the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can brag all you want about how you just love getting feces on your fingers and then leaving it all over doorknobs, telephones, pencils, and everything else you touch, but the facts are against you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wash your hands. The life you save &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be your own, but it may also be that of someone you love. &lt;/p&gt;

It was one of those show-your-cards moments where, finally, at long last, the ID movement’s endless wild claims about the emptiness of evolutionary biology were put into direct conflict with the weight of the evidence.  Everything was crystallized into a short episode – an amazing field of research (the 100+ years of discovery about the function and origins of the immune system), an amazing practical application of evolutionary biology (both common ancestry and variation/selection played absolutely critical roles in developing science’s understanding of the immune system), and a really obvious put-up-or-shut-up moment for the ID movement’s “irreducible complexity” argument, where it completely failed to put up (&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/luskin-and-the-2.html" rel=""&gt;here’s a review of the ping-pong game the ID movement played with “IC systems”, and how the immune system cross called their bluff&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the cross has gotten plenty of attention and all of the details are &lt;a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=124" rel="external "&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, but it is gratifying that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/324/5927/580" rel="external "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine has devoted one of its “Origins” essays to the history of immunology&lt;/a&gt;, the role played by Darwinian ideas (both common ancestry and variation/selection), and highlights the Perry Mason immunology moment from the Kitzmiller case.  It also provides an update on the science, and comprehensive links.&lt;/p&gt;

NASA has &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; which will blast off no earlier than June 2, and &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0907.html"&gt;the Hubble servicing mission&lt;/a&gt; for the Space Shuttle &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; is now scheduled for launch on May 11. I’ll have lots more about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMB9SANJTF_index_0.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/herschel_planck.jpg" alt="Herschel and Planck"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herschel and Planck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Space Agency isn’t exactly taking it easy, either: &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMB9SANJTF_index_0.html"&gt;Herschel and Planck&lt;/a&gt; are two astronomy missions that will launch on a single Ariane 5 rocket on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Herschel/index.html"&gt;Herschel&lt;/a&gt; is a massive infrared telescopic observatory with a 3.5 meter mirror, by far the largest infrared observatory ever put in space. It will look at far-infrared light, from 55 to 672 microns (our eyes are sensitive to light out to roughly 0.7 microns, so this is way out in the IR). For comparison, the awesome &lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml"&gt;Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; telescope has a mirror 0.85 meters across, so Herschel will return incredible imagery of the sky. I can’t wait to see what it shows us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Planck/index.html"&gt;Planck&lt;/a&gt; will map the entire sky at microwave frequencies, looking at the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. The NASA satellite &lt;a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;WMAP&lt;/a&gt; did this a few years back and answered many questions about the physics of the early Universe, but as we have to come to expect in science, any new observations will also raise even more questions. Planck will have &lt;em&gt;ten times&lt;/em&gt; the resolution that WMAP did, so it will see smaller features on the sky. It’s also more sensitive than WMAP was, so it will see fainter features as well. This means it may answer a lot of those questions WMAP raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get this: the Big Bang model is the best one we have to explain the origin of the Universe. But it does not tell us about how that moment occurred. Did the Universe get its start from a singular event, a quantum fluctuation in some larger metaverse? Are we the last in a series of past Big Bangs and recollapses (the last because we’re pretty sure the cosmic expansion will go on forever this time)? Are we here because two high-dimensional membranes collided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/080997/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/wmap_cmb.jpg" alt="WMAP CMB"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMAP map of the microwave sky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions stretch our brains to the breaking point… but the thing is, there is science here! &lt;a href="http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/02/11/pages/1393/index.xml?page=2&amp;amp;"&gt;These different ideas predict different structures in the background glow leftover from the Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;. WMAP saw many cooler and warmer spots on the sky in that microwave glow, equal numbers of them. But some theories say we should see just a hair more cold spots. WMAP did a fine job observing the sky, but it simply lacked the resolution to be able to see any asymmetries in the hot and cold spot numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planck may very well have the resolution needed to see that. Do you understand the implications? &lt;strong&gt;We may be on the verge of determining if the origin of the Universe was a singular event, or if it was due to some other mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re on the edge of &amp;quot;holy crap!&amp;quot; territory with this. We have progressed from last century’s having no clue about how the cosmos got its start, to now possibly being able to get a handle &lt;em&gt;on what happened before the Big Bang&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I love science! Some people try to tell me that science will never answer the big questions we have in life. To them I say: baloney! The real problem is &lt;em&gt;your questions aren’t big enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241198231580"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/what_to_do_about_huffpo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b439dc9f1adc4875</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">What to do about the Huffington Post's support for anti-vaccine nonsense and quackery?</title><published>2009-05-01T17:52:07Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T17:52:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/-0YW96DTWn0/what_to_do_about_huffpo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/what_to_do_about_huffpo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been complaining about the antivaccine lunacy at The Huffington Post for a very long time--since a mere two or three weeks after The Huffington Post first came into existence, when it had already become apparent that, in terms of health coverage, HuffPo was nothing more than &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;Arianna's Happy Home for Loony Antivaccinationists&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, I've become even more disturbed by the appearance of outright quackery, such as recommending &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;colon cleanses and "detox" to fight infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; and the boosting of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;homeopathy and the quackery that is the Beck Protocol&lt;/a&gt; as treatments for swine flu and antibiotic-resistant "superbugs." Some of us have wondered whether this is because&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt; the new "Wellness Editor" of HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; is a homeopath and "alternative" practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog bud PalMD has a suggestion: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/vendetta.php"&gt;Vendetta!&lt;/a&gt; (although I'm not sure that what he describes is exactly a vendetta). In fact, compared to the title of his post, what he actually describes seems rather calm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd like you to consider writing to &lt;a href="mailto:info@huffingtonpost.com"&gt;HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; with specific examples of their malfeasance, and asking them to consider altering their editorial policy on health issues, for the sake of morality, health, and humanity. In your own words.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I understand the sentiment, sadly, I don't think that it will do much good. The antivaccine nonsense, for example, has been very deeply ingrained in HuffPo blogging culture from the very beginning. I highly doubt, for instance, that Arianna would ever kick Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. off of HuffPo or allow any of her editors to do so. He's just too high profile a liberal voice. Similarly, given how the influx of outright quackery has coincided with the tenure of the new "wellness editor," I highly doubt that, short of removing her, any level of complaints will dislodge the quacks. I'd love to be wrong, but I fear I'm not, which is why I don't think it's a bad idea at least to try to deluge the editors with complaints about the recent spike in quackery blogging on HuffPo, the most irresponsible and utterly opportunistic of which are the claims by various charlatans that homeopathy or "detox" regimens can protect you from the swine flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what else can we do, other than continue to ruthlessly mock the quackery in HuffPo whenever it rises to a certain level? Or is that what HuffPo wants, given that attention, good or bad, drives traffic its way?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/what_to_do_about_huffpo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/-0YW96DTWn0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241197835745"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-66248969">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19e9d0fde88eb622</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religious Idiocy" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Pew Survey" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><category term="torture" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Christians Justify Torture</title><published>2009-05-01T16:48:20Z</published><updated>2009-05-02T20:36:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/05/christians-justify-torture-pew-survey.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/05/christians-justify-torture-pew-survey.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several bloggers have commented on the recent Pew Survey on whether or not different religious groups support torture. Interestingly, the question they asked was unequivocal – there were no euphemisms such as “enhanced interrogation” or yes it is / no it isn’t terms like “waterboarding”.  The question was &lt;a href="http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=156"&gt;unequivocally about torture&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you think the use of torture against suspected terrorists in order to gain important information can often be justified, sometimes be justified, rarely be justified, or never be justified?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results by religious grouping below clearly shows that the more Christian you are, the more likely you are to think that torture was justified:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=156" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Torture" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f6dabc5970c-800wi" title="Torture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how statistically significant these results are. The numbers questioned in the attend religious services “weekly”, “monthly…” and “seldom or never” were 336, 225 and 168 respectively. That seems a little low to be used for drawing too many conclusions, although I could be wrong. If anyone has the statistical know-how to crunch the numbers and calculate statistical significance I’d be very interested. Also, the number supporting torture in the less religious groups is still fairly high in my view. Torture was justified at least “sometimes” by around 40% of the “unaffiliated” and “attend religious services seldom or never” groups. That compares with 54% to 62% of the religious groups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, significant or not, these results hardly support the view that religion (specifically Christianity) provides a moral compass, or that reading the Bible or going to church is necessary for one to be moral or good. And, really, should this surprise anyone? Consider what the “good book”, aka The Word Of God has to say about the use of torture. Just a few snippets:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property. &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/ex/21.html#20"&gt;Exodus 21:20-21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, you say, but that was just for slaves. Slaves are property, right? But it wasn&amp;#39;t just slaves. Look what David did (with God’s approval) to all the inhabitants of several cities:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/2sam/12.html#31"&gt;2 Samuel 12:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hum, saws, harrows, axes, the brick-kiln - well at least they didn&amp;#39;t waterboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus approved of the practice:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. And that servant, which knew his lord&amp;#39;s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/lk/12.html#46"&gt;Luke 12:46-48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh that Jesus - such a barrel of fun. But then, he got it from his dad:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/rev/9.html#5"&gt;Revelation 9:5-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much more at the Skeptic’s Annotated Bible’s &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/torture.html"&gt;What the Bible says about Torture&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This survey really shouldn’t surprise anyone.

It’s a pervasive mental illness that has caused me to severely reduce my participation there and remove some of the major tech blogs from my list of daily &amp;quot;must reads&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, this particular problem isn’t by any means endemic to Hacker News. It occurs at the crossroads where a bunch of smart people meet general tech industry discussion. I’m sure there are plenty of places that suffer from Hacker News Disease (and they probably had it first, have a terminal case of it, and are much less civil about it too) but HN is just the only one I’ve participated in, so they have the misfortune of being the community I’ve named it after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease has two primary symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Repeatedly mistaking intelligence for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The belief that anybody not in the tech industry is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is endemic to all smart people (but no brilliant ones). People tend to overvalue the skills they have, and undervalue the ones they don’t. Even the most knowledgeable, intelligent people around are rarely experts in more than one or maybe two unrelated subject areas. The sum of human knowledge is vast, and while smart people often believe they could become an expert in any of them individually if they only had the time and inclination, the relatively short number of years we have on this planet precludes them from mastering more than a very small portion of them. So smart people have a lot of intelligence, but still only a tiny amount of knowledge, which causes them to overvalue the former at the expense of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry, however, overlaps with just about every subject area known to man on a daily basis. Follow a handful of the better tech publications and topics such as law, politics, entertainment, economics, biology, real estate, sales, design, and psychology are just a few that pop up every time you open your RSS reader. It’s hard to find a sizable industry that hasn’t been drastically altered by the technological advances of the last twenty years, or won’t be by the next twenty either, so it’s not at all surprising that the people in the industry like to talk about those changes as they progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes when people don’t know what they don’t know. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen someone post a legal question on Hacker News, and get dozens of replies from people who aren’t attorneys. They feel qualified to have an opinion because they’re smart, and lots of the tech articles they read have a legal slant to them, and I guess it’s easy to mistake TechCrunch for education. The fact that they’ve never taken even an introductory law class doesn’t stop them from assuming they’ve got it figured out enough to offer advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same happens in every field imaginable, to the point where I almost wish the site made everyone post verified credentials just so that if anyone with actual knowledge ever responded to a question, you’d be able to filter that signal out from the overpowering noise. Generally what happens though is I click on the commenters’ profiles a few times just to find they’re some 20 year-old programmer working on a new website for people to share music and then I give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The wise man knows he doesn’t know. The fool doesn’t know he doesn’t know.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(Lao Tzu)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In and of itself this wouldn’t be insidious, because at least the fools are well-meaning, and usually polite too. People mostly don’t offer psychological or legal or health advice over the internet in an attempt to do harm. They mean to help, and they simply don’t realize that harm (and little good) could come of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is where it intersects with the second symptom, which is the belief that everyone not in the tech industry is stupid. This is pervasive in the tech media, and in the industry as a whole. A hundred times each day you come across someone saying that &amp;quot;These record label execs are suing people! They’re idiots and they just don’t get it.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;These newspaper editors are trying to charge for online content! They’re idiots and they just don’t get it.&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;These clowns from Fox and NBC who run Hulu don’t want their videos showing up on Boxee! They’re idiots and they just don’t get it&amp;quot;. Or &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=586100"&gt;Warner is picking a fight with Lawrence Lessig? What are they, idiots?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never seems to occur to anyone that perhaps the people they think are stupid really aren’t, and perhaps (in reality, almost for certain) the people being commented about are just as smart as and know far more about the situation than the ones doing the commenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of the last one if you click the link above. While I’ve been thinking of this post for months, it took me staying home sick for a bit to actually use the site enough to inspire me, and then give me the time to write it. In the thread, people who aren’t IP lawyers argue the finer points of fair use, and assert that Warner is nuts for messing with Lessig. The following scenario never seems to occur to any of them, and they even balk at it when it’s mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Warner has an army of highly paid, very smart and very knowledgeable IP attorneys, who all know way more about the situation than anyone who has ever even seen Hacker News, because while the people on Hacker News were studying programming, the equally smart Warner attorneys were studying intellectual property law and working on high-profile IP law cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Said attorneys (all of whom know exactly who Lawrence Lessig is, and are more familiar with his work than anyone on Hacker News) carefully examined the case, and decided for whatever reason to issue a DMCA take down notice which, by the way, is not a lawsuit, or even remotely close to one, and was issued to YouTube rather than Lessig, though you’d quickly lose sight of those facts when reading anything written about the whole affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. It occurred to the attorneys that Lessig would fight this, because anyone who has ever read anything by Lessig would know that, and as I mentioned before, the attorneys in question are not retarded. Thus they issued the takedown notice because they wanted him to fight it, or at least don’t really care if he does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Because they’re smart lawyers, who are experts on IP law (because that’s their job) and who issued a takedown notice to Lawrence Lessig that they wanted and expected him to fight, there’s a strong chance Warner has something serious to gain from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not saying any of that is the case. For all I know, this was all just done by some automated software or a low-level grunt whose job it is to find Warner IP on YouTube and issue takedown notices, in which case it will likely blow over and isn’t worth discussing in the first place. Lessig might appeal the takedown, at which point an actual attorney might review it and decide whether or not it’s important enough for them to worry about. I really have no idea there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also possible they’re looking for a fight, and if they are, you can be 100% sure it’s because they understand what they’re getting into and think they can win it. And if they think they can win it, there’s a good chance they’re right because they aren’t stupid. In fact they’re probably very bright, and they are very knowledgeable about and experienced in the subject area. If I had to bet on one side or the other, I’d bet on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That never occurred to a single person in the entire tech industry though, because they think anyone who can’t code an iPhone app, or doesn’t at least have the common sense to work mostly with people who can, is an idiot. So they go off spouting about how &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090428/1738424686.shtml"&gt;Not Smart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; Warner is, or how they’re in danger of setting some sort of &lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=586345"&gt;precedent&lt;/a&gt; that is disadvantageous to themselves (how they’d manage that with a DMCA take down notice is anyone’s guess) and how they’re &lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=586434"&gt;shooting themselves in the foot&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;if they lose, which I think they will despite my not being a lawyer&amp;quot;. It never occurs to them that the people who are a lawyer might be a little better at making that judgment, or even that not being a lawyer might make you a fool for even having an opinion on intricate legal matters such as who would win a case about Fair Use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, I think the belief in the stupidity of people in other industries comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which people are compensated and therefore motivated. Take, for instance, the most flagrant example of this in recent years: the music industry. Over the last decade, they’ve fought technology tooth and nail, despite the fact that any teenager in 1999 could tell you it was a losing battle. It’s easy to look at what appears to be people tilting at windmills and see stupidity, but what you realize if you dig a little deeper is that they’re largely just intelligent people reacting in a rational manner to their own incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you’re the CEO of a publicly traded record label circa 2000 and Napster is taking off. You realize that P2P file sharing is going to make a big dent in your sales increasingly over the next decade. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two options. Behind door number one is fundamentally restructuring your entire company. Remember, this is still years before the iPod achieved the sort of ubiquity that led to the iTunes store and eventual copycats, so at this point, there doesn’t seem to be any real hope of long-term music sales. The CD is plainly marked for extinction, to be replaced by digital downloads, most of which will be traded from one person to another for free. You can see right away that revenues are going to have to come from something else down the line, like product placement in music videos, live performances, etc. You don’t know what you’ll be making money off of in 10 or 20 years, or how much, or even if you’ll be able to make any at all, because really you’re nothing but a middleman between the artist and the fans and maybe, just maybe, the internet is going to cut you out the way it did to computer retailers when Dell took over that industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can sue every corporation that tries to get in on the P2P game, which won’t save you the end, but will definitely disorganize the community enough to staunch the bleeding for awhile, possibly a long while. (It’s actually done far better than most of us ever would have guessed.) You’re not stupid; you know that every time you obliterate one Napster another Kazaa will just pop up in its place, but between suing each one out of business and scaring customers by suing a few of them too, you’ll at least be able to hang on to something for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hell, the average tenure of an executive at a large corporation is only 5 or 6 years and you’ve already been on the job for two. You’re getting paid a huge salary with tons of stock options that vest over a relatively short period (such as 2 or 3 years) with a strike price low enough that your shares can slowly sink and you’ll still make millions for as long as you keep your board happy enough to not fire you, which you’ll do by pointing out that despite millions more people stealing your product daily, you’re still bringing in almost as much money as you did last year, and if you can just have a little more time you’ll sue your way back to revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? Do you destroy your major source of revenue, that’s brining in hundreds of millions of dollars annually, because you realize it’s going to die one way or another in the next 10-20 years and you might as well get on with it, and then start giving away the music for free and scrounging for ways to monetize in the hopes that some time, long after you’ve moved on to run a car company or a retail chain, your record label will be the one left standing? Or do you use your legal muscle to keep revenues as high as you can for as long as you can and keep collecting your multi-million-dollar salary and options package while doing lines off of naked starlets on the weekends before you move on to run a car company or a retail chain? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at it from that perspective, it’s a no-brainer. You sue everyone and everything you can. If a 65 year old woman’s grandson downloads a CD of songs from Sesame Street on her computer, you sue her, sue the kid who spawned the little bastard, take the grandkid to juvenile court, and sue everyone on their block just for being within a reasonable proximity. Then you have your PR department spread the word that file sharing is illegal and if you do it, or ever even shake hands with anyone who did, we’re going to take your retirement, your house, your car, and even your $3 Timex wristwatch just like we did to this little old lady, and you’ll be spending your golden years working a second job at McDonald’s just to pay off what you owe us, all because you just &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to have that Britney Spears CD but couldn’t pay $9.99 for it like a good law-abiding citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what they did, and it’s what I’d do too, and I have standardized tests to prove that I’m at least not an idiot. But everyone in the tech industry just assumes they’re stupid and they don’t get it. They’re not, and they do. It’s just that they don’t get paid to get it. Getting it isn’t what pays the mortgage on a $20 million mansion in Beverly Hills and the lease on a yacht. The job of getting it and actually doing something about it will fall to the next guy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, a decade later, the next guys are taking over the record labels, TV networks, and movie studios, and we’re seeing things like Last.fm and Hulu and &lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/2007/11/13/the-future-of-the-recording-industry/"&gt;360 degree music contracts&lt;/a&gt; which I said were going to be the future of that industry a year before anyone else. They’re adapting to the changing situation because the new guys, unlike the old ones, get paid for that. Their market caps are sinking faster than their boards can reprice the executives’ options, and the investors finally realize that all of the king’s lawyers can’t put Humpty Dumpty back together again, so they have to be patient and plan for the long term. And that restructuring is what we’re seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone on both sides of the coin wants to work this out, because there’s enough gold there for all of us. But for those of us in the tech industry, if we’re going to get there we’re going to have to realize that they’re smart too, and they know things we don’t, just as we know things they don’t. We have to work together, and leverage their knowledge of how to produce quality content, which they do better than anyone in the world, with our knowledge of how to package it up and deliver it to consumers in the most appealing manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when Hulu says they don’t want their content appearing on Boxee, or Warner issues a take down notice, or the RIAA sues our favorite music startup, instead of calling them idiots and assuming they’re out of touch with their customers and the changing world they live in, we should realize they have smart, knowledgeable people who know much that we don’t putting a lot of thought into what they’re doing, ask why, and see if we can find a workable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a long, bumpy road, and some of the industries (like music) that are struggling to keep up with the times will probably fare much better than others (like newspapers) in the end. We in the tech industry will do our best to step up and fill the gap, and try to make it work for everyone, but to do it well we’re going to have to stop assuming that everyone else is stupid and doesn’t get it. We’re going to have to inoculate ourselves against Hacker News Disease and work on meaningful solutions together. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241194532381"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/just_because_im_quiet_doesnt_mean_i_dont_understand">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e282527a6ff418dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Just Because I'm Quiet Doesn't Mean I Don't Understand</title><published>2009-05-01T16:11:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T16:11:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/just_because_im_quiet_doesnt_mean_i_dont_understand" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;[2009 &lt;a href="http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2009/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html"&gt;Blogging Against Disablism Day&lt;/a&gt; submission]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2009/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html"&gt;&lt;img title="Blogging Against Disablism Day, May 1st 2009" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aQ1h56WoARI/RiR-V4_3yrI/AAAAAAAAAFw/F-efgSUbcM0/s320/bad02.gif" border="0" alt="Blogging Against Disablism Day, May 1st 2009" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About a year ago, coming home from doing an invited presentation at a national scientific conference (&lt;a href="http://aaidd.org"&gt;AAIDD&lt;/a&gt;'s annual meeting if you're interested), I listened while the two middle-aged businessmen sitting in my row discussed, loudly, their misfortune at being forced to sit near me.  "Well, at least it's a short ride," they consoled each other.  I was unable to form words, too tired to pull out my communication device to set them straight, but believe me, I understood the message of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Blackman writes in her book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucys-Story-Autism-Other-Adventures/dp/1843100428"&gt;Lucy's Story&lt;/a&gt;, "My giggling, hand-biting, angry-singing days seemed to the staff [at the school] to be more frequent than my interactive cooperative ones.  They could not know that my comprehension was good enough for me to be distressed by television news or even drama, such as the episode in Holocaust where intellectually disabled people were loaded into a gas wagon."  Lucy Blackman also understood the message of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular autism &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Every_Day"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; included a mother saying, in front of her autistic daughter, that the only reason why she didn't kill her autistic daughter was because of a non-autistic sibling.  Perhaps that girl too understood the message of discrimination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And two days ago at the state capital, I listened to an hour and a half of invited and public testimony in front of the House Education Committee which included gems like, "He was so normal looking...if only he hadn't been so normal looking, it wouldn't have mattered so much that he was self injurious."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I'll give a moment here for the urge to vomit (or perhaps the actual vomit) at that horror to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These too, all these: messages of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Much of that was really hard to listen to," another self-advocate started her testimony off-script, responding directly, not quietly, to the message of discrimination.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand.  We have feelings that can be hurt.  She spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not to be discussed in the third person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not to be discussed as objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not to be discussed as though we are not really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat at the speakers' table with my spankin' new &lt;a href="http://proloquo2go.com"&gt;ultra portable speech device&lt;/a&gt; and pressed the right buttons, "It is important that the state of Oregon consult with the cross-disability community regarding media, policy language, and promotional materials related to autism and other developmental disabilities.  Like any minority, we need input into how we are being represented in order to combat stigma."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed the right buttons, "Nothing about us, without us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether I/we have the ability to press those buttons or not, whether I/we am/are silent or screaming, either way, believe me, I/we understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I deserve discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241194134238"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/friday_sprog_blogging_life_sci.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8bcac5dd65383706</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Critters"/><title type="html">Friday Sprog Blogging: life science from two points of view.</title><published>2009-05-01T17:02:57Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T17:02:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/CiPL_eoA-_U/friday_sprog_blogging_life_sci.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/friday_sprog_blogging_life_sci.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/upload/2009/05/HaPonyHaMonkey.jpg" width="350" height="269" alt="HaPonyHaMonkey.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It being spring and all, the Free-Ride offspring sometimes get that wistful &lt;i&gt;why-aren't-we-4H-kids?&lt;/i&gt; look in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that there aren't critters aplenty in the back yard.  The younger Free-Ride offspring sizes up the ladybugs and looks for a jar with holes in the lid that would be appropriate as a ladybug barn.  (Then, I point out that the ladybugs are needed in the garden, right where they are, to keep the aphid population under control.)  Most mornings, we have a delightful selection of colorful birds hopping around and eating (bugs, one assumes) right out our window.  There are enough gastropods to set up a snail racetrack (although I'm not sure we could get licensed to accept bets on the races).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these children seem to want more.  This morning, they presented me with pictures of the sorts of critter encounters they've been dreaming of.&lt;br&gt;

You know already what kind of idiotic tripe he's going to trot out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of the so-called 'swine flu' demonstrates yet again how useless and sometimes deadly a mutation can be. Furthermore, as the infection spreads around the world, the search for an antidote is desperately sought, but the very fact that the virus is seen as something to be opposed actually supports the Biblical view of this world. It is always good and right to oppose sickness, but in evolutionary terms, why don't humans simply resign themselves to it and allow the strong to survive? The evolutionary point of view would say the virus has a 'right' to live, so 'good luck' to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wrong can he be? It's hard to imagine screwing it up more. In the evolutionary point of view, we are the children of ancestors who fought off disease and lived to procreate; those who surrender to a viruses imaginary right to live, if such imaginary beings ever existed, didn't make much of a contribution to the current gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you might wonder, what will the Ray Comforts of the world do to fight the virus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great hope for this fallen, diseased, weatherworn world, is the return of Christ, who has promised to bring restoration, everlasting health and peace to all people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If waiting for Jesus is his only answer, he can join his fantasy evilutionists in the graveyard. But he&amp;#39;s lying here, because we know what will happen if Comfort feels the stirrings of the flu — he&amp;#39;ll scurry to his nearest doctor to take advantage of the work of scientists who don&amp;#39;t think the only hope is to cry out to Jebus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the contrast: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2009/05/why_swine_flu_is_resistant_to.php"&gt;Nick Anthis describes the molecular mechanism of the flu's resistance to some of the drugs in our arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, he doesn&amp;#39;t cite the Bible even once, nor does he beg for mercy from a merciful deity. He does cite the scientific literature, though, and explains the natural, material processes — those mutations — that have contributed to the potency of this strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who contributes more to the health and happiness of the people of this world, scientists or bible-thumpin' idjits?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/a_little_study_in_contrasts.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/LleIpQKVirc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241192453273"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3583">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4d6d0390dc7f5f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="japan"/><category term="scarab"/><category term="beetle"/><category term="LOL"/><category term="Scarabaeidae"/><category term="Kabutomushi"/><category term="Dynastinae"/><title type="html">Scarab Beetle with Laser Bra!</title><published>2009-05-01T15:40:35Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T15:40:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/scarab-beetle-with-laser-bra/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoa.  I had no idea there was a version of Spiderman from Japan.  I can’t embed the video, but &lt;strong&gt;TRUST ME&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid16671792001?bctid=14705921001"&gt;You need to click through and watch &lt;em&gt;at least &lt;/em&gt;the first 4 minutes of this&lt;/a&gt;.  And it just keeps getting odder.&lt;a href="http://www.bookspotcentral.com/2009/04/japanese-spider-man-motion-accessory-is-a-loveful-beetle-insect-spy/"&gt;&lt;img title="laserbra" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/laserbra.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=206" alt="laserbra" width="300" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about it is that, once again, Jon Stewart and company have taken an issue that completely flummoxed most major news media — in this case, the purported danger that the LHC will destroy the world — and actually get it right.  In addition to visiting CERN itself, Oliver scored an interview with &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2008/03/29/taking-particle-physics-to-court/"&gt;Walter Wagner&lt;/a&gt; (”graduated UC Berkeley with a Minor in Physics”), originator of much of the hysteria and lawsuits.  You’ll get to hear Wagner explain that the probability the LHC will destroy the world is — wait for it — fifty percent.  You know, because when you have two things that can possibly happen, obviously each has half the probability, right?  I don’t want to say too much about Walter Wagner, because, if nothing else, the guy is really fond of a good lawsuit.  So I have no comment whatsoever on Walter Wagner’s competence or sanity.

The initial results of this one, before all of you readers get to work and use your magic clicky fingers, is mildly interesting. The readership of Christianity Today consists primarily of scientific illiterates and wishful dreamers, split between people who seriously believe the earth is 6000 years old, those who think the Bible is a science text and are willing to stretch a metaphor, and fuzzy thinkers who want a god to have guided natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine the readership here can rock their little world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislative session so far has not been kind to the State Board of Education.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Senate confirmation of Board Chairman Don McLeroy, R-College Station, is dead in the water, the Nominations Committee chairman said Thursday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The House of Representatives approved a constitutional amendment Monday that would move the investment decisions about the $17.5 billion Permanent School Fund away from the board to an appointed council of financial professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And a bipartisan group of senators has introduced a bill to take away the elected board's authority over curriculum and textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're feeling the heat.

Really, what are the odds? [BTW He's using my book in his class on atheism]. Ed Babinski sent me a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17199_7-most-horrifying-parasites-on-planet.html"&gt;7 Most Horrifying Parasites On the Planet&lt;/a&gt;. God is perfectly good, right? That site has many other interesting things on it you could spend a lot of time reading. William Lobdell's book, &lt;em&gt;Losing My Religion&lt;/em&gt; was just recently given a rave review in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/books/review/Oppenheimer-t.html?8bu&amp;amp;emc=bua2"&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations William! My own book will be reviewed by the overseas equivalent, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-do-london-times-society-of.html"&gt;The Literary Times Supplement&lt;/a&gt;. Bruce Droppings recently reviewed an interview of Pastor Dave Schmelzer and me where he says he was &lt;a href="http://brucedroppings.com/2009/04/24/john-loftus-and-dave-schmelzer-podcast/"&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out to see why.

I used to imagine the light hitting the moon or traveling through space for a long time. Years later I realized that this was silly. The atmosphere is like a sponge for such feeble sources of light. Between diffraction, absorption and other interactions not one photon would likely make it out.  Now I’m finding out I may have been right when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas Ringwald and his colleagues at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, claim that with the right preparation and if you shine a flashlight at the ground, some photons may actually come out of the other side of the planet. This has caused plethora of articles to be titled something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20090427/981/tsc-hidden-photons-may-be-used-to-send-s.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20090427/981/tsc-hidden-photons-may-be-used-to-send-s.html"&gt;Photons may be used to send secret emails through Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these are no ordinary photons, they’re called Hidden Photons because they uh… they hide really well I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, they didn’t pull these photons out of their butts, Supersymmetry actually predicts them.&lt;br&gt;
I never really liked this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supersymmetry is the hypothesis that there is a symmetry between bosons and fermions. All elementary particles are either bosons or fermions (depending on their spin). Bosons are force carriers like photons (which mediate electromagnetic interactions). Fermions are simply all matter particles plain and simple. Electrons and protons are prime examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supersymmetry claims that each particle has a superpartner. Each force particle therefore has a superpartner that is a matter particle and each matter particle has a superpartner that’s a force carrier. An electron then would have a superpartner called a Selectron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know. This is one of the problems I have with supersymmetry, the naming convention stinks. “Selectrons”… give me a break. The other problem is that in a stroke, this hypothesis essentially doubles the amount of all known particles (aren’t theories supposed to make thing simpler?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that no evidence exists yet to clearly indicate these superpartners. If true though, it could lead to unifying the fundamental forces of nature, (something I’ve been waiting a long time for) and figuring out what the hell dark matter is. That would be nice. I could learn to like it if it does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if these hidden photons exist, they apparently have two important attributes:&lt;br&gt;
The first is that it would have to have a tiny mass.&lt;br&gt;
The second is that they’d have to be essentially invisible because they would not interact with the charged particles in ordinary matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means they could go through the densest material like it was nothing. In this way they are like ghostly neutrinos that stars create which are uncharged very very light particles that can zip thru light years of lead like it was a vacuum. That is the reason why neutrinos are the first particles detected if you catch a supernova early enough. They have no problem zipping away the moment they’re created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking how we detect these buggers (let alone send an email) if they’re invisible?&lt;br&gt;
It is believed that they can oscillate between normal photon and hidden photon. This is yet another striking similarity with neutrinos. They too can change from one flavor of neutrino to another (this is what resolved “The Solar Neutrino Problem” a while back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then conceivably do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-    encode information into a laser beam&lt;br&gt;
2-    shine said laser beam at the ground&lt;br&gt;
3-   some photons will oscillate into hidden photons, and sail thru the 8,000 mile diameter of the earth&lt;br&gt;
4-    some of these would exit the ground in China say and oscillate back into photons&lt;br&gt;
5-    Instruments can then read the encoded message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicist Doug Shaw at Queen Mary, University of London, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227054.800-hidden-photons-to-send-secret-emails-through-earth.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that it would be a challenge technically to line up transmitters and receivers precisely over large distances, but he agrees that the idea is feasible in principle. “It’s a nice idea,” he says. “Unlike most hypothetical particles that are only accessible at high energies, these particles, if they exist, would have potentially useful real-world applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eavesdropping on such communications would be impossible unless they were in the line of sight of the beam. I’m sure that cybersecurity people will love this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submarines could communicate much more safely and stealthily using hidden photons instead of acoustics which tend to spread-out everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could even communicate directly to places where radio cannot like the other side of the moon or maybe into the heads of people wearing those tinfoil helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing just occurred to me. Photons travel at the speed of light because they’re massless. If they oscillate into hidden photons that have any mass at all, then they could no longer travel that fast. So this requires a particle that transitions between the speed of light and sub-light speed over and over. I wonder if this presents any problems for the equations? Is there any precedent for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major downside with hidden-photon signaling is bandwidth. Malcolm Fairbairn, a physicist at King’s College London, has said that the signal capacity of a message going through the full diameter of the earth would be just 1 bit per second: “At that speed it would take about a year to download an mp3 file”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we may have hidden-photon email in the future but the emails would probably be very short and…sorry…no attachments allowed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241183518563"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_emperor_of_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c17b45f7d986bd7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Your Friday Dose of Woo: The Emperor of the Woo-niverse</title><published>2009-05-01T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/IAbzASERaHE/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_emperor_of_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_emperor_of_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started this little vanity bit known as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;, lo, these nearly three years ago, when I introduced the waiting blogosphere to the woo-tastic quantum homeopathic stylings of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_no.php"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;,  I've occasionally wondered if I had started out with too much woo. I mean, Milgrom is a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard act to follow, so densely does he blend together the most amazing hard core homeopathic woo combined with quantum pseudoscientific posturings that put Deepak Chopra to shame, all tied together with the most awesomely dense, yet ultimately meaningless, equations that look like something they put on that blackboard in &lt;em&gt;The Day The Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt; (the original, not the lame Keanu Reeves remake), only less comprehensible. I was concerned that I had, if you'll excuse the vulgarity, shot my wad, metaphorically speaking, leaving nothing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I needn't have worried. Many were the candidates for Your Friday Dose of Woo that gave Milgrom a run for his quantum homeopathic money. (Homeopathic money? does that mean someone took a tiny shaving of money and serially succussed it to a 30C dilution?) And, even now, although it's admittedly less common than it once was, I still occasionally find a bit of woo that truly knocks my socks off, a woo that brings back that first rush of realization of the joy of woo that I felt the first time I laid eyes upon one of Milgrom's quantum homeopathic equations and "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/your_friday_dose_of_woo_when_a_mad_mathe.php"&gt;quantum coupling&lt;/a&gt;" between homeopathic practitioner, patient, and remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one such bit of woo. Meet &lt;a href="http://www.pyradyne.com/fred.shtml"&gt;Dr. Fred Bell&lt;/a&gt;. I even feel a bit of a connection with Dr. Bell, too. Not only was he born in southeast Michigan, but he went to the University of Michigan, my alma mater. Let's &lt;a href="http://www.pyradyne.com/fred.shtml"&gt;meet him&lt;/a&gt; briefly before we launch into his most delightfully woo-ful site:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_emperor_of_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_emperor_of_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/IAbzASERaHE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241182304505"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/05/gnome-nautilus-open-terminal/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e7fc060a9c8b2a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">!gnome nautilus-open-terminal …</title><published>2009-05-01T12:27:51Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T12:27:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/05/gnome-nautilus-open-terminal/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;!gnome nautilus-open-terminal is a good start, but I want to add other stuff to my desktop menu&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241176536811"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1391">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0aeb4efa1611c018</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Matrix verbs as "ghostly adverbials"?</title><published>2009-05-01T11:15:56Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T11:15:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1391" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, fev at Headsup: The Blog featured an unusual referential tangle ("&lt;a href="http://headsuptheblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/march-of-pronouns.html"&gt;March of the pronouns&lt;/a&gt;", 4/24/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A 30-year-old Pontiac man is in the Oakland County Jail and facing felony charges after authorities said he rammed a man’s car after finding his wife in the backseat with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the amusing combinatorics of reference (two possible antecedents each for &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, plus the question of whose backseat it was), fev notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Authorities said" isn't &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; part of the subordinate clause. It&amp;#39;s acting like the British &amp;quot;claim quotes&amp;quot; — sort of a ghostly sentence adverb, reminding us that there&amp;#39;s some sort of privileged source to which (or whom) the otherwise potentially libelous assertion can be pinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular example, it's possible that the authorities issued a statement before the guy went to jail, and it's likely that "facing felony charges" involves something that could be construed as an authoritative statement early in the process. But in general, I think that fev is right: there are matrix sentence frames that indicate how you know something, or how you feel about it, while being otherwise transparent to the semantic relationships expressed by the structures around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of a search of newspaper archives, here are a couple of examples of "authorities said" in after-clauses where it's almost certain that the authorities told the story long after the events whose chronological order is being explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A man was tased at SeaWorld on Tuesday afternoon after authorities said he failed to pay admission and fought with security personnel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Three children were drowned tonight in the Scudog River after authorities said their mother, identified as a Mrs. Wallace, tossed them into the swirling waters and then leaped in after them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these examples might also be analyzed as parentheticals without the punctuation, since there is no &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;quot;A man was tased at SeaWorld … after (authorities said) he failed to pay admission …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's somewhat suspicious, or at least disappointing, that a search of the  Proquest Historical Newspaper archives turns up no instances of the string "after authorities said that", although there are 58 instances of "after authorities said".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to find examples where a matrix sentence frame is used as if it were a modal or epistemological adverbial of some sort. But some of these are cases where the matrix might actually be a parenthetical (as in the case of the "authorities said" examples above), and some of them are cases where logic can be restored by treating a subordinate clause as within the scope of the matrix verb, as if by shifting the order of clauses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Unless it's shipped soon, I'm afraid that I'll have to cancel my order. (= I'm afraid that [I'll have to cancel my order unless it's shipped soon].)&lt;br&gt;
If there's a swine flu pandemic, she says that hundreds of millions will die. (= She says that [hundreds of millions will die if there's a swine flu pandemic].)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone find a genuine example where neither of these dodges will work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a sentence of the form "X after police said that Y", where it's clear that X and Y both took place long before police said anything about the matter. Or it might be "X, because I'm afraid that Y", where the relationship between X and Y is entirely independent of my emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241176504369"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/new_blog_for_environmentalists.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9af91d010943170</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weblogs"/><title type="html">New blog for environmentalists</title><published>2009-05-01T11:42:57Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T11:42:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/5MYN8BRVLVU/new_blog_for_environmentalists.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/new_blog_for_environmentalists.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out Chris Clarke's latest effort, &lt;a href="http://theclade.faultline.org/"&gt;The Clade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/new_blog_for_environmentalists.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5MYN8BRVLVU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241176504368"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/dilute_this_poll.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7deb558cc25a415d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Dilute this poll</title><published>2009-05-01T11:33:38Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T11:33:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/NaGumKxKqrM/dilute_this_poll.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/dilute_this_poll.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;WHY DO PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN THIS HOMEOPATHY &lt;b&gt;CRAP&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

As per usual interesting world events always seem to happen when I’m traveling overseas, although in this case it was only Tasmania so I wasn’t too much out of touch with what was happening. However the media I had access to wasn’t initially the CDC website, WHO website or anywhere truly useful but the bog standard and crappy normal media with their teams of incompetent buffoons. However it would appear I was not the only one and even those who should know better, such a national health ministers,  seem unable to know how to find out useful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial surprise of how long Mexico sat on their hands before realising they had a serious problem was soon followed by reports of countries banning pork. After Indonesia’s debacle at handling the H5N1 problem and their ongoing deaths I would have thought that Mexico noticed this  and also China’s canning over it’s slow response to ask for help. But apparently not. Reports trickling out of the backwaters of Mexico suggest that this virus has been on the go since early March, which is fantastic as it has been widely accepted that contagious diseases need to have containment and controls lines set up within 21 days. It is simply amazing that a country such as Mexico, which I thought was reasonably advanced, could have botched this so badly.  Hopefully they will learn from this as their economy takes a thumping as it closes down for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we find that various countries around the world are banning imports of pork products. Like, WTF? I realise that in nearly all of these countries the level of science education is quite low but it really isn’t rocket science to know that influenza is transmitted by contact and people coughing. It is not the sort of disease transmitted by eating the creatures infected. And what’s more, last time I checked most people cook pork and don’t eat raw pig lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for some good news, CNN has actually had some decent reporting. Pointing out the usual weekly death rate from flu in the USA is still more than the all the deaths of this H1N1 strain is a step in the right direction. Furthermore pointing out the world isn’t going to end in a Zombie controlled mess and the current lethality is only 8% is also a good step in countering the usual hype from the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we get the dumness again. Here in Australia we have the thermal scanning at airports. Even after the experts point out it will not work because people carrying the virus don’t develop symptoms for 7 days we get stupid claims about “protecting Australia”. Pigs arse you are going to protect Australia this way. It has been pointed out before there really is no way to prevent the spread of these types of diseases. Sure, you can slow them down so your health services are not swamped but the conception of detecting something with such a long latency is simply a joke. The money would be better spent on direct health care where and when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we get onto some of the local comments. We have the various  health ministers  and experts commenting on how well prepared we are to handle  this. As someone who has had a child with Influenza A in hospital in Adelaide ,I’ll call bullshit on that one. The concept of isolation was not used until my sick son had been sitting amongst non flu hospital patients for about 4 hours. And this was in the middle of the flu A outbreak when the hospitals ran out of ward space. This was the same year the hospital  morgue ran out of room and the refrigerated shipping containers were used for overflow. Now I’m not saying that this isn’t coping but it isn’t coping in the way your average voting citizen expects. Why can’t they be upfront about what will happen if this is a pandemic? Be open with the fact that hospitals won’t have room, it’s simply too expensive to have that much spare capacity. Be open with the fact your morgue will overflow and you’ll be using shipping containers. Even if we had a measly 1% of very sick people there is no way in a pink fit 10,000 people turning up to hospitals in Adelaide is going to work. And if we had 10% sick and 1% fatalities just be open and realistic that the standard of health care is simply not going to be very good. Doctors and nurses don’t grow on trees. Neither do administration staff or people who drive medical supply trucks or ambulances. We live in such a safe society we simply can’t deal with small disasters and our expectations of health care and government support are incredibly high due to lack of major threats for many generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, ignore the wild hype, we don’t need to get excited and run around like headless chooks. Yep, it may be really bad however it most likely won’t be as bad as what your grandparents survived in 1918 and the resources we do have these days are so much better. You really don’t need to get too exited, you were listening to the repeated warnings scientists have been saying for decades about this sort of scenario? You did support increased science funding by lobbying politicians didn’t you? Because without that lobbying we wouldn’t have the H1N1 vaccine already…oh wait…you listened to the hype and not the scientists? Maybe if a few more media stations did what CNN has now done and have some decent science reporting this current mess would not have got out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to everyone who commented on the post about saying &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/disabilities_vs_special_needs"&gt;disabilities or special needs&lt;/a&gt;. My own preference is "disabilities," which doesn't have to be a negative or pejorative term, as it might be thought. "Disabilities" (to us) simply states "what is" regarding Charlie, who's got some true challenges related to his neurology, as well as some remarkable abilities, many of which, it's felt by many, remain yet untapped. He's very much "differently abled."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to Charlie's teacher yesterday, we paused over his reading programs and also efforts to teach him to read a calendar. These are all things that we've been working on teaching Charlie for years. Countless methods to teach Charlie to read have been tried, countless books have been read to him, Jim and I have stood him time and again in front of signs at train stations and storefronts and had him identify the letters. It's only been for the past few years that Charlie has been able to identify (most of the) the alphabet correctly. He still presses "P" on the computer when we say "B" and "V" for "Y." He's getting down how to tell time (with a digital clock) but the calendar---with its many words for months and days---has eluded Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that he doesn't have a sense of time (Charlie's internal clock is set to the five-days-at-school, two-days-weekend sequence). And Charlie's an avid reader of all stimuli not involving words, especially when color and shape are notable.  He still does best with photos; as shown at his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;hearing test&lt;/a&gt; last week, he's getting a lot better at recognizing objects in line drawings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to words. Charlie is definitely (likes his two parents) a talker. I do say that he is "minimally verbal" as he uses a limited number of words at a time, and tends to speak in 2-4 word phrases. He definitely talks a lot (some of it's not 100% distinct); he does prefer to use his voice to express himself. (He's used to people around him doing that---like I said, he has two parents who are big talkers). (And fast talkers too.) Further, for Charlie, one word often means a lot more than it's generally used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's teacher noted to me that he's definitely learned to greet people with "hi" but just casually saying "bye" to announce that he is departing, is something he has yet to learn to do. In the course of discussing this, she and I both realized that, when Charlie says "bye," it never has a "casual" meaning like "see ya later" or "ciao" or "&lt;a href="http://www.explorecrete.com/various/greek-language.htm"&gt;yassou&lt;/a&gt;." Charlie usally says "bye" when he wants us to, well, go away as he's had enough and we, pesky parents/teachers that we are, are overdoing it.  In other words, "bye" has powerful connotations for Charlie: It's not a word he uses lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of how Charlie uses &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/yes-no-brown-noodles/"&gt;yes and no&lt;/a&gt;, and the absence (so far) of a word for gray areas and in-between feelings and states of being like "maybe" in his repertoire. Charlie often uses "yes" not only as "yes" but as a shorthand for "I want" or "that, please." "No" is definitely "no," but it's also more like "no not yet" or "not right now" or "I'm not sure I need to think about it more, let some time pass." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bye, yes, no.&lt;/i&gt;  Guess you could say that Charlie gets a lot of mileage out of monosyllabics---a straightforward statement about how many words (or rather how few) you really need to get your point across.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241159149345"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=468">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed5bc747332c6a7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medical Academia"/><category term="Medical Ethics"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Harvard Medical School: Veritas for Sale  (Part VI)</title><published>2009-05-01T06:00:02Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T06:00:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=468" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Loose Ends: Dr. Koh and More&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dr. Federman’s letter and my reply, posted in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=456"&gt;Part V&lt;/a&gt; of this series,† there seemed little point in pursuing the matter further. Although Dr. Federman never answered my reply, he did send, at my request, a copy of Commissioner of Public Health &lt;a href="http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/medicine-health/articles/president-obama-taps-howard-koh-assistant-secretary-health"&gt;Howard Koh&lt;/a&gt;’s written “construction of the events in the Massachusetts Special Commission.” As you may recall, those events had occurred at meetings that Dr. Koh never attended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="right"&gt;July 29, 2002&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dear Dr. Federman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I have had an opportunity to review Dr. Kimball Atwood’s characterizations of the role Dr. David Eisenberg played as an advisor and designee of the Department of Public Health (DPH) and I am writing to clarify several misrepresentations of that role. As you may know, I personally selected Dr. Eisenberg as my designee for the Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners based on his high level of scientific and clinical expertise in the field, as well as his international reputation for evidence-based research. I felt at that time, as I do now, that he was the appropriate choice to represent the Department and I am extremely grateful for his advice and his integrity during this most contentious process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;During the course of the Commission, Dr. Eisenberg brought to my attention some of the conflicts that had arisen among the members, despite his attempts to diffuse the hostility and to engage the members in collegial debate. In an effort to overcome these difficulties and deflect unwarranted criticism, Nancy Ridley, Assistant Commissioner for Health Quality Management, attended the meetings over the last six months as the DPH voting designee, with Dr. Eisenberg as an advisor. She also organized a DPH workgroup of the Commission in an attempt to bring consensus and closure to what had become a very polarized and highly personalized process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I need to state emphatically that the approval of the final Commission report is my responsibility, and is largely a product of the DPH workgroup that Assistant Commissioner Ridley chaired. Dr. Eisenberg had actually not been supportive of either the “majority” or “minority” reports that were originally presented, and neither was Ms. Ridley. She attempted to address as many of Dr. Eisenberg’s concerns as possible but knew he still had issues with the final document. She feels very strongly that there needs to be regulatory oversight of non-physician practitioners of complementary and alternative naturopathic practice. Assistant Commissioner Ridley, on behalf of the Department and with my consent, signed the report that included a significant number of revisions which narrowed the scope of practice, ensured collaborative relationships between physician and non-physician practitioners, and broadened the scope of any proposed regulatory oversight required. Dr. Eisenberg’s advice to DPH was delivered in a fair and balanced manner based his outstanding experience as a clinician and scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I believe that one of the contributing factors for the polarization within the Commission had little to do with Dr. Eisenberg’s participation rather than that of his staffperson, Michael Cohen, who attended Commission meetings in his absence. Mr. Cohen was repeatedly characterized as the alternate DPH designee, which he was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;In summary, Dr. Eisenberg’s expertise and professionalism throughout this difficult process have been greatly appreciated by the Department. DPH was truly fortunate to be represented and advised by a person of Dr. Eisenberg’s stature and character. I would be more that pleased to speak to you or Dean Martin on his behalf. Please feel free to contact me at xxx.xxx.xxxx if you need any additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Howard K. Koh, MD, MPH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The range of self-serving misrepresentations in that letter is wide, and is worrisome in someone who will be “responsible for the major health agencies, including the CDC, FDA and NIH, and [will be] the leading health advisor to the Secretary of HHS.” I have already discussed some of the facts &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=438"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=456"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and will add more now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Regarding Dr. Eisenberg’s “high level of scientific and clinical expertise in the field,” Dr. Koh can be excused for having at first assumed this to be the case, but not after being presented with mounting evidence to the contrary. After one of several meetings of the commission in which Dr. Relman and I had enumerated absurd and dangerous naturopathic practices, I asked Dr. Eisenberg why he had not spoken up in agreement with our reservations. He replied that he hadn’t previously known about such particulars. If true, this belied his implicit expertise. It was also an indictment of his &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/127/1/61"&gt;previous claim&lt;/a&gt; to having been familiar with some of the very sources from which we got our information. Now, moreover, he had been made aware of such particulars; yet still he did not speak. I sent a letter to Dr. Koh making this point and calling attention to Dr. Eisenberg’s conflicts of interest, but never received a reply. In other treatises made available to Dr. Koh, particularly the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/minority.pdf"&gt;Minority Report&lt;/a&gt;, I called attention to numerous challenges to the Public Health that would be posed by licensed NDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The assertion that Dr. Eisenberg had attempted to “diffuse the hostility and to engage the members in collegial debate” is laughable. The “hostility,” such as it was—really more a tone of exasperation coming from Relman and me—was based mainly on two, frustrating facts of the commission’s deliberations, each a result of Eisenberg’s efforts or lack thereof: first, that the commission, as a matter of formal policy, would not entertain scientific or medical critiques of naturopathic practices; second, that Dr. Eisenberg himself refused to engage in debate, collegial or otherwise, even though the naive members of the commission looked to him for expertise. Whatever “concerns” or “issues with the final document” Dr. Eisenberg might have had, he didn’t bother to voice them to the commission as a whole. Dr. Koh knew, because I wrote him, that I’d asked Dr. Eisenberg to meet privately to discuss naturopathic practices but he had declined.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Assistant Commissioner Ridley’s organization of a “DPH workgroup” had not been formally disclosed to those commission members opposed to ND licensure, although we had heard of its existence. The workgroup could not have been conceived to “bring consensus,” since it excluded dissenters, and it was probably illegal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;How fortunate was the DPH to be represented and advised by Dr. Eisenberg? The statement, “there needs to be regulatory oversight of non-physician practitioners of complementary and alternative naturopathic practice” reveals that Dr. Koh’s advisor had failed to inform him of the most important point of all: NDs tell patients that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; physicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Readers more savvy than I might recognize Dr. Koh’s scapegoating of Michael Cohen as standard procedure for political functionaries. I find it cynical and distasteful, even if I have no use for Mr. Cohen’s &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=438"&gt;views &lt;/a&gt;of modern medicine or of “CAM.” I add that Mr. Cohen &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the “alternate DPH designee” whether or not Dr. Koh might have approved. This was established not by my “repeated characterizations,” more accurately described as observations, but by Dr. Eisenberg’s having sent Mr. Cohen in his stead more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Notably missing from Dr. Koh’s letter was an acknowledgment of Dr. Eisenberg’s undisclosed funding sources and of their embarrassing relation to the commission’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Dr. Relman Speaks Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I sent Dr. Relman a copy of my last exchange with Dr. Federman. To my happy surprise, he went out of his way to support me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;October 11, 2002&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dear Dan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kim Atwood sent me a copy of your letter of September 26 to him, and his reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I do not want to become part of your dialogue with him, nor do I want to be involved in any discussions between the Dean’s office and David Eisenberg’s CAM center. This is not because I do not have opinions about CAM (you surely know I do), but because I am not sufficiently acquainted with all the relevant events and factual details in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;However, I do have first-hand knowledge about two of the issues raised in your letter, and felt compelled to tell you what I know about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;First, Howard Koh’s “construction of the events in the Massachusetts Special Commission.” I personally attended virtually all of the meetings for more than a year, before I felt impelled to resign as the Commission’s work was drawing to a close. Howard Koh attended &lt;u&gt;none&lt;/u&gt; of the meetings and must have formed whatever “construction” he put on events that transpired at those meetings from accounts by either David Eisenberg (who was often absent), or his deputy Nancy Ridley (who suddenly showed up for the last two or three meetings). I resigned to protest the grossly biased manner in which the meetings were being conducted. I personally observed David’s behavior during many meetings (when neither Koh nor Ridley were there) and became increasingly disturbed by his actions and comments, which I thought were equivocating, unscholarly, and anti-scientific. I did not at the time know of any financial conflicts of interest with the naturopaths, but if Kim’s assertion is correct that David’s activities received support from a naturopathic school, this information should certainly have been made clear to all members of the Commission—and David’s behavior at the meetings becomes even more reprehensible. At any rate, I cannot believe that if you had attended those meetings, you would be comfortable defending David against most of the charges Kim now makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Secondly, with respect to the avowed mission of Eisenberg’s CAM center. The only justification for its existence at Harvard, it seems to me, should be that it serves as an instrument for carrying out rigorous scientific studies of the effectiveness and safety of CAM modalities. I think I know something about this subject because I have carefully studied the CAM literature for a long time and have paid particular attention to what has come from David Eisenberg and his colleagues. The relatively few credible clinical trials of CAM have been negative or at best equivocal. Eisenberg’s contributions to that scientific literature are almost non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;To date there has been virtually no clinical science from the CAM center at HMS—mostly descriptions of the use and theory of CAM. Were this any other field, I cannot imagine HMS continuing to be so supportive. Why do we not hold CAM to the same standards as other areas in Medicine? What will it take for us to finally say that the Emperor has no clothes—however popular and well-funded he may be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Bud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Arnold S. Relman, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Minor Publicity &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;As far as I know, nothing much came of my efforts. An opportunity for the matter to become more widely known seemed to appear a few months later, when science writer Chris Mooney called me to say that he was interested in writing something about “CAM” at Harvard and that Stephen Barrett of &lt;a href="http://quackwatch.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;had told him, “Atwood knows where the body is buried at Harvard Medical School.” This eventually resulted in &lt;a href="http://www.reason.com/news/printer/28808.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Reason Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, but I never heard a peep about it from anyone at HMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;More “CAM” Promotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Although I grew weary of the topic, I couldn’t help but notice, over the years, more evidence of the main point that I had tried to make to Dr. Federman: that HMS promotes quackery. Some of this had occurred well before I entered the fray, but I’d been unaware of it. The 1992 &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981205194510/http://www.naturalhealthvillage.com/reports/rpt2oam/toc.htm"&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;“Alternative Medicine: Expanding Medical Horizons,” accurately &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm"&gt;described &lt;/a&gt;as “an uncritical catalog of virtually every dubious and unproven treatment method of the past 100 years,” had included Eisenberg, his deputy Ted Kaptchuk, Harvard homeopath Edward Chapman, and Harvard nutritionists Walter Willett and Lilian Cheung among its contributors. The January, 1999 &lt;a href="http://theintegratorblog.com/pdf/IndustryHealthNewsFiles.pdf"&gt;newsletter &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Integrator for the Business of Alternative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; included this entry (emphasis in the original):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eisenberg to headline NMHCC track.&lt;/strong&gt; David Eisenberg, MD, will deliver the kick-off presentation at the National Managed Health Care Congress track. INTEGRATOR publisher-editor &lt;strong&gt;John Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;, the track chair, who was originally scheduled to give the presentation explains simply: “We want to draw people into the CAM conversation and David Eisenberg has been a giant in this movement.” Weeks remains involved as a moderator throughout the seven session meeting. Funding for the change came available when San Diego-based &lt;strong&gt;American Specialty Health Plans&lt;/strong&gt; came aboard to sponsor the track. ASHP has sponsored numerous CAM events in the past two years, including the &lt;strong&gt;Casa Colina WholeHealth Forum&lt;/strong&gt;, the annual meeting by the publishers of &lt;strong&gt;Employee Benefits News&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Forum&lt;/strong&gt; meeting scheduled for Honolulu in early February. The NMHCC has also scheduled a CAM debate, which pits National Council Against Health Fraud’s &lt;strong&gt;John Renner, MD&lt;/strong&gt;, against &lt;strong&gt;James Dillard, MD&lt;/strong&gt;, medical director for &lt;strong&gt;Oxford Health Plans&lt;/strong&gt;. March 29-April 1: 888-882-2500&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-day event in San Francisco in June on integrative clinic skills training, developed by &lt;strong&gt;Cambridge Health Resources&lt;/strong&gt; (CHR) together with &lt;strong&gt;Linda Bedell Logan’s Solutions in Integrative Medicine&lt;/strong&gt; has been firmed up. However, the broader &lt;strong&gt;In Health&lt;/strong&gt; conference which CHR was paired has been canceled for lack of major sponsorship, according to &lt;strong&gt;Marcy Robinson&lt;/strong&gt;. Robinson heads up planning and sponsor relations for CHR. Robinson recently announced that the five speakers include: Bedell-Logan (sessions on practice management), &lt;strong&gt;Lynn Budlong&lt;/strong&gt;, of &lt;strong&gt;Budlong, Glassanos and Company&lt;/strong&gt; (sessions on business development — Budlong has worked in this arena for the Harvard team assembled by Eisenberg), &lt;strong&gt;Russell Greenfield, MD&lt;/strong&gt;, a resident at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (clinical integration), and author-expert on CAM legal issues, &lt;strong&gt;Michael Cohen, Esq&lt;/strong&gt;. (legal issues). &lt;strong&gt;John Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;, INTEGRATOR publisher-editor will provide an overview on the state of CAM integration early on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Several bullets were spent from that smoking gun. When I first saw it I lamented not having known of it at the time of my correspondence with Dean Federman, but I doubt it would have mattered. The hyperlinked &lt;a href="http://theintegratorblog.com/pdf/IndustryHealthNewsFiles.pdf"&gt;file &lt;/a&gt;of &lt;em&gt;Integrator&lt;/em&gt; newsletters is chock full of more damning information regarding the HMS “CAM” cabal, most of which I’ll leave to readers to discover for themselves. One passage worth mentioning is from January, 2000:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis-based MEDTRONIC FOUNDATION has awarded a $900,000 grant over three years to BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER to support infrastructure developments on a model integrative facility. DAVID EISENBERG, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, will direct the project. A January 19 release identified the leading infrastructure “components” which Eisenberg views as necessary in a conventional medical establishment as: 1) development of referral mechanisms; 2) credentialing and quality assurance; 3) “communication strategies;” 4) creating standards for a natural products formulary; 5) development of educational materials; and 6) creating secured electronic data collection methods.” Eisenberg states the goal as “to develop a model that serves as a resource for other Harvard affiliated teaching hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dean Federman must have known about that grant well before I approached him. I guess I could have saved myself a lot of effort and frustration if I’d known about it, too. Clearly, there was never to be a real reckoning of the charges that I made. Sometimes I wonder why he gave me as much of a hearing as he did. Perhaps he worried that I knew things that would embarrass HMS. I thought I did, but what I knew apparently wasn’t embarrassing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Not long after the first quoted passage from &lt;em&gt;The Integrator&lt;/em&gt; was written, &lt;a href="http://www.ncahf.org/about/renner.html"&gt;Dr. Renner&lt;/a&gt; died and Dr. Eisenberg joined with Andrew Weil protegé Russell Greenfield to pull the wool over the eyes of the Federation of State Medical Boards, making it suddenly easier for quacks to peddle snake oil—an event that I’ve discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=62"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=235"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;on SBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Is it “Quackery” only if it’s Deceptive?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;At about the same time that I was corresponding with Dr. Federman, Dr. &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/25/2641"&gt;Carl Bartecchi&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado School of Medicine sent a letter to HMS wondering about financial conflicts of interest and other aspects of the HMS “CAM” program. At some point Dr. Bartecchi and I discovered each other and he sent me Harvard’s reply, which had also involved Drs. Federman and Eisenberg. There was an interesting passage in Dr. Eisenberg’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Bartecchi says in his letter, “I long for the day when they label something ‘quackery’.” It should be mentioned that I served as a consultant to the Federation of Sate Medical Boards ‘Model &lt;a href="http://www.fsmb.org/pdf/2002_grpol_Complementary_Alternative_Therapies.pdf"&gt;Guidelines &lt;/a&gt;for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice.’ This document describes a series of suggestions, derived through consensus, as to the judicious use or avoidance of complementary and alternative medicine. These guidelines avoid the label ‘quackery’ which explicitly implies deception. I share with Dr. Bartecchi a disdain for any practice which intentionally deceives and manipulates a patient in any circumstance. Moreover, in the annual Harvard Medical School course on complementary and alternative medicine I typically deliver a didactic presentation entitled ‘Advising patients who seek complementary and alternative medicine.’ In this lecture I include a summary of the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11242572?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;by Beyerstein from the Academic Medicine 2001 series on CAM which provides sensible advice in terms of avoiding complementary and alternative medicine practitioners who meet certain criteria consistent with definitions of ‘quackery.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Wow. I can’t explain how something might “explicitly imply,” but to claim that the practitioner’s intent, which will frequently be unknowable, is a necessary basis for identifying quackery can only be a sign of naïveté or of, well, deception. It is also contrary to other, more influential uses of the term, as I and others have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=235#comment-10074"&gt;previously explained&lt;/a&gt;. Is it not obvious that peddling Laetrile or “colon cleansing” is quackery, regardless of whether or not the peddler believes in those methods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Eisenberg’s citation of Barry Beyerstein is laughable. I knew Barry quite well and had many discussions with him about the sad state of affairs on campuses, including that of HMS. He sparred quite heatedly, right on the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12228075?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus"&gt;pages &lt;/a&gt;of &lt;em&gt;Academic Medicine,&lt;/em&gt; with Eisenberg’s cronies Andrew Weil and John Astin. Here is some of the “Sensible Advice” that Dr. Eisenberg reported having borrowed from Dr. Beyerstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Avoid CAM Practitioners who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;1) Are hostile to conventional medicine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;2) Cannot supply a reasonable rationale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;3) Claim to possess secret ingredients or processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;4) Appeal to “other ways of knowing” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Nothing to disagree with there, of course, but Eisenberg himself has violated those tenets repeatedly, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020222174952/http:/www.bidmc.harvard.edu/medicine/camr/Patients.html"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 1in 0pt 0.5in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please consult your local telephone yellow pages under these categories:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Acupuncture&lt;br&gt;
Chiropractic&lt;br&gt;
Holistic Practitioners&lt;br&gt;
Massage - Therapeutic&lt;br&gt;
Naturopathic Physicians&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;The Elusive Degree of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=310"&gt;Dr. So and So&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Beyerstein had also warned against practitioners who “claim degrees from unaccredited institutions,” and Eisenberg included that caveat in his response to Dr. Bartecchi. At around the same time the late Bob Imrie observed that it was curious, in this era of the World Wide Web, that if you &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Macau+Institute+of+Chinese+Medicine%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2007-32,GGLJ:en&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;sa=N"&gt;Google &lt;/a&gt;the “Macao Institute of Chinese Medicine” you get, well, &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;—other than it being named as the alma mater of two American “CAM” enthusiasts. One of them is Ted Kaptchuk, ‘OMD,’ who has long been Dr. Eisenberg’s second in command of “CAM” at HMS. When I first heard this I didn’t think much about it. My reply to Imrie was something like, “what difference does it make? It’s bogus whether it’s bogus or not, because the entire field is bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Shortly thereafter I realized that there is an obvious, additional ethical problem with portraying oneself as having earned a degree from an institution that most people would assume had been endorsed by some appropriate body, if such is not the case. At the time I was the chairman of the Committee for the Quality of Medical Practice at the Massachusetts Medical Society, and using that title I wrote to the Macao government asking about the Macao Institute of Chinese (or “Traditional Chinese”) Medicine. Here was the reply (emphasis in the original):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 07, 2003 12:41 AM&lt;br&gt;
Subject: Reply to the inquiry about ” Macao Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Chairman Kimball C. Atwood,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for your e-mail dated 18th Sept (we received it from Government Information Bureau on 6th Oct.). In reply to your inquiry, we would like to inform you that ¡§Macao Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine¡¨ &lt;strong&gt;HAS NOT BEEN&lt;/strong&gt; one of the higher education institutions in Macao, and the concerned Institute hence &lt;strong&gt;HAS NOT BEEN&lt;/strong&gt; a degree-conferring academic institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is anything additional you would like to know, please feel free to contact us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macao SAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I realize that this does not settle the matter. It is quite possible that in the 30+ years since Kaptchuk reports having attended the Institute, governmental memory has faded or has become selective. That is all the more possible because Macao, like Hong Kong, was ‘handed over’ from its colonial ruler (Portugal, in Macao’s case) to China on the eve of the 21st century. Nevertheless, there are more reasons to think otherwise. One of my correspondents had traveled to Macau prior to the hand-over and was unable to find any record of the MICM in various libraries and pertinent governmental offices. The Web continues to lack any corroborating evidence of such an institute, although there ought to have been many students there from all over the world: according to the two Americans, the school was a magnet for ‘overseas Chinese.’ Other attempts by Dr. Bartecchi and me to get information—from HMS (see below), from the Massachusetts and California Acupuncture Boards, and from Dan Bensky, the other American who reports having received a degree from the MICM—have been frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Bensky’s online &lt;a href="http://www.ilcah.org/html/keyMembers//2009/03/16/20090316145415.html"&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;, however, raises more disturbing questions. He calls his degree from Macao a “Diploma in Chinese Medicine,” suggesting that the ‘D’ in ‘OMD’ stands for ‘Diploma’, not for ‘Doctor’—as Kaptchuk has &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Jx5Zw3i5CZ4C&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#PPT1,M1"&gt;represented &lt;/a&gt;it (Bensky can call himself ‘doctor’ in any case, because he subsequently completed the osteopathy program at Michigan State University). Bensky reports having attended MICM with Kaptchuk, and that it took two years to complete. Bensky did not have a bachelor’s degree when he began at Macau. Currently, a doctoral candidate at the &lt;a href="http://www.cdutcm.org/Html/Admission/17052692.html"&gt;Chengdu University&lt;/a&gt; of Traditional Chinese Medicine must be a college graduate, and the course of study requires three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Bensky also reports that at Macao there were “three main teachers…although in the end, one of the teachers refused to allow Westerners to participate in her clinic.” And: “after graduation…as I was identified with the school, no one else in Macau would work with me.” This hardly suggests an ‘Institute’ or a course of study with externally recognized standards. According to &lt;a href="http://www.paradigm-pubs.com/blog/termchaos"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of years ago at the nomenclature conference of the A.A.O.M. (either ‘American Association of Oriental Medicine’ or ‘Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine’—I’m not sure which)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Benksy dismissed the long-term expert consensus described in Marnae Ergil’s excellent paper on translation principles as simply “wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;An interested observer, suggesting that Bensky’s credentials might be relevant to evaluating that opinion, responded with &lt;a href="http://www.paradigm-pubs.com/blog/termchaos#comment-21"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Dan Bensky and Ted Kaptchuk hold degrees from The Macau Institute of Chinese Medicine. According to Dan in that very discussion on CHA to which Bob makes reference, the school came into existence shortly before he and Ted arrived in 1973 and went out of existence shortly after they left in 1975 with their degrees. Or were they diplomas? Or were they doctorates? What is written on those pieces of paper? This was the question I posed in the post that preceded my being banned from CHA. The notion of being “qualified by expertise and training to establish such standards” (of academic freedom) suggests that training standards themselves are of nontrivial importance in the whole matter of academic freedom. Of course they are. And of course it matters whether the word “diploma” or the word “doctorate” is written on the pieces of paper that Dan and Ted took home with them when their respective sojourns in Macau had come to an end. What does the “D” stand for in the “OMD” that appears after the names Bensky and Kaptchuk? Socrates said that to use words wrongly is not only a fault itself, it also corrupts the soul. Certainly it corrupts the use of words to use highly meaningful terms (including their abbreviations) like “diploma” and “doctorate” interchangeably. If one is qualified by expertise and training to establish standards of academic freedom, then we had better at least know with as much certainty as possible what the basis of one’s qualifications actually is…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are Bensky and Kaptchuk the MICM’s only graduates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003 I queried some of the faculty at HMS who were affiliated with Eisenberg and Kaptchuk. I sent them the message from the Macao Higher Education Bureau. They agreed that it would be ‘disturbing’ if Kaptchuk’s degree were anything but legitimate. After all, he had parlayed it into his entire academic career, including not only his appointment at HMS (where he now appears to be an Associate Professor), but numerous articles in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, and other journals. He used it to become a licensed health care practitioner in Massachusetts and probably elsewhere. He also used it to gain public roles that some would consider prestigious, such as his long membership on the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/about/naccam/roster.htm"&gt;NCCAM Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt;. He has been referred to as “Doctor” in all of those contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;About two weeks after I sent the inquiry to HMS, I got this reply from my old fellow intern, Russell Phillips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kim-I researched Ted’s background and am convinced that the credentials he lists on his CV, including his doctorate, are correct. When this came up previously he put together a packet of his diplomas etc that confirm his degree. Additionally, several state licensing boards have given him a license to practice acupuncture after researching his background. The Dean’s office (Dan Federman) has also looked into this and is convinced his credentials are correct. Please let me know if you want to discuss further. Russ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I believe that this reply merely begged the question. The several state licensing boards almost certainly did not research his background, which would have been an impossible task for them. I don’t think that HMS or any of the individuals who looked at the ‘credentials’ had either the will or the competence to investigate them thoroughly and skeptically. It is intriguing that in the past few years Kaptchuk’s ‘OMD’ has disappeared from certain contexts, including at HMS: compare &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041205165059/www.osher.hms.harvard.edu/pe_faculty.asp"&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.osher.hms.harvard.edu/people.asp"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;I reiterate that I don’t know the answer to this question. There is enough doubt about Kaptchuk’s ‘OMD’ degree, however, to put the onus on him, on HMS, and on the other interested entities to produce the evidence. It should then be evaluated by a disinterested, competent investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Harvard’s Contribution to Unethical Human Studies of Implausible Claims&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;During the time that I was gathering information for Dr. Federman, I discovered a report of an uncontrolled &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10783013?ordinalpos=23&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;trial &lt;/a&gt;of homeopathic remedies for small children diagnosed with acute otitis media. The trial was a dangerous exploitation of vulnerable subjects for no useful purpose; I have previously mentioned it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=55"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=444"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Three of the authors were Dr. Eisenberg, Ted Kaptchuk, and Harvard homeopath Edward Chapman, who would &lt;a href="http://www.massmedboard.org/public/pdf/press_releases/rel071703.pdf"&gt;soon&lt;/a&gt; lose his medical license for diddling patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;On SBM I’ve discussed other examples of unethical human trials of “CAM” claims, including NaEDTA ‘chelation therapy’ and the ‘Gonzalez Regimen’ for cancer of the pancreas. As explained &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=356"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, representatives of the HMS “CAM” project—Eisenberg and Kaptchuk—were guilty of helping to launch at least one of those trials and of misrepresenting both of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine &lt;/em&gt;‘CAM’ Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2001, the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; launched a &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/135/3/208.pdf"&gt;‘CAM’ series&lt;/a&gt;, with Eisenberg and Kaptchuk named guest editors. Although it promised “discourse about the effectiveness and safety of commonly used CAM therapies…, critical reviews of the literature…, thought pieces addressing the broader social aspects of CAM therapy…, and the rules of scientific evidence,” most of the articles were puff pieces. They also failed to disclose funding sources, in some cases, or to explain the meaning of funding sources in others. In early 2003 I wrote two letters to new editor-in-chief Harold Sox&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;one short enough for publication, the other detailed—explaining these points. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language and Fact Distortions in the Annals “CAM” Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, Dr. Eisenberg and some others in the academic “CAM” movement have been promoting old-fashioned quackery under the guise of “CAM.” In so doing they have been careful to avoid informing the Annals readership of the abundance of absurd and dangerous practices offered by the “CAM providers” that they endorse. Instead they appear to &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/137/12/965.pdf"&gt;excuse &lt;/a&gt;such practices as “reflect[ing] larger cultural and political collisions concerning evolving definitions of mainstream medical care” and “fundamental philosophic questions as to who determines which providers and therapies will be accepted as safe, effective, appropriate, or reimbursable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in a word, nonsense. Does the question of whether a damp compress can abort an evolving stroke depend on “who determines which therapies are effective?” Is the inability of the skin to absorb substantial oxygen a matter of “political collisions?” Chiropractors posing as “primary care providers” are a threat to public health, not a “conundrum.” Homeopaths making therapeutic claims, chiropractors treating infants or recommending spinal “adjustments” for health maintenance, acupuncturists performing “pulse and tongue diagnoses,” massage therapists claiming to contribute to cures by removing “toxins,” and M.D.s prescribing EDTA “chelation therapy” for coronary artery disease are all common examples of health fraud, but readers would have to look outside of the Annals series for competent discussions of such issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;…………………..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undisclosed Sources of Bias in the Annals Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eisenberg’s funding sources are conflicts of interest for his Annals articles, disclaimers notwithstanding. Did he report, to the Annals, the conflicts discussed above? According to the instructions, “when authors submit a manuscript, they must disclose all financial relationships that might bias their work.” Moreover, as you have affirmed, “editors should publish this information if they believe it will be important to readers in judging the manuscript.” That means that merely reporting the funding for the paper in question is not enough. Yet, in the &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/137/12/965.pdf"&gt;“credentialing” article&lt;/a&gt;, there is no mention of the Fetzer Institute, the Osher Foundation, the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, the New York Chiropractic College, the New England School of Acupuncture, or the Cambridge Muscular Therapy Institute, each of which has provided funds for Dr. Eisenberg’s activities in the recent past, and all of which favor the veneer of legitimacy that “credentialing” offers to “CAM providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Nor, when considering conflicts of interest, is disclosure by name alone adequate. The “credentialing” article was funded by the NCCAM, whose CAM advocacy is documented above, but whose identity was veiled by the “NIH” designation; by American Specialty Health, an organization representing chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and massage therapists, and also the single biggest contributor to both the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the licensing effort for “NDs” in California; and by Medtronics, a company whose founder is also committed to the promotion of implausible methods in the absence of validation. These ideologically biased donors may not have “had editorial input into the paper,” but will they donate in the future if they are displeased by the content of the work that they helped spawn? That is the broader truth of all such arrangements, and always has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Sox never replied, and the &lt;em&gt;Annals&lt;/em&gt; did not print the short version of my letter. I guess their expectations of authors and editors are flexible. It’s funny: I’ve since met Dr. Sox more than once in other contexts, and have found him to be a thoughtful and decent man. I haven’t talked to him specifically about that regrettable episode in the journal’s history. There’s a lot that I don’t understand, when I think of Drs. Federman, Sox, and others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;HMS Alumni: Scientists, Shruggies and Pascal’s Wager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2004 I gave a talk about naturopathy to the Symposium of the 25th reunion of the HMS class of 1979—my class. Dean Federman didn’t come, which irked me a bit but didn’t surprise me. Later I ran into him and he apologized for not having been there. FWIW. There were a few standard reactions to my talk. A couple of classmates who had become biomedical scientists and a couple of clinicians congratulated me for taking a stand against encroaching pseudomedicine. Two or three others had recently been diagnosed with scary diseases and were dabbling with fanciful methods; they wondered why I did what I did. An alumna of some note (not a member of my class) observed that “CAM” advocates could teach us something about prevention. I tried to deliver her of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;that notion&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the audience seemed to just, well, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shrug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Finally:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The proof is in &lt;a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/oshercenter/pdf/globe121607.pdf"&gt;the pudding&lt;/a&gt;. Et tu, Daniel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;In spite of it all, there is a glimmer of hope. Everything changes, even HMS. A couple of my old friends have recently become relatively big makhers there. It’s unlikely, of course,…(especially without any moolah)…but who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/miss-california-graduates-from-dumb-to-dumber-at-liberty-u/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/AKESYn8KgYI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly funny is that her story lacks internal consistency from sentence to sentence. She says she suspects it was all a setup to get her (probably from that darned “gotcha media.” You betcha!) and then explains how Perez Hilton was randomly selected from having his name chosen from a hat and that he didn’t even know who his question was going to be directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then at the end comes that great line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all about tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes Miss Prejean, it is about tolerance. But not just tolerance for bigots like yourself but also tolerance for those who aren’t you and who might wish to share the same rights and privileges you take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I’m sure Mr. Stein knows, the wise Ferris Bueller once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s understanding that makes it possible for people like us to &lt;em&gt;tolerate&lt;/em&gt; a person like yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guess if it weren’t for people like her who fought for Prop. 8, Maine wouldn’t be &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/usTopNews/idUKTRE53T8PK20090430"&gt;about to become the fifth state in the union to allow full same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. So keep up the great work. Maybe try on some white robes and hoods. Just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;

The research findings were based on a survey of 742 American adults, which to be fair isn’t a huge amount but a moderate number of subjects. And of those 742 people. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of people who attend services at least once a week — 54 percent — said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is “often” or “sometimes” justified. Only 42 percent of people who “seldom or never” go to services agreed, according to the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp;amp; Public Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified — more than six in 10 supported it. People unaffiliated with any religious organization were least likely to back it. Only four in 10 of them did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, obviously there’s nothing conclusive here but I do get a slight bit of satisfaction over the finding that those least religious were less likely to support torture than those who belong to the cult of death known as Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s not the science the ICR seems to be interested in but the scientists themselves, particularly their creationist beliefs. Take this excerpt from the George Washington Carver page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Washington Carver was one of the great scientists who honored God as the Creator. Carver revolutionized agricultural science, and his studies of nature convinced him of the existence and benevolence of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carver’s actual achievements are totally irrelevant to the ICR. All they care about is that they get to exploit his good name and the fact that he happened to have been a creationist (because he lived before Darwin) in order to make the standard creationist argument from authority. In other words, they get to say, see evolutionists, even brilliant scientists accepted creationism. Of course, this is no more a valid argument than justifying slavery by pointing out that many of the great Founding Fathers of the U.S.  owned slaves or justifying a heliocentric view of the universe because Archimedes might have held that view in his time. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So what? That’s not a valid evidential argument for why we should still believe what people in less scientifically advanced times who happened to be brilliant in their own time believed.  Then of course there’s still &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/taking-action/project-steve"&gt;Project Steve&lt;/a&gt;, the NCSE’s genius response to creationist arguments from authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the kind of argument they find convincing, they should know that Carver also didn’t believe in computers, the internet, television sets, vaccines, antibiotics, or automobiles either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, tomorrow Friday May 1st, 2009 I will be on Skeptically Speaking, a radio show here in Edmonton AB at 6PM MST. I will be on during a segment called “Speaking Up”. And boy, do I have a lot to say about this. (Do I really have to have a time limit on this, Desiree?) Plus, after my segment, Desiree and Sean (the two awesome hosts of said show) will be interviewing Dr. Ming Hsu, discussing how your brain reacts when it has to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss out!&lt;/p&gt;

I think this whole approach is important, but I certainly don't consider it "evolution-proof" and I wish the authors didn't insist on suggesting otherwise.  Here's the thing, folks: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Plasmodium &lt;/span&gt;would be under selection if you mess around with their vectors.  They can evolve, also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Koella, J.C., Lynch, P.A. , Thomas, M.B., Read, A.F.  (2009).  &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122364808/abstract"&gt;Towards evolution-proof malaria control with insecticides&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Evolutionary Applications&lt;/span&gt;, in press.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As many strategies to control malaria use insecticides against adult mosquitoes, control is undermined by the continual evolution of resistant mosquitoes. Here we suggest that using alternative insecticides, or conventional insecticides in alternative ways might enable effective control, but delay considerably or prevent the evolution of resistance. Our reasoning relies on an epidemiological and an evolutionary principle: (i) the epidemiology of malaria is strongly influenced by the life-span of mosquitoes, as most infected mosquitoes die before the malaria parasite has completed its development; and (ii) evolutionary pressure is strongest in young individuals, for selection on individuals that have completed most of their reproduction has little evolutionary effect. It follows from these principles, first, that insecticides that kill mosquitoes several days after exposure can delay considerably the evolution of resistance and, second, that the evolution of resistance against larvicides can actually benefit control, if it is associated with shorter life-span or reduced biting in adults. If a late-acting insecticide and a larvicide are combined, the evolution of resistance against larvicides can in some circumstances prevent the evolution of resistance against the more effective, late-acting insecticide, leading to sustainable, effective control. We discuss several potential options to create such insecticides, focussing on biopesticides.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Read, A.F., Lynch, P.A., Thomas, M.B. 2009.  &lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000058&amp;amp;ct=1"&gt;How to make evolution-proof insecticides for malaria control&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/span&gt; 7: e1000058.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insecticides are one of the cheapest, most effective, and best proven methods of controlling malaria, but mosquitoes can rapidly evolve resistance. Such evolution, first seen in the 1950s in areas of widespread DDT use, is a major challenge because attempts to comprehensively control and even eliminate malaria rely heavily on indoor house spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets. Current strategies for dealing with resistance evolution are expensive and open ended, and their sustainability has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show that if insecticides targeted old mosquitoes, and ideally old malaria-infected mosquitoes, they could provide effective malaria control while only weakly selecting for resistance. This alone would greatly enhance the useful life span of an insecticide. However, such weak selection for resistance can easily be overwhelmed if resistance is associated with fitness costs. In that case, late-life–acting insecticides would never be undermined by mosquito evolution. We discuss a number of practical ways to achieve this, including different use of existing chemical insecticides, biopesticides, and novel chemistry. Done right, a one-off investment in a single insecticide would solve the problem of mosquito resistance forever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-2153735978700543622?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/RD9JSFK-Xy4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241147438360"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/statistical_evidence_that_reli.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b4353b3201b4425</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Statistical evidence that religion leads to immorality</title><published>2009-05-01T03:49:57Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T03:49:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-Ld3fcRNCuo/statistical_evidence_that_reli.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/statistical_evidence_that_reli.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/30/religion.torture/index.html"&gt;Pew poll finds that church attendance is correlated with willingness to torture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of people who attend services at least once a week -- 54 percent -- said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sometimes&amp;quot; justified. Only 42 percent of people who &amp;quot;seldom or never&amp;quot; go to services agreed, according to the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp;amp; Public Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't be too smug about it, though: that difference isn't exactly huge, and 42% is a depressingly large number of non-church-goers favoring barbarous behavior.

I don’t usually pay much attention to such things, but two items caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- One billion downloads in nine months. This is a really, really big number. For perspective, this is equivalent to every man, woman, and child in the US downloading three iPhone applications. Or one out of every seven people in the entire world downloading an application. It’s one download &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/29/are-cities-just-very-large-organisms/"&gt;every time your heart beats for your whole life&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one application download for every hundred stars in the galaxy. Or one application every fourteen years, for the entire history of the Universe. This is a lot of downloads. In a market space that didn’t even exist a year ago. All of this has happened in only nine months (an average of more than 40 downloads a second, day and night, nonstop). Here’s a “visual” of one billion, from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"&gt;wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)" title="Visualizing one billion"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/visualizing_1_billion.jpg" alt="Visualizing one billion" width="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- The billionth download happened to be the application &lt;a href="http://bumptechnologies.com/"&gt;Bump&lt;/a&gt;, something &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/31/going-bump/"&gt;I posted about last month&lt;/a&gt; (and, because of April Fool’s, was considered suspect). Small world. Maybe Andy will get to shake Steve Jobs’ hand? That would be almost as exciting as &lt;a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/04/lindsay%E2%80%99s-new-and-much-older-man-revealed"&gt;my brother hanging out with Lindsay Lohan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who know me personally are aware of the circumstances, but for those who don’t, I kind of like the idea that my leaving is shrouded in conspiracy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Editorial that never was…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="httpmarkljacksonnetwp-contentuploads200901going-out-of-business-california" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/httpmarkljacksonnetwp-contentuploads200901going-out-of-business-california.jpg?w=210&amp;amp;h=143" alt="httpmarkljacksonnetwp-contentuploads200901going-out-of-business-california" width="210" height="143"&gt;Skepticism: Going out of Business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main function of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (NCSE) is to keep evolution in schools, and creationism out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCSE Executive Director &lt;strong&gt;Eugenie Scott&lt;/strong&gt; said to me recently, “Our goal is to do our work so well that we’ll eventually be out of our jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You want to go out of business?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” she confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations aren’t meant to last. Or rather, it’s hoped they won’t need to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, educational and relief organisations would not need to exist. To that end, some organisations have deliverables, time frames, plans, policies and programs. They have a specific, achievable objective. For example, the aim to teach evolution in schools but exclude pseudoscience from the school syllabus; or, to inform people about HIV/AIDS and encourage the use of preventative measures; or, to educate people about the benefits of vaccination and overcome misinformation so we can ultimately eradicate diseases such as diphtheria and polio. Skeptical groups want to promote critical thinking in schools, and society at large. But this last lofty goal raises a few questions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should skeptical groups aim to go out of business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has occasionally been said to me that skeptical movements should also aim to put themselves ‘out of business’, so to speak, and ultimately make themselves unneeded. I’ve heard a range of estimates, “We should aim to disband in 10 years.” Or 20 years, or 30 years or 50 years. There are as many vague, unsupported predictions for the end of skeptical groups as there are predictions for End Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we expecting some sort of apocalypse for pseudoscience and the paranormal? Perhaps we’re awaiting some sort of Hundredth Monkey Effect whereby we’ll all wash our sweet potatoes of skepticism, and critical thinking will instantaneously disseminate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no instant gratification. Skepticism is spread by stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a lack of critical thinking something we can eliminate entirely? Have we effectively purged credulity from ourselves? The fact is, we’re all skeptics-in-training. A relative of mine, a self-professed “hard-core skeptic”, lauded the benefits of water diving during drought on his rural property. He didn’t invariably find water, but there were times he did! As skeptics, there will always be something for us to teach, and something for us to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how will we know when our job is done? When homeopathic products are out of pharmacies? When astrology &lt;img style="margin:5px" title="httpwwwplanestupidcomfilesimagesclosed" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/httpwwwplanestupidcomfilesimagesclosed.png?w=210&amp;amp;h=171" alt="httpwwwplanestupidcomfilesimagesclosed" width="210" height="171"&gt;columns are no longer a feature in newspapers? When the crystal ball becomes a desk weight? When the “Going out of Business” sign appears on the Church door?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism isn’t like education about evolution, or eradicating smallpox. Skepticism is not just one theme. It is broad, and there are a wide range of topics that we need to tackle. There are ever-changing fads, and seemingly “unsinkable rubber ducks”.  Beliefs and practices evolve, and so too we skeptics must evolve…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges don’t mean that our objectives are hopeless, or that skeptics are ineffective. We need to be creative, patient, and vigilant. Our aim is to educate, but not overlook the ongoing need for skepticism to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was no need for skepticism, I’m sure we’d all pack up our baloney detection kits and skeptical toolboxes and go home to enjoy our skeptical Utopia. But there is a need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, skeptical groups are often accused of being self-propagating. Believers, in particular, perceive us as skeptical vampires who feed on pseudoscience and the paranormal. It was once said to me, “You need the supernatural to justify your existence!” But skepticism fills a gap, it doesn’t create one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time I was accused, “You skeptics thrive on people like &lt;strong&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Uri Geller&lt;/strong&gt;.” I replied that skeptical groups exist &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of these people; they don’t exist &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism isn’t sport. To illustrate this point I’ll reference examples featured in this issue alone; I am yet to meet a skeptic who thrives on the news story that a young girl died of whooping cough because parents in her community neglected to vaccinate their children, on the advice of anti-vaccination groups. I am yet to encounter a skeptic who relishes family arguments about religion around the holiday dinner table. I am yet to find a skeptic who delights in the unsolved mystery above solving the mystery. And I’m yet to find a skeptic who enjoys watching a psychic medium tell a crying woman that he has “made contact” with her deceased husband, who “loves” her; but she interrupts and explains that her husband is critically ill, though not dead…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism fills a need; a multi-faceted need, and an ongoing need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; has a practical purpose in addressing this need. We raise awareness of critical thinking, examine beliefs and practices, we engage in activism, especially beyond our community. This magazine aims to inspire, motivate, educate and make you think, critically, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;The Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; has a practical purpose too. This isn’t like scouring a food magazine for recipes; reading &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt; “for the articles”, or flicking though a gossip mag while you wait in the foyer of your dentist’s surgery; where you are no doubt having those dangerous amalgam fillings taken out of your mouth…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are readers with responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are on the front lines of skepticism. You close the pages of this magazine and you walk away with an everyday duty to society and a personal duty to your friends and family. You warn your mom that the colloidal silver she makes can render her skin a gray color, permanently. You advise your colleague against participating in that multi-level marketing scheme. You gently explain to your friend that the belief he’s dabbling in is more cult than religion. You comfort your frightened child with the truth that there’s no ghost in the cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism is a work-in-progress, for all of us. Just as there will always be a need for reason, science, logic, critical thinking, and plain old common sense; there will always be a need for skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will skepticism go out of business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not so much the virus that's boring - flu is a &lt;a&gt;fascinating subject&lt;/a&gt;, honestly - but the farcical, playground level of the public debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand are morons running around in a blind panic searching for decorative face masks and putting together their &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Frichpub%2Flistmania%2Ffullview%2FR176GU48QRYUQS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dcm%255Flmt%255Fsrch%255Ff%255F1%255Frsrrsi0&amp;amp;tag=laysci-21&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=19450"&gt;Zombie Survival Kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=laysci-21&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;; on the other hand are morons who believe flu is perfectly harmless really; and on a surprise third-hand floating in it's own distinct reality unattached to the other two are the conspiracy theorists, &lt;a href="http://avaginadentata.blogspot.com/2009/04/sows-ear.html"&gt;who think it's all been genetically engineered to infect our brains with socialism or something&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poor quality of debate even extends to public health issues, such as the Indonesian Health Minister, whose views are mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_369631.html"&gt;a report by the Singaporean organ "Straits Times"&lt;/a&gt; that would be funny if she wasn't responsible for the health of hundreds of millions of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversial minister did not elaborate but in the past she has said Western governments could be making and spreading viruses in the developing world to boost pharmaceutical companies' profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I'm not sure whether the virus was genetically engineered but it's a possibility,' she told reporters at a press conference called to reassure the public over the government's response to the swine flu threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving swiftly on, what's remarkable about the media coverage is the way that any sensible narrative has given way to two polarised views, neither of which bears much relation to reality. Indeed, this conflict seems to feed off of itself, as if the two sides are like some sort of estranged couple, racing to put as much distances between themselves as possible. Richard Littlejohn &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1175876/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-If-Gordon-dog-hed-down.html"&gt;leads the charge&lt;/a&gt; on one side, bemoaning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...health-scare ‘experts’ are having a field day with their Doomsday predictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but apparently failing to realize that the Doomsday predictions are mostly an invention of his own colleagues in the media rather than something taken from expert advice. In the same column he went on to rant that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One virologist, on the basis of precisely nothing, said swine flu could become crossed with bird flu and mutate into an ‘ Armageddon’ strain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clue is in your own words Richard - it was on the basis of virology and genetics, which tell us that this sort of thing does indeed happen on a fairly regular basis. But then as &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/438"&gt;I've noted before&lt;/a&gt;, watching Littlejohn attempting to understand science is like watching an&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; candidate trying to grasp the concept of humility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swine flu is a major risk, as were - and indeed still are - SARS and avian flu. The chances of a pandemic occuring in any one year is low, but when new outbreaks like this occur it is important to realise that they are capable of doing a lot of damage. Conventional flu kills around &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/keyfacts.htm"&gt;100 people a day&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. alone, over 30,000 in a year. A super-strain could very easily kill a million or more world-wide in a year. Of course conventional flu is also hugely under-rated, largely because many people pretend to have it when it fact they have nothing more than a cold. Viruses like avian flu are constantly mutating and evolving, flirting with the idea of becoming a pandemic. One day one of them will, and we need to be prepared for that eventuality, because it will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course these people aren't really reacting to expert advice so much as to the more hysterical voices in the echo-chamber of the media. Earlier this evening I popped out to my local Indian for a curry, and while waiting had a flick through a copy of The Sun that was on the counter. Nestled in amongst all the boobs was a sea of chilling warnings of a "killer virus" and the "threat to humanity." In this respect, the papers remind me a bit of the Warden in&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a&gt;Dad's Army&lt;/a&gt; - yes it is important that we put the lights out, but could you please just not be quite so mental about it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, some bloke from the olden days has said what I want to say far more eloquently than I can, so let's copy-paste good old&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a&gt;George Bernard Shaw&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Newspapers are unable, seemingly, to discriminate between a bicycle accident and the collapse of civilisation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's where reality lies - in the middle. The world isn't a black and white place, things aren't good or bad, a situation isn't dangerous or safe, there are risks, and a useful media - a media helpful to democracy - would present a clear and sober assessment of those risks. But clear and sober just isn't on the agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

I guess when you get a state that big, you get conflicting news from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The bad news: First it was science, and now &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/ed-board-extremists-target-social-studies/"&gt;the state Board of Education is attacking social studies&lt;/a&gt;. What do these doofi have against people who are actually knowledgeable and trained in their fields of study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The good news: &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/mcleroy-confirmation-chances-get-slimmer/"&gt;The Texas legislature is on the verge of doing the right thing&lt;/a&gt;: canning creationist Don McLeroy as the head of the state Board of Education. Let’s hope that’s one door that does in fact hit him on the derriere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which is it? Good news or bad? I guess, like many things in reality, it’s both. But given the past few months, it’s not too far-fetched to guess that even if McLeroy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; given the (cowboy) boot, the Lone Star creationists will find some other aspect of life to screw up miserably for the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that — and not to tick off any reality-based Texan BABloggees out there — I hope you take &lt;a href="http://www.superpoop.com/042709/texas-secession.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in the light intended: making fun of those among you who want to snuff out the candle of science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think there’s hope for Texas, and for the rest of us, or else I wouldn’t be writing about this. But the price for that hope is to continue the fight.

The fake editorial board (see &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540001.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) of this fake journal includes some well known luminaries (Reid, Seeman, Ebeling).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside, Professor Peter Brooks was Executive Dean of Health Sciences at the University of Queensland at the time the University came down hard on &lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2008/04/gardasil-scandal-university-of.html"&gt;Dr Andrew Gunn&lt;/a&gt; for asking scientific questions in public about a Merck drug which earns the University a mint (Brooks was not one of the bullies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also of interest is the regular appearance of clinicians who held postdoctoral positions at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) from 1975 to 1985 in the list of clinicians involved in dubious practices in the field of osteoporosis. In this instance, even though this is an Australasian list, there are two such appearances (Peter Ebeling and Ego Seeman both trained at the Mayo under Professor Larry Riggs).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial board of "The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Jim Bertouch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consultant Rheumatologist, NSW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Peter Brooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Executive Dean (Health Sciences)&lt;br&gt;University of Queensland&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Richard Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;St Vincent's Hospital, NSW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Peter Ebeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Royal Melbourne Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor John Hart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monash University&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Michael Hooper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concord Repatriation General Hospital&lt;br&gt;Sydney&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Julien de Jager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Geoff Littlejohn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monash Medical Centre&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Peter Nash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Nicholas Pocock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;St Vincent's Hospital, NSW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Ian Reid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;University of Auckland&lt;br&gt;New Zealand&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Philip Sambrook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sydney University&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor I Ego Seeman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor David  Sonnabend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Royal North Shore Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/04/fake-bone-journals.html"&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/05/allegations-of-fraud-at-albany-wang.html"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/30682564-2049063211327785918?l=scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Aubrey Blumsohn)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog</id><title type="html">Scientific Misconduct Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241135273045"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-30682564.post-6353056247867824806">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/285e28c017db6813</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Osteoporosis" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Merck" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Fake bone journals</title><published>2009-04-30T21:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T21:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/04/fake-bone-journals.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://www.thejabberwock.org/blogl/wrd.jpg" width="180" height="242" border="0" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55671/"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; comes news of a fake bone journal produced by Elsevier for Merck. "The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine" was a bit of fakery which gave the appearance of a proper scientific journal (like the "proper" bone journal, the &lt;a href="http://www.thejabberwock.org/wiki/index.php?title=Actonel_Media_reports_2007"&gt;Journal of Bone and Mineral Research&lt;/a&gt; which is reputedly entirely uninfluenced by industry manipulation). Merck apparently paid an undisclosed sum in exchange for the fakery. Sample scans of complete issues are &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540001.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://images.the-scientist.com/pdfs/blogs/MSD0503540027.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55671/"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; (free registration required).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merck published fake journal, Bob Grant, 30th April 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Abstracted summary]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Merck paid an undisclosed sum to Elsevier to produce several volumes of a publication that had the look of a peer-reviewed medical journal, but contained only reprinted or summarized articles--most of which presented data favorable to Merck products--that appeared to act solely as marketing tools with no disclosure of company sponsorship. &lt;br&gt;[snip]&lt;br&gt;The Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine, which was published by Exerpta Medica, a division of scientific publishing juggernaut Elsevier. The issues contained little in the way of advertisements apart from ads for Fosamax, a Merck drug for osteoporosis, and Vioxx. &lt;br&gt;[snip]&lt;br&gt;It came to light in the context of a civil suit filed by Graeme Peterson, who suffered a heart attack in 2003 while on Vioxx, against Merck and its Australian subsidiary, Merck, Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme Australia (MSDA). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In testimony provided at the trial last week, which was obtained by The Scientist, George Jelinek, an Australian physician and long-time member of the World Association of Medical Editors, reviewed four issues of the journal that were published from 2003-2004. An "average reader" (presumably a doctor) could easily mistake the publication for a "genuine" peer reviewed medical journal, he said in his testimony. "Only close inspection of the journals, along with knowledge of medical journals and publishing conventions, enabled me to determine that the Journal was not, in fact, a peer reviewed medical journal, but instead a marketing publication for MSD[A]." &lt;br&gt;[snip]&lt;br&gt;A spokesperson for Elsevier, however, told The Scientist, "I wish there was greater disclosure that it was a sponsored journal." Disclosure of Merck's funding of the journal was not mentioned anywhere in the copies of issues obtained by The Scientist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elsevier acknowledged that Merck had sponsored the publication, but did not disclose the amount the drug company paid. &lt;br&gt;[snip]&lt;br&gt;The spokesperson added that Elsevier had no plans to look further into the matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the members of Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine's "Honorary Editorial Board," Peter Brooks, a rheumatologist in Australia, said he didn't recall who asked him to serve on the board, but noted that he was on Merck's Asian Pacific and international advisory boards from the mid 1990s until about 2004, as well as the advisory boards of other pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Amgen. "You get involved in a whole bunch of things at this level," Brooks said, adding that he had put his name on "a few advertorials" for pharmaceutical companies about 10 years ago. &lt;br&gt;[truncated]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2008/09/did-nz-drug-regulator-do-some.html"&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/04/fake-editorial-board-of-mercks-fake.html"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/30682564-6353056247867824806?l=scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Aubrey Blumsohn)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog</id><title type="html">Scientific Misconduct Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241132737495"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_truth_about_autistic_females">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b5c44c536059923</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Truth About Autistic Females</title><published>2009-04-30T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_truth_about_autistic_females" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Ed. This is today's second guest post--I'll post about what I was up to instead of writing on Wednesday, promise!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/upnorthmemories/921353170/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1072/921353170_878b983dd7.jpg?v=0" alt="a black and white vintage looking photo of a girl of about 6 or 7 running across a very narrow wooden pedestrian bridge holding a net up in her right hand and grinning" width="300" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greetings and salutations Change.org readers! When I asked Dora which of my previous posts received the most attention, she mentioned &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/blasting_stereotypes_in_autistic_females"&gt;Blasting Stereotypes in Autistic Females&lt;/a&gt;, hence the inspiration for this post. Oh, and by the way, the girl with the gorgeous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe_shoes"&gt;pointe shoes&lt;/a&gt; on (in the photo below) is me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I lied. That girl in the photo below is not me. But it could have been me, right? That is if I were a dancer for &lt;a href="http://www.obt.org/"&gt;Oregon Ballet Theater&lt;/a&gt;. Oh well, a lady can dream. My point--no pun intended--is that it is not beyond the realms of autism for an autistic female to have a special interest in something like ballet.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aliciajrose/267081003/in/set-72157604823664225/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/267081003_f9bba8a7aa.jpg?v=0" alt="a colorful costume shop in the background, a young woman dressed in silver shorts, shirt, and many rings and bracelets stands on a chair and strikes a ballet pose in pink pointe shoes" style="float:right;margin:10px" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the autism advocacy groups I am involved with, here in Portland, has quite an array of autistic females with various interests. We have a ballet dancer (me), three artists who enjoy painting, a beadwork designer, a gymnast, a glam rock fan, and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_and_Joon"&gt;Benny &amp;amp; Joon&lt;/a&gt; fanatic. That noted, we all have extremely individual appearances including tastes in clothing and hair styles, as well as unique mannerisms, nuances, and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The males in our group are almost all heavily drawn to computers. Video games are also popular. One of our guys is a comic book collector and another one is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)"&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV Series)&lt;/a&gt; enthusiast--much to Dora's and my delight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of education, I am going to expose some personal bits of myself: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I despise having to get ready for the day, but I go all out using fancy girly stuff in the shower, even delving into a little make-up and hair product when I get out. Then I dress in what I perceive to be fashionable, yet simple, clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter what I may look like on the outside, on the inside, my executive functioning skills are unreliable and extremely fragile to the effects of stress.  Though I should win an oscar for putting on a pleasant social face and for having *stellar* eye contact (largely due to my hearing loss and the need to read lips), I am constantly monitoring myself out of fear that I will say or do something unexpected and/or inappropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am the polar opposite of the type of person who needs to be around people at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have difficulty caring for people other than myself. Did I mention that I have two kids? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I struggle with simple math.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have severe sensory issues, especially with certain types of noises, visual distractions, and touches. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have mild motor planning issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have absolutely no instinct that propels me to feel sorry for things that seem trivial or easily fixed with logic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I experience difficulty with certain types of changes or transitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Neurotypicals (written with love) in my life have field days teasing me about my narrow interests and passions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch out, I've been known to monologue--especially on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does all of this mean? Why am I sharing, or rather airing, this small list of things about myself? What's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I am but one teensy drop of water in the sea of autistic females. I'm one wave, one tide, and one grain of sand. Simply put, I am but a small part of a dynamic subset of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly is the truth about autistic females? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drum roll...autistic females are individuals with sames and differences just like any other factor belonging to the human population. Are the differences between people with blond hair and blue eyes not infinite? Of course, and so much so that only the eyes and hair color can be counted on as identifying factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's hope to see some real changes for females in the &lt;a href="http://www.psych.org/dsmv.asp"&gt;DSM V&lt;/a&gt; Autism Spectrum Condition criteria expected in 2012. Too many autistic females are being misdiagnosed, or declined a diagnosis, due to the rampant misunderstandings surrounding us. This is detrimental to both the psyche and well-being of this autistic spectrum population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With there being so much more to learn about autism and its many expressions, why are males and females being thrown into the same box? Or even worse, denied a distinction?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Elesia Ashkenazy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241131220052"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2220">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ac54d5ddf06e49f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism Science Foundation: a Research based org</title><published>2009-04-30T20:04:40Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T20:04:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/bKAteRuM1oc/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241130672789"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/what_are_you_doing_alberta.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c1c8664ad4da467</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">What are you doing, Alberta?</title><published>2009-04-30T23:04:06Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T23:04:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/dghZgXfnhCE/what_are_you_doing_alberta.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/what_are_you_doing_alberta.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The province of &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/04/30/cgy-bill-evolution-law-alberta-classes-teachers.html"&gt;Alberta has decided to make education optional&lt;/a&gt;. If there's something in the real world that you don't like, such as that you evolved from other apes, or that gay people exist, or perhaps that understanding the motion of bodies requires some of that difficult math stuff, students will be allowed to close their eyes and plug their ears and pretend those uncomfortable complexities don't exist. How sweet! And then they can graduate without ever learning anything new, and go on to be ignorant voters who will no doubt continue the trend of dumbing down everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very stupid move by stupid people that will produce more stupid people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It neglects a fundamental property of education: that in order to learn, you have to be exposed to many new and sometimes difficult ideas. We teach about subjects that no one thinks are good, because you need to know about them to have an informed opinion. The Holocaust was horrible and painful — &lt;a href="http://www.calgarysun.com/news/columnists/rick_bell/2009/04/30/9299176-sun.html"&gt;shall we allow children to avoid exposure to it&lt;/a&gt;? Fundamentalist parents may gnash their teeth in fury at the very idea of evolution — but how can they disagree with it rationally, if they don&amp;#39;t even know what it is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow we've acquired this bizarre notion that learning is about being eased along, never stressing ourselves, never facing a challenge. We've mistaken education for an exercise in affirmation. And now Alberta wants to enshrine that idea in their educational system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least if the future creates a lot of demand for jobs that require smugly oblivious, incompetent people, industry will know precisely where to go for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/what_are_you_doing_alberta.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/dghZgXfnhCE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241125594987"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_time_to_go_beyond_autism_awareness">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ebce271c41f7fca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">It's Time to Go Beyond Autism Awareness</title><published>2009-04-30T21:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T21:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_time_to_go_beyond_autism_awareness" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://laist.com/attachments/lindsayrebecca/Desert_Road.jpg" height="180" alt="Desert road from http://laist.com/attachments/lindsayrebecca/Desert_Road.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="230"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As of today, Autism Awareness Month 2009 comes to an end, and it seems to me it's high time that we &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/go_beyond_autism_awareness"&gt;go beyond autism awareness&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/go_beyond_autism_awareness"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/go_beyond_autism_awareness"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt; about doing this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that "autism awareness" is a bad idea. But too often now, saying "let's do X in support of autism awareness!" is taken as an end in itself. This suggests that "just knowing about" autism (citing the prevalence rate, rattling off a few of the DSM-IV criteria, mentioning Temple Grandin) means you've done your part, and that's not the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being "aware" that autism exists, that individuals on the autism spectrum exist right now, right here, and probably right near you, is just a beginning. Jim and I feel pretty aware about autism, but we know we're still near the start of a long road to help prepare the best life possible for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a friend asked me about what exactly Jim and I have done as far as planning ahead for Charlie when we're gone. I know the basics that he'll need: a job, a place to live, things to do when he's not at the job, companionship. But providing for these is simply overwhelming, yet necessary, to contemplate. If we could buy a house, hire staff, train them, find an employer who'd employ Charlie, find things for him to do in the community when he's not at the job, find transporation for him to all of these places---I guess I would feel that things were somewhat set for Charlie. As things are, not a one of them is in place and the options that currently exist need a lot of improvements, to understate the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How aware are most people about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autism Awareness" was just a starting point. Time now to move on, and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/go_beyond_autism_awareness"&gt;Go beyond autism awareness&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241123948403"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_fashion_police_can_be_so_c.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66d547e43b5df7a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">The fashion police can be so cruel…</title><published>2009-04-30T21:19:54Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T21:19:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/hrIh6O0SJ0g/the_fashion_police_can_be_so_c.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_fashion_police_can_be_so_c.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped a beat, I pressed a knuckle to my mouth, my eyelashes fluttered wildly as I tried to hold back my tears as I read this &lt;a href="http://whatnottocrochet.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/i-dont-care-how-visionary-it-is/"&gt;cutting review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that reminder also reminds me that I'll be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/a_video_contest.php"&gt;judging&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/contests/evolution-in-two-minutes-or-less/"&gt;video contest&lt;/a&gt; after 1 June — you only have one more month to put together an entry to explain evolution in two minutes or less. Eric Hovind is welcome to enter — a little comedy relief is always nice — but I think his videos are more of an anti-inspiration. Put him to shame with some substance! Look at his shoddy work and resolve to show the world how it is realy done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/the-australian-antivax-movement-takes-its-toll/"&gt;Australian antivax news story&lt;/a&gt; has had quite the impact. Channel 7 in Oz has decided to record a forum discussing the antivax tactics and the real science of vaccinations and autism; amazingly, &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/anti-vaxers-the-story-so-far/"&gt;as Dr. Rachie reports&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t want antivax mouthpieces like the horrid Meryl Dorrey on the show; they only want people with a science background! Imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of autism, it looks like researchers have, for the very first time, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090428/hl_nm/us_autism_genes"&gt;found a genetic link to autism&lt;/a&gt;! This is fantastic news. The causes behind autism are basically unknown (though we do know what doesn’t cause it: vaccines!), and this is a very good first step in unraveling this complex and terribly difficult problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; The Skeptic Zone and &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2009/04/important-message-swine-flu/"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; have created a one-page flier decrying quacks who claim to have treatments for the swine flu or meningococcal meningitis… medicines &lt;em&gt;which are homeopathic&lt;/em&gt;. Only one letter separates SCAM and SCUM, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a JPG of the flyer, and the link above goes to the PDF. Spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

You can follow the proceedings on Twitter, of course - &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/triangletweetup" title=""&gt;@triangletweetup&lt;/a&gt;. You will also be able to watch it &lt;a href="http://triangletweetup.org/live/" title=""&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the list of attendees, I see several names that are familiar, including my SciBling Abel PharmBoy who has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/04/triangle_tweetup_tonight.php" title=""&gt;blogged about the event&lt;/a&gt; in much greater detail. Then, there will of course be people like Ginny Skalsky, Wayne Sutton, Lenore Ramm and the amazing Rachel of @DPAC. I am assuming that Bob Etheridge on the list is really the NC congressman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I am a relatively recent migrant onto Twitter. While I have been using Facebook for over 5 years, and FriendFeed for a year, I only got on Twitter late last November. But I managed to &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/30/plos-one-on-twitter-and-friendfeed/" title=""&gt;grok it&lt;/a&gt;, I think, pretty quickly since then, and see it as a part of a new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_journalistic_workflow.php" title=""&gt;Journalistic Workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is more than one way to use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;b&gt;Lifecasting&lt;/b&gt; by taking the "What are you doing?" question too literally. Short messages about personal whereabouts and activities are important information that is always exchanged between people, but is much more meaningful between people who actually know each other. The human connection is just as important online as it is offline. Almost everyone on Twitter does this sometimes, and that's perfectly fine, but if that's all you post, you are only interesting to your Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;b&gt;Broadcasting&lt;/b&gt; if all your tweets are imported RSS feeds from your blog or news. This is fine if you are a news organization (yes, follow BBC and NPR and CNN on Twitter - you get fresh news that way), or your job is PR, but for an individual, perhaps the &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix/6d458c28/twitter-rule-1-nothing-automated-no-automatic" title=""&gt;Twitter rule #1&lt;/a&gt; still stands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing automated. No automatic follows. No RSS feeds. Just be yourself, be fun, and be Useful!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_journalistic_workflow.php" title=""&gt;Mindcasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, where Twitter is your first in a series of tools, aggregating information and getting feedback, while building a bigger story. I tried it for the first time last week, using a more light-hearted topic - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/do_you_love_or_hate_cilantro.php" title=""&gt;Cilantro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that who you follow (their quality) is much more important that who follows you (quantity). But if you follow many people, remember &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ/status/1661457692" title=""&gt;Twitter Rule #2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your brain is the best filtering tool, so fine-tune it. You are not obligated to read every tweet in your stream.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More rules still to come ;-) Perhaps I'll learn some more later today. See ya tonight!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/triangle_tweetup_tonight.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/pBnLo2aRUJk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241120381860"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/that_explains_a_lot.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/35bf462acea0529f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">That explains a lot</title><published>2009-04-30T20:01:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T20:01:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/fTXgJ6hOrN0/that_explains_a_lot.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/that_explains_a_lot.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post has been getting a lot of grief around scienceblogs lately, since they've been letting some astounding woo slip through under the guise of medicine and science.

&lt;p&gt;My theory is, our hands are extremely nervous appendages; the most nervous, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Our hands often tremble at very odd times. Like when we’re happy. When we’re depressed. When we have a palsy-inducing hang over. When we win the Miss America pageant, and when we’re selected to be a contestant on &lt;em&gt;The Price is Right&lt;/em&gt;. You don’t see feet doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands are quick to skittishness to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hands are also frightfully shy. If we’re not clutching a cocktail or a cigarette or, I don’t know, a bazooka or something while we’re talking to people we don’t know very well, our hands waste no time slipping away to hide in our pockets. (Mine actually went through a phase where they would hide in other people’s pockets. But that’s a different story altogether, and pending litigation prevents me from elaborating at this time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you give your hands a difficult task, like carrying a mug of molten lava from the break room to your office, they’re cool, calm, and collected — until you look down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment they feel eyes on them, scrutinizing them, judging them, they begin to tremble nervously, and you soon wind up in the burn ward with a catcher’s mitt of gauze wrapped around the end of your arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suppose we really can’t blame our hands for being nervous. Hands sometimes get a bad rap, and are no doubt a little gun-shy about a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit, for years lechers the world over have been referred to as being “all hands”, as though disenchanted, troubled hands travel in roving packs or gangs, and somehow coalesce into grabby, womanizing perverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when someone is discovered in the act of doing something wrong, we say they were “caught red-handed”. I can only assume this expression was coined when an unfortunate thief tried to steal someone’s coffee and then looked down at the mug during the getaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands have had to endure a lot of strife over the years. Aside from the various unpleasant personal tasks they must carry out for us each day, hands have experienced the pain of being slammed in doors, of having firecrackers explode in them, and of catching footballs on cold days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve displayed hope when folded in prayer and heartache when wrung until raw when those prayers go unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve been instruments of violence, made into fists to engage our enemies. And they’ve been symbols of submission, raised to our faces to fend off attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/peacesign.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/peacesign.jpg" alt="peacesign" width="75" height="100"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They can signal our displeasure with our fellow man one minute, and show our longing for peace the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve been dipped into the foulest things on Earth, and they’ve even been washed incessantly by obsessive compulsives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can’t really fault hands for some of their shortcomings. It’s a hard life being a hand. It really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you’ve got to hand it to hands; for the most part, they’re pretty good things to have. After all, our fingers and opposable thumbs are what helped us get to the top of the food chain. Because of our hands, we made tools and developed technology that has allowed us to sail the oceans, to fly at the speed of sound, to communicate on a global scale, and most importantly, to play Rock/Paper/Scissors.&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/applause.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/applause.gif" alt="applause" width="320" height="237"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite the violence and harm we perpetrate with our hands, we also use them to express affection, holding tenderly to the hand of a child as we cross the street, or a lover as we walk along the beach. We use them to soothe and excite with caresses in the name of passion. And we use them to amuse and entertain in the name of the Pull My Finger game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, imagine what life would be like without hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would we greet each other? How would we hitch-hike or flag down a cab? How would we show our appreciation at the end of a show? How would we point out the nearest restroom? What would we wash to prevent Swine flu? How would rappers signal to they homies? How would small children tell us how old they are? How would athletes give high fives? How would we enjoy Internet porn? How would Italians talk? How would we pull up our socks? And how would we make rude noises with our armpits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, we derive value from our hands, and we do it hand over fist. In short, they are our little five-fingered miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can you do with your hands? What special hand-related talents do you have? Juggling? Magic? Shadow puppets? Is this the silliest Afternoon Inquisition yet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241117524657"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/30/lhc-restart/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7d638801c4e36ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">LHC Restart</title><published>2009-04-30T18:39:53Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T18:39:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/30/lhc-restart/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1028023"&gt;CERN announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the final replacement LHC magnet was lowered into the tunnel, and is making its way to Sector 3-4 (between collision points 3 and 4). Last September’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/09/19/lhc-first-magnet-failure/"&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt; led to 53 magnets - about half a kilometer of the 27-km ring - having to be removed, repaired or cleaned, and replaced.   Check out the video of the final dipole going in on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/article?issue=19/2009&amp;amp;name=CERNBulletin&amp;amp;category=News%20Articles&amp;amp;number=3&amp;amp;ln=en" title="dipole.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/dipole.gif" alt="dipole.gif" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New systems are being installed to better detect incipient magnet quenches, and the helium pressure relief systems are being upgraded.  My understanding is that this will be done on the greater part of the LHC magnets this year, but not all of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to complete the installation of the replacement magnets, and then cool down all sectors.  At present, &lt;a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/Cooldown_status.htm"&gt;half the machine is being held at liquid nitrogen temperatures,&lt;/a&gt; and the other half is at room temperature.  It will take a couple months, once they start, to cool the whole machine down to superconducting temperature, about 2 degrees K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by late summer the LHC commissioning can begin where it left off last September.  Assuming all goes well, physics collisions are foreseen at 10 TeV by late fall.  The machine will not run at the design energy of 14 TeV at least until the entire machine is retrofit with the new quench detection and pressure relief systems.  And, the beam intensity (and hence collision luminosity) will not be anywhere near the ultimate goal during the first physics run.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual running pattern at CERN is to start in the spring, and collide beams through the late fall, and do machine maintenance, etc. during the winter when electric power is more expensive in Europe (they heat with nukes, basically; we burn fossil fuel in the US in winter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a decision was reached &lt;a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2009/PR02.09E.html"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to run the LHC through next winter, with only a brief two-week shutdown for Christmas and New Year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can reasonably expect is that if all goes well, we can accumulate something like 100 inverse picobarns of collisions by spring 2010, and perhaps 200 pb&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; by the end of the run in fall, 2010.  Now, pb&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; this is a strange unit - it has dimensions of inverse area.  Formally we call it integrated luminosity.  Basically it tells you how many collisions you’ve had, in essence.  To get the number of some type of interesting events, you need to know the cross section - which has units of area - for producing that type of event.  Then you simply multiply the cross section times the integrated luminosity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the machine shuts down in late 2010, and if we do have a sample of about 200 pb&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, there will ensue a long shut down in 2010-2011 to complete the magnet retrofit.  The LHC will then not run until late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the lower-energy, relatively small sample of physics data is all we will have to analyze until 2012, three years from now!  The experiments have already been simulating collisions at the lower energy and retuning analyses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though everyone is waiting breathlessly for the LHC to discover the Higgs boson, with lower energy and a smaller sample, I would not bet on the LHC finding it any time before 2012.  In fact, a full analysis of the Higgs sensitivity at 10 TeV is yet to be done in ATLAS and CMS.  This is a huge task, and will take months, but there is no question that it is more difficult at the lower energy, and it’s already very hard for the LHC to see, say, a 120 GeV Higgs boson.  As I wrote in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/13/closing-in-on-the-higgs-boson/"&gt;my post in March&lt;/a&gt;, this is also very hard for the Tevatron in the same time period.  Those of us looking for a standard model Higgs boson have to exercise a bit of patience while working very hard toward the ultimate goal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neverheless, there is a ton of new physics that *could* emerge from even the first LHC physics sample from the 2009/10 run.  If nature has new high-mass particles giving observable pair-production resonances at energies not accessible at the Tevatron, they could stand out in sharp relief above the standard model.  Similarly if there are extra dimensions of space time, we may see excess pair production of standard model particles.  If supersymmetry exists, and the experiments manage to understand well the apparent missing momentum transverse to the beam direction (a big challenge) then a first observation of the presence of supersymmetric particles might be possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, all you can do is admire the wisdom of the great Zen master Yogi Berra, who said “If this was easy it wouldn’t be so hard!”  But then, maybe we’ll get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

This second installment elaborates on our findings on data from the second clinical trial in Nicaragua. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should first explain the title. In order for homeopathy to operate as a base or operating system for medicine “for the 21st century,” the entire system of measurement and of course all physical laws would have to be changed. In analogous political terms, it would be similar to - but more massive a change than - changing a nation from a democracy to a completely different system such as a theocracy with completely different laws and behavior expectations. So…well, it was the best I could think up at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=460"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; I recounted how the Jacobs ll trial setup was incoherent and unable to produce  results that could prove efficacy - unless the differences between treatment and controls were quite large,  greater than just barely significant. Most patients were treated differently from others, with multiple preparations (that were in reality the same: pill filler) at differing times during the illness, with each preparation selected according to symptoms that likely varied by the hour, and influenced by memory, well known to be faulty in medical studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, given the lack of homogeneity in the trial diagnoses and treatments, outcomes should not have made sense at all.  Now I must admit that the thought did not occur to us at the time we undertook the review, nor during the review. If it had, our job would have been easier and the paper shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we saw that children with severe dehydration  were hospitalized, placed in IV fluids, and not entered in the trial. Milder cases were continued on diet and given standard oral rehydration therapy. They were assessed by homeopathic interviews regarding stool quality, general condition, and emotional states, then randomized to treatment and control groups. The major outcome was stated to have been determined beforehand as the mean number of days to fewer then 3 unformed stools on two consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at tables and graphs and saw that the treatment-control differences seemed to be significant and consistent at all days measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was: treated, mean of 3.0 days, and for untreated, 3.8 days (P&amp;lt;.05). And, there was a difference at 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting treatment  Four other diarrhea indicators showed P=.048, .036, .054, .037.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the results were actually illustrations of the difference between statistical significance and clinical significance. At 72 hrs, the point of maximum difference (P&amp;lt;0.5,) the difference was between 3 stools per day and 2 per day.  The differences on the other days were all less than 1 per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked further and found recording and computation errors in several tables. None alone seemed large enough to account for the statistical findings, but suggested that enough other errors might lie hidden in the record to account for the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant finding was the result of culturing the stools. All subjects had stools cultured. Children in the homeopathy treatment group had half again as many positive stool cultures for bacterial pathogens as did the controls. This led us to the possibility that all or many of the children might have been given antibiotics, either through adulterated homeopathic preparations, or at some time outside of the researchers’ observations.  A few such patients could have accounted for the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were presented as the mean values without data points for all patients. In such presentation, there is a possibility that one or two outliers might have existed in either group or both to have resulted in the differing means. Without the raw data, we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as mentioned last time, the data were the results of heterogeneous entry data to which were applied statistics that assume data have some degree of homogeneity. Another problem casting doubt on the meaning of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to all the irregularities and lack of clinical significance were the claims and language of the authors. The authors referred for authority of homeopathic validity to the discredited Benveniste study in Nature (1998.)  That study, if it were valid and authentic,  actually disproved the major thesis of homeopathy and showed the selection of dilutions to be arbitrary and effects unpredictable.(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jacobs paper authors inflated the significance of their findings with phrasing like: “Acute diarrhea is the leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality world-wide. In the developing world there are 1.3 billion episodes of diarrhea and 5 million deaths each years from this illness..” But a public health impact is not suggested by this study. Children with severe diarrhea - the ones likely to die - were not included, and sent to a hospital. There was nothing about homeopathy in children with severe diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they stated, “ Acute childhood diarrhea [is] ideal for …homeopathic trial because …no standard allopathic [sic] treatment would have to be withheld and … the public health importance … is great.”  But the trial used children with mild diarrhea.  It is hard to imagine a great public health importance for a method that shortens by less than a day a self-limited illness that resolves spontaneously in four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up with enough findings to conclude that the study was devised in a way as to render its results nul, to suspect its authors of hyping an idea, and with enough errors to suspect that even more lay hidden in the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time I will explore its sequel, a repeat of the study in… oh, yes, Nepal. Of course. And then on to the pinnacle of the quartet, the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars are born when gas clouds in galaxies collapse. Eddies form, clumps and knots of higher density gas a hundred billion kilometers across, which then contract under their own gravity and form stars. Sometimes, galaxies undergo violent bursts of star formation, making huge numbers of stars all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it look like when that happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-19-a-print.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3584/3488317259_0ba104a95b_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit: NASA, ESA, K. McQuinn (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis), and I. Karachentsev (Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coooooool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/19/full/"&gt;Hubble’s view of the nearby dwarf galaxy IC 4662&lt;/a&gt;. At 8 million light years distant, it’s one of the closest galaxies in the sky, and that makes it a perfect target for all kinds of investigations. In this case, astronomers targeted IC 4662 and several other nearby dwarf galaxies — smaller-than-usual galaxies, much smaller than our Milky Way — to try to understand how stars form in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IC 4662 is undergoing a current burst in star formation even as we watch. See those two big red regions? Those are gigantic clouds of gas furiously forming new stars. Take a close look at them: you can see how they appear to be less red in the middle, and there are lots of stars there. That’s because massive stars born inside the clouds blast out ultraviolet light and strong winds of subatomic particles (like a super solar wind), eating away at the gas and carving out a giant bubble in the cloud. That kind of structure is a sure sign that stars are being born at a high rate&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#blowoutfootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we already knew this! What’s new here is that it appears that in these dwarf galaxies, star formation happens in waves, starting in one place and sweeping across the entire galaxy over time. That’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting, and surprising. It was thought that these starbursts, in general, just happened in one location and lasted for a few million years. Now it looks like they &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; that way, but then spread out from there like an infection, with the whole process lasting for &lt;em&gt;two hundred&lt;/em&gt; million years or more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tells us something about the way stars form in these galaxies, which also tells us about their structure, how the gas clouds are laid out, and how these galaxies behave. We care about this for two reasons: one is that we are pretty sure that big galaxies, like our own, form by the collision and merger of smaller dwarf galaxies like this one. The more we understand about dwarf galaxies, the better a picture we get of the history and composition of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also care because this is just so very cool. We can watch as stars are born in other galaxies! We can understand how this happens, why it happens, and what the implications are… and we do it using an observatory orbiting our planet, pointed toward a cosmic collection of stars and gas that lies &lt;em&gt;80 quintillion&lt;/em&gt; kilometers away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always try to remember that when you read something about science. We do this stuff because it’s important, but we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; do it because it’s so tremendously wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="blowoutfootnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;If you download &lt;a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-19-d-full_jpg.jpg"&gt;the ginormous version of this image&lt;/a&gt; (it’s 5Mb) you can see faint, arc-shaped extensions to the two reddish gas clouds (above the one at the top of the picture, and below the one at the bottom). I suspect that’s where the furious winds from the stars have literally popped the bubbles; what astronomers call a blowout for obvious reasons. You can see that the hollow parts of the clouds &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; toward those blowouts, just as you’d expect if the stars inside had pushed on the cloud itself and caused it to pop in that direction. Tres, tres cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241113400695"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4699600605590143592">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/228ca74a0a3451e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">NCSE v National Association of Biology Teachers</title><published>2009-04-30T17:08:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T17:42:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/ncse-v-national-association-of-biology.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4699600605590143592/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4699600605590143592" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> There&amp;#39;s been a lot of discussion recently about the proper role of scientific organizations, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), The Royal Society, and the National Academies of Science (NAS), in the conflict between science and religion.

Both had previously been funded, and it is hard to imagine how these results are sensible.  I think sharing stories like this is very important because otherwise a) researchers can become very discouraged, and b) systemic problems with the review system may go unnoticed for a long time.  As Dr. Nancy Reid (University of Toronto) stated, individuals in this situation should not "hide in the office feeling you’ve done something wrong".  I am planning to share some of my own experiences with NSERC peer review soon.  But in the meantime, you can read the plea from Dr. France Dufresne (Université du Québec à Rimouski) &lt;a href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/young-investigators-plea-4-grad-students-with-no-income-and-money-to-carry-on/#more-1074"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Reid has graciously allowed me to repost her message below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As news about the results of this year's discovery  grant competition trickle out, the list of alarming stories seems to grow.  Here is my story. &lt;p&gt; My DG grant was cut this year from $48,000 to $25,000.  Grants in statistics tend to be low, and our GSC (14) is perpetually short of money.  My grant of $48k was the largest among those re-applying this year, and among the top 5 or so in the country.  The last few years have seen most of the top grants cut to help the pressure on junior people who need to move up through  the system.  So I expected to see a decrease in my grant.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, I didn't expect to be knee-capped.  This is just $1k short of  the maximum cut allowed (50%).   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My first reactions were deeply personal: I assumed that my standing, my research, and my training of HQP had been found wanting, I assumed that this was probably a correct judgment, and I started asking myself whether it was time to think about retiring. I asked myself why a group of my peers felt that it was necessary to deliver such a blow, even if I was judged to be slipping. I was embarrassed to tell even my closest friends what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But wait!  The referees'  &lt;a href="http://utstat.utoronto.ca/reid/nserc-reports.pdf"&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; are quite positive! I looked at my  &lt;a href="http://utstat.utoronto.ca/reid/proposal-09.pdf"&gt; proposal&lt;/a&gt; again: it was not bad!  I had a long list of HQP!  I had won a national and an international award! In fact, my proposal, my record of  publication, training and achievement are very similar to past  competitions.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, as we all know, NSERC instituted a completely different mechanism for determining grant amounts.  They will of course be monitoring the situation, and assessing what worked and what didn't.  On their  &lt;a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Media-Media/NewsRelease-CommuniqueDePresse_eng.asp?ID=126"&gt; web page&lt;/a&gt;  we read: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; The emphasis on quality assessment under the new common rating system  has achieved the desired objectives. It preserves continuity of funding for the  most productive researchers who maintain a strong record of contributions to research and training. It also permits a more rapid ramp up of funding for applicants with superior accomplishments and research plans, no matter their history in the system. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sounds admirable.  But is it working? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We won't know unless we share our stories.  And NSERC won't know unless it hears from us. Don't hide in your office feeling that you've done something wrong.  If there is any doubt in your mind about the adequacy of the review process  and the outcome for your Discovery Grant,   &lt;b&gt; submit an  &lt;a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/Policies-Politiques/appeals-appel_eng.asp"&gt; appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.   And share your story.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I suppose it should be pointed out that the writing, reviewing, and denial of the proposals from these two productive researchers cost taxpayers about $80,000 according to one &lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content%7Econtent=a909104450"&gt;recent analysis&lt;/a&gt;.  Again, we should ask whether the peer review system is working as well as it should, or indeed whether it should be abandoned in favour of baseline grants for all qualified researchers in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a similar experience to share, I encourage you to visit &lt;a href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/"&gt;Don't Leave Canada Behind&lt;/a&gt; and post your story.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-5694367872574242366?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/H2mzd3qaTfA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241111317378"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/memorable_procrastination.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/98913cf1e80807e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Memorable procrastination</title><published>2009-04-30T17:06:55Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T17:06:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/7ikg_SZ1b-g/memorable_procrastination.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/memorable_procrastination.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.

Why? Because &lt;a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3573761/creating-an-insult-to-intelligence.thtml"&gt;Ken Miller says Intelligent Design is nothing but creationism relabeled&lt;/a&gt;. Miller is right, Phillips is once again &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/keep_your_prayers_to_yourself.php"&gt;raving&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/08/what_a_strange_argument.php"&gt;ignorance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an item on the growing popularity of Intelligent Design, John Humphrys interviewed Professor Ken Miller of Brown University in the US who spoke on the subject last evening at the Faraday Institute, Cambridge. Humphrys suggested that Intelligent Design might be considered a kind of middle ground between Darwinism and Creationism. Miller agreed but went further, saying that Intelligent Design was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;nothing more than an attempt to repackage good old-fashioned Creationism and make it more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is totally untrue. Miller referred to a landmark US court case in 2005, &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District&lt;/i&gt;, which did indeed uphold the argument that Intelligent Design was a form of Creationism in its ruling that teaching Intelligent Design violated the constitutional ban against teaching religion in public schools. But the court was simply wrong, doubtless because it had heard muddled testimony from the likes of Prof Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the court testimony was crystal clear, and it wasn&amp;#39;t just Miller who demonstrated the fact that Intelligent Design was a false front laid over old-school creationism. The lawyers demonstrated, among other things, that a) the textbook in question had been crudely revamped from a creationist text by simply substituting &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; (with revealing errors — anyone remember &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html"&gt;cdesign proponentsists&lt;/a&gt;"?); b) that the books were bought with money collected by a conservative church, and that the defendants lied about the source; c) that the people who tried to introduce ID into the Dover schools were motivated entirely by their religious goals (&lt;a href="http://www.twopercentco.com/rants/archives/popups/popup_232.html"&gt;Bill Buckingham to the school board&lt;/a&gt;: "Nearly 2,000 years ago someone died on a cross for us; shouldn't we have the courage to stand up for him?"); and d), that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/bill_buckinghams_dover_testimo.php"&gt;the instigators didn't have the slightest clue what ID was&lt;/a&gt;. We can also go directly to the words of the big names in ID, like Bill Dembski ("&lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/William_Dembski"&gt;Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory&lt;/a&gt;") or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson"&gt;Phillip Johnson&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have built an intellectual movement in the universities and churches that we call The Wedge, which is devoted to scholarship and writing that furthers this program of questioning the materialistic basis of science...Now, the way that I see the logic of our movement going is like this. The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth?...I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the Word. In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right. And the materialist scientists are deluding themselves...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In summary, we have to educate our young people; we have to give them the armor they need. We have to think about how we're going on the offensive rather than staying on the defensive. And above all, we have to come out to the culture with the view that we are the ones who really stand for freedom of thought. You see, we don't have to fear freedom of thought because good thinking done in the right way will eventually lead back to the Church, to the truth-the truth that sets people free, even if it goes through a couple of detours on the way. And so we're the ones that stand for good science, objective reasoning, assumptions on the table, a high level of education, and freedom of conscience to think as we are capable of thinking. That's what America stands for, and that's something we stand for, and that's something the Christian Church and the Christian Gospel stand for-the truth that makes you free. Let's recapture that, while we're recapturing America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or how about &lt;a href="http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/ratzsch.htm"&gt;this from Johnson&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I speak of "theistic realism" -- or sometimes, "mere creation" --as the defining concept of our movement. This means that we affirm that God is objectively real as Creator, and that the reality of God is tangibly recorded in evidence accessible to science, particularly in biology. We avoid the tangled arguments about how or whether to reconcile the Biblical account with the present state of scientific knowledge, because we think these issues can be much more constructively engaged when we have a scientific picture that is not distorted by naturalistic prejudice. If life is not simply matter evolving by natural selection, but is something that had to be designed by a creator who is real, then the nature of that creator, and the possibility of revelation, will become a matter of widespread interest among thoughtful people who are currently being taught that evolutionary science has show God to be a product of the human imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent Design creationism is all about hiding Jesus under a blanket of pseudoscience and smuggling him into the public schools. Nothing more, nothing less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melanie Phillips clearly knows nothing about the case. So what possible reason could she have for claiming ID is distinct from creationism?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the ramifications of the specific school textbooks under scrutiny in the Kitzmiller/Dover case, the fact is that Intelligent Design not only does not come out of Creationism but stands against it. This is because Creationism comes out of religion while Intelligent Design comes out of science. Creationism, whose proponents are Bible literalists, is a specific doctrine which holds that the earth was literally created in six days. Intelligent Design, whose proponents are mainly scientists, holds that the complexity of science suggests that there must have been a governing intelligence behind the origin of matter, which could not have developed spontaneously from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent Design creationism does not come out of science. The initial founders of the Discovery Institute were lawyers, philosophers, venture capitalists, businessmen, and theologians, with a scarce few recruits who were once scientists, like Michael Behe. Science emerges from evidence, not ideology, and these gomers had none, and still have none. They have a &lt;i&gt;claim&lt;/i&gt; that there is a &amp;quot;governing intelligence&amp;quot;, but have shown no evidence for such a being, nor have they even speculated openly about the nature of that intelligence…because when they do, they have to admit that they believe it was the Christian god. Again, without supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Miller is completely correct to say Intelligent Design creationism is "an attempt to repackage good old-fashioned Creationism and make it more palatable". Overt admission that their ideas are based on religion means they are non-scientific, and gets them excluded from science classes. By lying and concealing their motives, they hope to sneak it in past people who are too stupid to recognize the obvious, or who share similar underhanded motives for denying the truth. I wonder which of those two alternatives best fit Melanie Phillips?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/intelligent_design_is_warmed-o.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Mf16oYJoYuQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241110470281"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/direct_action_adapt_at_the_white_house_tony_attwood_update">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb1e013c08c302e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Direct Action: ADAPT at the White House, Tony Attwood Update</title><published>2009-04-30T16:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T16:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/direct_action_adapt_at_the_white_house_tony_attwood_update" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Ed. Two guests today, here's the first--]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2009/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html"&gt;&lt;img title="Blogging Against Disablism Day, May 1st 2009" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aQ1h56WoARI/RiR-V4_3yrI/AAAAAAAAAFw/F-efgSUbcM0/s320/bad02.gif" border="0" alt="Blogging Against Disablism Day, May 1st 2009" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Throughout the history of civil rights movements, direct action such as a street protest or sit-in has been widely used to draw public attention to injustice and the failure to correct it.  A century before ADAPT members chained themselves to the White House fence demanding that President Obama keep his campaign promise to quickly pass the Community Choice Act, suffragists did the same as part of their efforts to gain voting rights for women.  Labor organizers walked the picket lines and, in the early days of unions, often were beaten by police and by management's hired thugs.  Black civil rights activists marched for equality and sat defiantly in the front of the bus, knowing that they were likely to be jailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these struggles were criticized at one time or another for being overly dramatic and going too far.  Protesters often were told that they should just be more patient and wait for gradual changes to take place, instead of being so confrontational.  The same argument sometimes is made today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the critics overlook, however, is that by the time activists engage in direct action, their attempts to discuss the issues politely and quietly have already been ignored for a very long time.  Disability rights advocates have been trying to pass the Community Choice Act, or similar legislation, for the past 40 years.  Their efforts have gotten nowhere because politicians did not expect any consequences for their failure to treat disability rights as a priority issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's recent decision to take direct action against professionals who associate with dangerous hate groups was taken only after many years of our community's concerns being ignored.  Waiting for gradual change has not gotten us anywhere.  The hate groups have only grown bolder in their attempts to incite prejudice and discrimination in family law and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in a protest on April 24th at a presentation by Dr. Tony Attwood, leaflets were handed out explaining the damage done by hate groups such as FAAAS and the ongoing campaign to put an end to it.  Similar protests at future events will continue until Dr. Attwood publicly withdraws his support for hate groups and apologizes for the harm done to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't help but be amazed how our initial description has held up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, throughout the article, it's wonderful how wihtout realizing it, Morano exposes the the fact he's living in a bizarre fantasy world.  Starting with the questionable reality of his confrontation with Al Gore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, Mr. Morano said he once spotted former Vice President Al Gore on an airplane returning from a climate conference in Bali. Mr. Gore was posing for photos with well-wishers, and Mr. Morano said he had asked if he, too, could have his picture taken with Mr. Gore.

&lt;p&gt;He refused, Mr. Morano said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You attack me all the time," Mr. Gore said, according to Mr. Morano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yes, we do," Mr. Morano said he had replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gore's office said Mr. Gore had no memory of the encounter. Mr. Morano does not care. He tells the story anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then his pride over being a swift-boater:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He then jumped to Cybercast News Service, where he was the first to publish accusations from Vietnam Swift-boat veterans that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, then the Democratic presidential nominee, had glorified his war record. Many of the accusations later proved unfounded.

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Morano is proud of his work, which he says is not advocacy but truth seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the bizarre way he justifies including scientists who completely disagree with his position on his BS AGW dissenter list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Kevin Grandia, who manages Desmogblog.com, which describes itself as dedicated to combating misinformation on climate change, says the report is filled with so-called experts who are really weather broadcasters and others without advanced degrees.

&lt;p&gt;Chris Allen, for example, the weather director for WBKO-TV in Kentucky, is listed as a meteorologist on the report, even though he has no degree in meteorology. On his Web site, Mr. Allen has written that his major objection to the idea of human-influenced climate change is that "it completely takes God out of the picture." Mr. Allen did not respond to phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Grandia also said Mr. Morano's report misrepresented the work of legitimate scientists. Mr. Grandia pointed to Steve Rayner, a professor at Oxford, who was mentioned for articles criticizing the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international treaty on curbing carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rayner, however, in no way disputes the existence of global warming or that human activity contributes to it, as the report implies. In e-mail messages, he said that he had asked to be removed from the Morano report and that a staff member in Mr. Inhofe's office had promised that he would be. He called his inclusion on the list "quite outrageous."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about Dr. Rayner, Mr. Morano was unmoved. He said that he had no record of Dr. Rayner's asking to be removed from the list and that the doctor must be "not to be remembering this clearly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, clearly, Dr. Rayner must not be remembering how he never said anything in support of the denialist position on warming.  Only Marc Morano is ever correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's amazing to me how people who are so clearly cranks can remain so influential, especially on a topic as important as global warming.  We clearly have more work to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/04/happy_blogiversary_to_us.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/Ob0knOwDieo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241106215150"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/317d4857ff7a57bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Chiropractic’s Answer to Swine Flu: Get Adjusted!</title><published>2009-04-30T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/538-chiropractics-answer-to-swine-flu-get-adjusted.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="pig" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/pig.jpg" height="169" width="228"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Chiropractors are already capitalizing  on people’s swine flu fears.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Build your immune system by    getting adjusted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Limit the amount of sugar    in your diet because sugar depresses the immune system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Avoid alcohol and white flour    products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Drink more water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Wash your hands frequently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Disinfect your rooms by spraying    them with a solution of essential oils (4 drops to one cup of water). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Read it, I got a chuckle…but one of the panels listing factors in our loss of indie cred says, &amp;quot;We have our own Jonas Brothers.&amp;quot; Now I&amp;#39;m stuck. I can&amp;#39;t figure out who our equivalent would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;#39;t know, the Jonas Brothers are a band that plays a kind of Christian pop — they&amp;#39;re on the Disney Channel and appeal to prepubescent girls like David Cassidy did to my generation, only they are even more wholesome and extremely overt in their religiosity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pondering this, and can't even imagine a proudly atheist band that plays bubblegum for kiddies, or has a show that sucks in adolescent eyeballs quite like the Jonas Brothers do. Maybe the cartoon is wrong. Maybe we aren't quite that mainstream yet. Or maybe I'm just so out of it I've missed the latest godless sensation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/our_own_jonas_brothers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/iwGo9-UYy_Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241105444128"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/mental-conditioning-for-self-defense-brilliantercom.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a84b18d0d3a14afa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">Mental Conditioning for Self Defense | Brillianter.com</title><published>2009-04-30T15:20:14Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T15:20:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/mental-conditioning-for-self-defense-brilliantercom.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="Mental Conditioning for Self Defense | Brillianter.com" href="http://brillianter.com/2009/04/mental-conditioning-for-self-defense/"&gt;Mental Conditioning for Self Defense | Brillianter.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There aren’t any rules. People are hampered in real self defense scenarios by the rules we normally live by. They don’t realize that all doors marked ‘employees only’ are now available for their use. They don’t see the sidewalk as drivable terrain, or that stoplights are simply suggestions in an emergency. They are conditioned by the rules that we live under to a point of mental paralysis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241105444128"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/dutchs-laws-of-just-about-everything-you-have-no-right-to-an-uninformed-opinion.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e3c3cd249fbd9b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">Dutch’s Laws of Just About Everything: You have no right to an uninformed opinion</title><published>2009-04-30T15:19:23Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T15:19:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/dutchs-laws-of-just-about-everything-you-have-no-right-to-an-uninformed-opinion.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="Dutch’s Laws of Just About Everything" href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/dutchrules.htm"&gt;Dutch’s Laws of Just About Everything&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no right to an uninformed opinion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Patriotism is not the last refuge of the scoundrel. &amp;quot;I have a right to my opinion&amp;quot; is. It&amp;#39;s amazing how often people, backed into a corner by logic or evidence, will resort to &amp;quot;I have a right to my opinion,&amp;quot; asserting their right to cling to their opinion despite the evidence.

You have no right to an uninformed opinion. If you are going to hold an opinion on an issue, you have a moral obligation to make it an informed opinion. You have no right to go into a voting booth armed with half-baked, unsupported opinions. I&amp;#39;d love to see literacy tests come back - tough ones. The best idea I ever heard was that voters should have to recite the Bill of Rights verbatim before being allowed to vote. Failing that, we could attach a ten-question multiple choice exam to each ballot. Votes would be weighted by percent correct. With electronic voting, we could scramble the questions to prevent cheating. Certainly if you&amp;#39;re too dumb or slack to follow an arrow from the candidate&amp;#39;s name to the correct punch hole, or make sure the ballot is correctly done, you have no right to complain about the outcome.

Think about it. Would campaign finance reform be necessary if people only held informed opinions? How could any amount of money make a bad idea good? Money isn&amp;#39;t the problem; superficial, uninformed, lazy people are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241105444127"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/a-classroom-teacher-on-grading-behavior.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2a53b4ae4f953f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><title type="html">A Classroom Teacher on Grading Behavior</title><published>2009-04-30T14:51:08Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T14:51:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/a-classroom-teacher-on-grading-behavior.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="A Shrewdness of Apes: More on the grading controversy" href="http://shrewdnessofapes.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-on-grading-controversy.html"&gt;A Shrewdness of Apes: More on the grading controversy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;the philosophical point of Mr. O'Connor's system (as presented to us), it was exclaimed repeatedly that BEHAVIORS should not be represented in grades. I find this to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what education is. A real education, which is the one that students all ultimately craft for themselves for good or for ill, is based completely upon the way in which they choose to behave, to change or not change the way that they act and interact with knowledge, skills, and opportunities that are presented to them. This is what cognitive theory is all about, and it is much neglected in an era in which it is assumed that if a student fails to achieve mastery, it is always due to some external factor. Learning is an individual process in the end. That's not a cop-out, nor is it meant to negate the very real impact that instructors, school, community,or parents can have. But the ultimate determiner of success in education is the student and his or her attitude or behavior, if you will.

They all have facebook fan pages…created by the Institute for Creation Research!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carver is representative: here's the kind of thing the ICR writes about each one, and is the actual reason they've created these fan pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Washington Carver was one of the great scientists who honored God as the Creator. Carver revolutionized agricultural science, and his studies of nature convinced him of the existence and benevolence of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t give a damn about the science — all that matters is that they were creationists. It seems a rather dishonorable reason to honor people known for their scientific works. It&amp;#39;s also absurd, in that all but Carver lived and worked before Darwin … heck, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; would have been a creationist if I'd been a 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century scientist, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the list, though, there's a significant omission. Where's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Agassiz"&gt;Louis Agassiz&lt;/a&gt;? You&amp;#39;d be hard pressed to find a more vehement opponent of Charles Darwin who was also a contemporary and a renowned scientist…you&amp;#39;d think they&amp;#39;d rush to embrace him. He was also such a friend to the southern conservatives who wanted a scientific argument to support slavery…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to put this into context, we need some background. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not a single discrete pathophysiological disease. In fact, the term “disease” is probably not appropriate at all, which is why it is termed a “disorder.” Like many neurological conditions with primarily cognitive and behavior effects, ASD likely correlates with the organization and function of neurons in the brain - not a pathological disease process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that there is likely to be a complex set of many factors that contribute to ASD - not one single cause. ASD is defined by the clinical symptoms that are evident - decreased social and verbal skills with a tendency to display repetitive behaviors or a narrow focus of interest. Brain function itself is highly complex, and these higher-order behaviors may just be the final common pathway of many potential underlying changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same exact situation is true for other entities, like schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder (ADD). These syndromes are defined by clinical features, they represent a varied set of disorders with complex underlying causes. One difference, however, is that schizophrenia and ADD likely represent changes to particular parts of the brain, while autism is likely due to changes in the global architecture of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all this means is that the genetics of autism is likely to be a complex puzzle, and so far that is what researchers are finding. ASD is not a genetic disease in the sense that, say, hemophilia is a genetic disease. Over the years, geneticists have identified a long list of simple genetic diseases - where a single mutation in a single gene causes disruption in the function of a single protein.  This class of genetic disorders is directly inherited, with various known patterns (autosomal vs X or Y linked or mitochondrial, and dominant vs recessive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate class of genetic disorders is not directly inherited but for which there is a genetic predisposition. In these entities, certain genetic variants convey an increased risk of developing a disease or disorder, but it does not directly cause them.  ASD falls into this broad category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a particular gene variant predispose to a disorder without “causing” it? There are two primary hypotheses to answer this question. The first is that one gene variant is not sufficient to cause a disease, but must be combined with other gene variants. Therefore, a person can have any of the gene variants that predispose to the disorder without having the disorder. No single implicated gene variant will correlate 100% with the disorder in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these disorders predisposing gene variants are like a giant puzzle, but one that has many potential solutions. Perhaps there is a critical threshold - an individual will need to have a certain critical number of the predisposing variants, but in any combination, in order to manifest the disorder. This situation likely results from each variant decrease some physiological function by a small amount, but the cumulative effect of many variants impairs the function significantly enough to cause clinical manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second way in which a genetic variant predisposes to without directly causing a disease or disorder is if there needs to be an environmental trigger. Perhaps the genetic variant only manifests if there is a particular environment in the womb. Some diseases, like multiple sclerosis, are now thought to be triggered, for example, by certain kinds of viral infections. Or a genetic variant may leave an individual more susceptible to a specific toxin or other environment stressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the interplay of environment and genetics is likely critical to the understanding of most genetic conditions, even the more direct genetic diseases. Genetics is only one factor in determining development. The environment of the womb (exposures to varying levels of maternal hormones, for example) is also critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the genetics of autism, current models are therefore consistent with what is being found when the genetics of autism is researched - researchers are finding many genes that predispose to autism in a subset of cases but no single or simple universal cause. At present, 133 different gene variants have been linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new research, conducted by Dr. Hakon Hakonarson of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is a genome wide analysis involving about 10,000 individuals. This is a relatively new technique made possible by advances in computer technology and rapid DNA sequencing. They can compare genes across the entire genome among thousands of individuals and look for statistical patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a powerful technique, it is primarily a process of data mining for correlations. By itself this type of data cannot answer questions - but it can point us in the direction of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.autismconnect.org/news.asp?section=00010001&amp;amp;itemtype=news&amp;amp;id=6508"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has found a robust link between autism and six such variants. These do not invariably cause the condition, but they are about 20 per cent more common in children with autism than they are in those who are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are especially significant because the variants lie between two genes, called CDH9 and CDH10, which are known to play an important role in forming nerve connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the last bit that makes these findings so interesting - more than a statistical fluke.  The gene variants that correlated with ASD are for proteins that are involved in the process of neurons forming connections with each other. There is already other lines of evidence that suggest what is different in ASD brains is a decrease in the amount of interconnectedness and communication among neurons. It is therefore likely no coincidence that this study found genetic correlations for proteins involved with neuronal connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also is compatible with the finding that many separate genes are potentially involved with ASD - for there are many separate genes and processes involved with forming and maintaining neuronal connections. Perhaps each variant associated with ASD, by itself, does not result in any significant difference in the ability of neurons to connect to each other. But when a sufficient number of variants are present, with the proper environmental factors, neuronal connections are decreased resulting in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in this area are being properly cautious about the interpretation of this latest research. This is a significant finding, which strengthens the evidence for an important genetic role in ASD and advances our understanding of the ultimate causes of ASD. This, of course, creates the potential for biological interventions, although it is always difficult to predict the outcomes of translational research (developing clinical applications from basic science).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism researcher, Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, summed up the current situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for future research will be to establish which of these findings can be well-replicated in independent samples and by independent labs; what the functions of these genes are and where they are expressed; which aspects of the phenotype of autism they can explain; whether they relate to one sub-group or the whole autism spectrum; how many of these genes are necessary and sufficient to cause autism; and how they may interact with environmental factors. The puzzle is slowly being pieced together, and the science of autism is accelerating in promising ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best research not only leads to answers, but more questions.  There are many questions to be researched in follow up to these current findings. But a picture of what is likely going on in ASD is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further - this study shows how the technology of genetic research is accelerating. This is one avenue of research that is very information intensive and is yielding to the law of accelerating returns. As computer and sequencing technology continues to improve, our ability to rapidly gather data about the genome and its relationship to clinical entities is improving and accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While I was reading up on the subject, I was seized with fear about what the research said. Foetuses, infants and toddlers are basically unable to metabolise toxins the way that adults are and we are constantly filling our environments with chemicals that may or may not be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research is troubling; the incidence of diseases in children such as asthma, cancer and autism have shot up exponentially and many children we all know and love have been diagnosed with developmental issues like ADHD [Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, she went on to point the finger at shampoo as a potential major problem in our society and raised a possible link between shampoo and childhood cancers.  Now, I am not sure how one can use shampoo on the head of a foetus (or a fetus, for that matter), but we have to tip our hat to celebrities for bringing such associations to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did a bit of science myself to assess the voracity of her claims.  I too was seized with fear when I noted the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the kids in my practice who have ADHD have used shampoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the kids with cancer have also used shampoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used shampoo as a kid (but not as a fetus), and I have ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projection is that 100% of the people now using shampoo will die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really backs up my misgivings about shampoo.  I have always wondered at the claims these so-called hair-care products make so boldly.  Here are some examples of lies spread by the shampoo industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarifying&lt;/em&gt; shampoo - What are they claiming with this?  Is there such thing as unclear hair?  Do some people look as though they have a giant blob of hair-like substance on their head instead of many separate hairs?  Does  clarifying shampoo make each individual hair once again visible on these people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pH Balanced - &lt;/em&gt;What is pH imbalance?  Is it when the pH sometimes is so acidic that it burns your hair off?  That would be terrifying if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://distractible.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/comboverbmp.jpg" title="comboverbmp" alt="comboverbmp" height="167" width="158"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volumizing&lt;/em&gt; shampoo - I was not aware &lt;em&gt;volumizing&lt;/em&gt; was a word (nor was my spell-check).  This means that the shampoo volumes things.  How can you volume something?  Does each hair get a separate volume, or does the hair suddenly get very loud.  Personally, I am afraid to open the bottles of these shampoos for fear of going deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://distractible.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bad-hair-day-indeed-231x300.jpg" style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px" title="bad-hair-day-indeed" alt="bad-hair-day-indeed" height="159" width="122"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shampoo for &lt;em&gt;stressed hair -&lt;/em&gt; I have never thought about the emotional state of my hair.  I was not aware that it worries about things.  Perhaps it worries about being volumized or burned by non-pH balanced shampoos.  Perhaps it worries about being put on a foetus.  Does this type of shampoo contain a hair version of valium?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Vitalizing&lt;/em&gt; shampoo - At least &lt;em&gt;vitalizing &lt;/em&gt;is actually a word, but would you really want vitalized hair?  My dictionary defines this as “giving life and energy to.”  Hair is dead, as we all know.  Does this “hair resurrection” cause your hair to scream every time it is brushed or cut?  Does it move about on your head independently?  What if it decides it wants to become a mullet?? Thank you, but I prefer my hair dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://distractible.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/post-a1324-bad-hair1-240x300.jpg" style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px" title="post-a1324-bad-hair1" alt="post-a1324-bad-hair1" height="163" width="131"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-adjusting &lt;/em&gt;shampoo - Instead of the hair having independent action, this type of shampoo seems to have an intelligence of its own.  How would it self-adjust?  Does it have a computer chip embedded in it or does it somehow have sentience?  How do we know if it will adjust in a way we want?  It could adjust to pH imbalance or de-volumization, couldn’t it?  What if this self-adjusting shampoo, which clearly has some degree of autonomy, gets ideas and causes other shampoos to break the shackles we humans put on it and forms a shampoo revolution?  An even scarier thought is if a self-adjusting shampoo comes in contact with vitalized hair!  What will happen then?  Will they fight, or will they conspire against the shampooee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby &lt;/em&gt;shampoo - What is the life-cycle of a shampoo?  How do they find these baby shampoos and why would they steal them from their parents?  This is probably what is causing the shampoos to become self-adjusting.  I will say, shampoos do seem to multiply in our bathroom.  We probably have 16 bottles of different kinds of shampoo in our shower right now.  I just recently noticed some baby shampoo, but I thought my wife had just bought it.  I see now that we should not let the bottles touch each other if we want to have room in our shower to bathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you see, while Miss Paltrow’s fears about shampoo are clearly far short of the whole story, at least they bring attention to this frightening situation.  Shampoo manufacturers are clearly in cahoots and have eyes on world domination.  The condemnation of this celebrity’s claims by “scientists” are clearly a smoke-screen to keep us from noticing the obvious plans for the destruction of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more shampoo for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta go now.  It’s time for my colon cleanse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for continually blogging about the pseudoscience at &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Of late, it seems that I can't go more than a day or two without some new atrocity against science being tossed out from Arianna's happy home for antivaccinationists and quacks. Be it antivaccine lunacy, Deepak Chopra's "quantum" woo, or the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;latest quack stylings of Kim Evans&lt;/a&gt;, no woo is too woo-ey, no quackery too quacky, no pseudoscience too far out for HuffPo. In any case, HuffPo is a lot like blogging about the antivaccine movement. As I've characterized it again and again, it's just like what Michael Corleone said in that weakest of the &lt;em&gt;Godfather&lt;/em&gt; movies, &lt;em&gt;The Godfather, Part III&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UPw-3e_pzqU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. I've been pulled back in again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? What's done it? You'll see. It's a post by someone named Matthew Stein entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-stein/when-a-super-bug-strikes_b_192543.html"&gt;When a Superbug Strikes Close to Home, How Will You Deal With it?&lt;/a&gt; (also published in a patently unreadable form on &lt;a href="http://www.whentechfails.com/node/1447"&gt;Stein's own website&lt;/a&gt;). Between the fear mongering and the advocacy of quackery, it seems to me that Kim Evans had better watch her back. There's a new woo-meister in town at HuffPo, and he can match her woo for woo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_quackery_at_huffpo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/5gDDF2mNCuc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241096469331"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/say_ireland_you_might_want_to.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/18b5f5f60069a6c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Say, Ireland, you might want to pay more attention to this blasphemy law</title><published>2009-04-30T13:45:55Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T13:45:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/YhNOfZPWoAU/say_ireland_you_might_want_to.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/say_ireland_you_might_want_to.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It looks like trouble, and &lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ahern-defends-new-blasphemy-law-1724069.html"&gt;some ministers are defending the proposed blasphemy law&lt;/a&gt; — you people aren&amp;#39;t going to let this violation of civil rights &lt;i&gt;pass&lt;/i&gt;, are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some more details on the law, too: it authorizes fines up to €100,000, and gives the police the right to seize blasphemous materials from your home. If you&amp;#39;re reading Pharyngula right now on your home computer, you may have broken that law, and they can come take your computer away…and then they&amp;#39;ll notice all those books by Hitchens and Harris and Dawkins and so forth on your bookshelves, and next thing you know, you&amp;#39;re locked up in the Catholic Prison, stamping out communion wafers for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are the other implications. The Scientologists must be rubbing their hands with glee: their outrage will be sufficient to &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0430/1224245681506.html"&gt;arrest people who protest their cult&lt;/a&gt;. If you draw a doodle that looks vaguely like Mohammed, and some nearby Moslem is outraged, you are &lt;i&gt;guilty, guilty, guilty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the Milky Way, called that because it looks like milk has spilled across the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you look at it through a telescope, it resolves itself into millions upon millions of stars. Faint and tightly packed, they merge together, forming a fuzzy streak because we lack the resolution in our eyes to separate out the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true when you look at the sky in X-rays. A pervasive X-ray glow permeates the same area of the sky as the Milky Way, and for many years astronomers haven’t known if this is due to a vast ribbon of million-degree hot gas and is truly a fuzzy glow, or if it’s caused by lots and lots of point sources packed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA’s orbiting Chandra X-ray observatory has finally resolved (haha! I kill me) the issue. Behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/gridge/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3630/3487099229_2de85a7baa_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image shown is a Spitzer infrared image of a region very near the center of the Milky Way. Chandra stared at the indicated spot for roughly &lt;em&gt;250 hours&lt;/em&gt; (!) — one of the deepest exposures ever taken using the observatory —  and instead of a faint, diffuse glow it found hundreds of faint point sources of X-rays. This strongly indicates that the glow in X-rays seen by earlier telescopes is in fact the combined glow of millions of such discrete sources!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news; it hardly seemed possible that there was a source of energy that could keep so much gas heated to millions of degrees. But now we have another question: what the heck are the point sources? Most likely they’re white dwarfs, stars like the Sun whose lives are over, and all that’s left is the hot, dense core. If a white dwarf is in a tight orbit around a normal star, it can draw material off that star. This matter piles up on the dwarf and gets very hot, emitting X-rays. It can also build up to a critical point and undergo massive spontaneous fusion, again blasting out X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are most likely other sources of X-rays in there as well, including highly magnetic binary stars, neutron stars, and black holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this observation. It’s everything science should be: an interesting question, a straightforward observation to determine the solution, a willingness on the part of the observatory directors to take a lot of precious telescope time to make the observation, and a result that is so clean it’s pretty easy to interpret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only all things in science were like this. But of course, sometimes the fun is at the edges, where observations are tricky, the physics uncertain, and the results surprising and leading to new vistas to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple and clean, or difficult and fuzzy: science has room for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;UC Riverside biologists researching the behavior of field crickets have found for the first time that female crickets remember attractive males based on the latter's song, and use this information when choosing mates. The researchers found that female crickets compare the information about the attractiveness of available males around them with other incoming signals when selecting attractive males for mating.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A group of scientists at The Scripps Research Institute has set up the microscopic equivalent of the Galapagos Islands--an artificial ecosystem inside a test tube where molecules evolve to exploit distinct ecological niches, similar to the finches that Charles Darwin famously described in "The Origin of Species" 150 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090428092823.htm" title=""&gt;Evidence Of The 'Lost World': Did Dinosaurs Survive The End Cretaceous Extinctions?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Lost World, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's account of an isolated community of dinosaurs that survived the catastrophic extinction event 65 million years ago, has no less appeal now than it did when it was written a century ago. Various Hollywood versions have tried to recreate the lost world of dinosaurs, but today the fiction seems just a little closer to reality. New scientific evidence suggests that dinosaur bones from the Ojo Alamo Sandstone in the San Juan Basin, USA, date from after the extinction, and that dinosaurs may have survived in a remote area of what is now New Mexico and Colorado for up to half a million years. This controversial new research, published today in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica, is based on detailed chemical investigations of the dinosaur bones, and evidence for the age of the rocks in which they are found.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_665.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/jJtgoa_HpLE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241093794033"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2244">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c20e5d61cef4793</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Two new genetic studies - care required</title><published>2009-04-30T09:33:39Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T09:33:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/RbB4oSMZ1vQ/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241092373374"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/postrank.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0fcfcfd609f41fc7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">PostRank</title><published>2009-04-30T11:06:57Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T11:06:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/wFcbA59zhGY/postrank.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/postrank.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm trying out a new side-bar widget from &lt;a href="http://www.postrank.com/publishers"&gt;PostRank&lt;/a&gt;.

But even there, insects do exist!&lt;a href="http://tolweb.org/Echinophthiriidae/13661"&gt;&lt;img title="lepidophthirusmacrorhini" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/lepidophthirusmacrorhini.jpg?w=239&amp;amp;h=274" alt="lepidophthirusmacrorhini" width="239" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entire &lt;a href="http://tolweb.org/Echinophthiriidae/13661"&gt;family of lice&lt;/a&gt; specializes just on carnivorous pinnipeds, (seals, walrus, and sea lions).  It’s called &lt;strong&gt;Echinophthiriidae&lt;/strong&gt;, and I had to memorize that name when I was in my first graduate entomology course.  And, spell it correctly to get full credit on the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Why yes, 20 years later, I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; still a little bitter about that. On the other hand, at important cocktail parties, I always know how to start a conversation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seal louse has the wonderful species name &lt;em&gt;Echinophthirius horridus; &lt;/em&gt;another genus is called &lt;em&gt;Antarctophthirus. &lt;/em&gt;Like other sucking lice, they inject a little mouthtube into their host and suck their blood.  They only feed on land; in the water they just hang on with their claws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lice in this family of insects have several special &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/vrbqkb8p4lvlbnqh/"&gt;modifications from regular lice&lt;/a&gt;; their cuticle (waxy covering of the exoskeleton) is thicker, it traps seal sebum (body oils), and also &lt;a title="neato photo" href="http://tolweb.org/onlinecontributors/app?page=ViewImageData&amp;amp;service=external&amp;amp;sp=14458"&gt;forms scales&lt;/a&gt; which create a pocket of air under the oil and water for the insect to breathe while the seal is swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How common are they? A &lt;a title="PDF" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/vrbqkb8p4lvlbnqh/"&gt;1972 study&lt;/a&gt; found about 75% of Northern Fur Seals had lice, and many had more than one species of seal louse.  Perhaps not surprisingly, I didn’t find a more recent study in which someone closely examined 75+ seals for lice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is a publication out there waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe things do get better sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the news of late (especially given the "current economic climate") hasn't exactly been upbeat. And certainly when it comes to understanding about autism, and the kinds of education, services and supports that would truly help individuals on the spectrum, more than a few of us seem weary of the numerous calls (especially this past "Autism Awareness Month") for "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/yes_theres_awareness---but_has_there_been_change"&gt;more autism awareness&lt;/a&gt;"---what good is "awareness" without &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/yes_theres_awareness---but_has_there_been_change"&gt;real change&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some things have gotten better, albeit in small and not-so-noticeable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take shoe-tying. I'd always thought this was one of those milestones of childhood development, independence, etc., etc.. We started trying to teach Charlie when he was 5 and then it was 6 and then we "put that on hold" and then tried again at 8 1/2----around which time I got Jim his first pair of black suede slip-on shoes, and realized that I myself prefer shoes you can just shove your feet into and run out the door with. My parents diligently went to the kids' section of a department store and came back with, voilà, black suede Merrell shoes in size whatever Charlie was wearing then (his feet were still smaller than mine then, but fast gaining). Suddenly getting out the door was rendered a couple-fold easer, as Charlie had only to slip his feet into his shoes and go. And here was his Dad doing it too (ok, I still allow the occasional buckle on one of my shoes but no laces, except on my running shoes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've gotten sneaks for Charlie for gym and our various forays into sports (like Special Olympics basketball) but the general consensus has been, the black shoes are fine. Charlie has certainly done his best to pull the shoelaces on a practice shoe straight and he's very patient having his shoes laced and tied onto his feet. But he always got stuck when it was to try to thread one lace through the other to make a knot and it was generally agreed, better to spend time on other things and the black shoes were fine for gym. (They certainly work well for bike riding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's simple things like those black shoes that have made things easier for Charlie and have made it possible for him to be less reliant on us. I've long been thankful for the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/ode-to-polarfleece/"&gt;invention of polar fleece&lt;/a&gt;, both for its comforting properties (as blankets, jackets, gloves, hats, you name it) and who says pants have to have buttons and zippers and that you have to wear belts? Charlie's fingers are long and lithe and can move around the piano keys, but grasping pencils and fastening buttons: Not his forte.  Sure I wish he could write all of his letters so that they're legible, but being able to type (something that's still on the list of things to learn) can enable him to get his point across, without having to worry about penmanship. Why not embrace and put to good use the innovations that have been created, so that Charlie can have more chances to handle things by himself, than he might have in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is the squishy ball made of mushable, gooey-soft plastic. I first ordered a bunch of colorful inside-out squishy balls for Charlie to busy his fidgety fingers with from a catalogue of products for special needs kids. Next year, those inside-out balls were all the rage in toy stores and, eventually in Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider this &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3127531998/"&gt;blue bookbag&lt;/a&gt; I got Charlie for use in school this year. It doesn't have all the compartments, zippers, mesh pockets, embellishments, patches, of the typical middle-schooler backpack these days. Maybe those are the right choice for some kids, but Charlie pretty much ignores all the extras and just sticks stuff into the one main pouch (which, in his bag, is nice and roomy). It's happened that he's almost taken home another's chid's lunchbox or backpack (Charlie has an &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3159816717/"&gt;old beat-up blue one&lt;/a&gt;, which he still keeps around for security)---no one else has a bag like his, so that's impossible. (I mean, what would we do if Charlie came home &lt;em&gt;with the wrong bag&lt;/em&gt;?) (And, his little bag is completely machine washable, has his name imprinted on the cover, and closes with two solid snaps.) (Guess I always have fine motor coordination on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could go on: I'm glad for cotton ripstop pants that are light and loose for Charlie to wear; it's always hit or miss if he'll let us know that he doesn't like the feel of his clothes. I'm ridiculously grateful for the microwave oven and (oh yes) frozen food, as these have provided Charlie with a burgeoning ability to cook food for himself. The list goes on: child safety locks (yes, we still have them on in the black car, resulting in any backseat passengers always having to wait patiently for Jim and me to let them); cell phones (I figure Charlie will have one some day and we'll be able to know where he is and he'll be able, because I've programmed it into his phone, to call us at a button's push). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora wrote about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessibility_technology_and_universal_design"&gt;accessibility, technology, and universal design&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.... design stuff so everyone can use it. Most of us have experienced the benefits of universal design when we make use of handrails on stair cases, even if we don't have a disability which makes the handrails always necessary......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie, and Jim and me, can accommodate ourselves to walking on ramps and toilets of various heights (hey, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/looking_for_a_few_accommodations_no_matter_what_your_age"&gt;accommodations matter&lt;/a&gt;, and especially in places that we all frequent). We park the black car in whatever place, and see that there are spaces closer to the stores for those who need them. There are some accommodations that Charlie needs, and some not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the April 8th &lt;a href="http://arieff.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/designing-through-a-depression/"&gt;By Design&lt;/a&gt; blog in the &lt;a href="http://arieff.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/designing-through-a-depression/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Allison Arieff writes about &lt;a href="http://arieff.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/designing-through-a-depression/"&gt;Designing Through Depress&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers can work to improve on existing necessities as well as future ones: why, for example, can’t toothbrushes be designed to last longer? When will we see a lamp that casts a truly flattering glow from compact fluorescents ? (Vu1 is just about there, having created an electron stimulated lightbulb that is as efficient as a CFL but is mercury-free.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next quote comes from the last paragraph and yes, I know, mentioning "mercury-free" on an autism blog is like throwing a match into a recycling bin---leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart, design is about problem-solving, but it’s also about problem-identifying. Instead of creating a need for things, designers can now focus on responding to things we do need. We may have never been confronted with as many problems as we are today; the blame for them can’t be attributed to designers, but many future solutions can — and will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Things we do need": Where can I start my list of things that Charlie might need to make it just a bit easier, easeful-er, for him to manage day by day? More light and higher ceilings and something besides those d****d fluorescent lights in his classrooms---a desk and a chair that would fit a boy who is still a boy but just keeps growing into adult size and sizes----other changes in the design of things that make "doing it on his own" a phrase about possibility, rather than frustrating failure again and again.........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our life with Charlie, I'm reminded again and again that the smallest changes, the minutest bits of progress, count as much as gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe even velcro.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241076822271"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3127">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7239793e2bfd1a4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Examiner"/><title type="html">I’m the new NY Atheist and Skeptic Examiner</title><published>2009-04-30T07:33:22Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T07:33:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/im-the-new-ny-atheist-and-skeptic-examiner/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t gotten around to mentioning it on this site yet but as of several days ago, in addition to my regular blog here at Skepacabra, I have become the official NY Atheist and Skeptic Examiner at the &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-9090-NY-Atheist--Skeptic-Examiner"&gt;Examiner.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; There I will be blogging mostly about atheist and skeptical news stories and the NYC atheist/skeptical scene.&lt;br&gt; Most if not all of the posts there will probably be crossovers from some of the material written here on Skepacabra.

Watson, Sr.) running on a supercomputer will be tested to see if it can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it’s capable of pulling contextually correct information from a set database of stored knowledge that it can then phrase into an appropriate response for Jeopardy!. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential breakthrough here isn’t in the program’s ability to think so much as its ability to understand the subtleties of human language. For example, when given the answer “Bordered by Syria and Israel, this small country is only 135 miles long and 35 miles wide”, the program is able to respond with the correct question, “What is Lebanon?”, by contextualizing the information it already has. The Jeopardy! Producers hope to lure back all-time champion Ken Jennings to compete with Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jennings accepts the challenge, it’ll be interesting to see if he becomes this generation’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)"&gt;John Henry&lt;/a&gt; or this generation’s  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov#Chess_against_computers"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; . Or maybe this whole thing will just turn out to be another &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk"&gt;Turk&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess"&gt;computers have a long history of playing chess quite well&lt;/a&gt;. And there are still lots of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Problems_of_AI"&gt;problems scientists must solve before achieving true artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello.  I just thought I'd share this with you.  I've noticed that the egregious Peter Popoff's TV show has been running here in Australia in the middle of the night on the Nine Network for several months.  I decided to see whether I could get them exposed.  I emailed a program called "Media Watch" on the ABC (Aust Broadcasting Corp), telling them about Popoff and his history.  I did get back a response from one of their investigators a few days later, requesting some more info, and he told me they were doing a segment on Popoff on last night's (Monday 27th April) show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to see that the episode did appear last night, and delighted to see that they credited James Randi with originally exposing his fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the episode online if you care to.  Go to (&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2553918.htm"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;) and you can see and/or download the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don't know if my request triggered the report or whether they were planning it anyway, but it doesn't really matter.  Media Watch is a respected prime time program which acts as a sort of unofficial "watchdog" over the Aust media.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Well Ken, we don’t know if you prompted it or not, but thanks very much for not only calling it to the Australian media’s attention, but also to our own.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241069938451"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2eeb1d4dab3609eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Velveeta and Reynolds Wrap Coupons</title><published>2009-04-30T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/velveeta.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Can two Internet-circulated coupons be redeemed for free Velveeta and Reynolds Wrap products?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241069492812"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-66188583">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6aeb6b09cb0c3308</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution / Intelligent Design" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Religious Idiocy" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Melanie Phillips Wrong Again</title><published>2009-04-30T05:05:05Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T13:52:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/04/melanie-phillips-wrong-on-intelligent-design-creationism.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/04/melanie-phillips-wrong-on-intelligent-design-creationism.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most consistently stupid “journalists” writing on the subject of science and intelligent design has to be Melanie Phillips. I commented two years ago on another horrendous anti-science piece of hers: &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/08/idiot-journalis.html"&gt;Idiot Journalist is the new enemy of reason&lt;/a&gt;.  Now she’s back again writing in the &lt;em&gt;Spectator,&lt;/em&gt; with a piece entitled &lt;a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3573761/creating-an-insult-to-intelligence.thtml" rel="nofollow"&gt;Creating An Insult To Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; – actually a highly accurate headline considering what she wrote under it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listening to the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm"&gt;Today programme&lt;/a&gt; this morning, I was irritated once again by yet another misrepresentation of Intelligent Design as a form of Creationism. In an &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8024000/8024302.stm"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; on the growing popularity of Intelligent Design, John Humphrys interviewed Professor Ken Miller of Brown University in the US who spoke on the subject last evening at the Faraday Institute, Cambridge. Humphrys suggested that Intelligent Design might be considered a kind of middle ground between Darwinism and Creationism. Miller agreed but went further, saying that Intelligent Design was&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;nothing more than an attempt to repackage good old-fashioned Creationism and make it more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this is totally untrue. Miller referred to a landmark US court case in 2005, &lt;em&gt;Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District&lt;/em&gt;, which did indeed uphold the argument that Intelligent Design was a form of Creationism in its ruling that teaching Intelligent Design violated the constitutional ban against teaching religion in public schools. But the court was simply wrong, doubtless because it had heard muddled testimony from the likes of Prof Miller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The court was”simply wrong”? What, because you say so? And why was Miller’s testimony “muddled”? Because you didn’t like it? Or because you didn’t understand it? In any case, the court was not “wrong”, simply or otherwise. The court was shown evidence (actually, virtual proof) of the link between creationism and ID. &lt;strong&gt;The transitional version - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=80"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cdesign proponentsists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – was discovered. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put simply, the ID book &lt;em&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/em&gt; that was discussed at the Dover trial was originally a unashamed creation book called &lt;em&gt;Creation Biology&lt;/em&gt;. (You know it’s a creation book because it has the word “Creation” in the title. You’re welcome.) Just after the Supreme Court ruling against creation science in Edwards v. Aguillard, the Disco Tute decided to remake the book as an ID book, rewriting large parts of it to make it all “sciencey” and not creationism at all.  No, really. But unfortunately for them, they were in such a hurry to do so that in changing the wording in one place from “creationists” to (presumably) “intelligent design proponents”, they morphed the two phrases and the book actually included the words “cdesign proponentsists”. Apparently they believe in a designer but not in a spell checker. Hilarious. Click the NCSE’s &lt;a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=80"&gt;Missing Link discovered!&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed explanation of what they did. Also, The Panda&amp;#39;s Thumb&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html"&gt;Missing link: “cdesign proponentsists”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the ramifications of the specific school textbooks under scrutiny in the Kitzmiller/Dover case, the fact is that Intelligent Design not only does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;come out of Creationism but stands against it. This is because Creationism comes out of religion while Intelligent Design comes out of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is funny, because &lt;strike&gt;cdesign proponentsists&lt;/strike&gt; (excuse me) intelligent design proponents don’t do any science. Instead they write long whiney articles about why ID &lt;em&gt;is too&lt;/em&gt; science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Creationism, whose proponents are Bible literalists, is a specific doctrine which holds that the earth was literally created in six days. Intelligent Design, whose proponents are mainly scientists, holds that the complexity of science suggests that there must have been a governing intelligence behind the origin of matter, which could not have developed spontaneously from nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how did the existence of this “governing intelligence” result in there being matter? According to IDists, the designer designed stuff. Stuff that could not have evolved. So after he had designed it, surely he must have implemented his design? But how did he do this, if the “matter […] could not have developed spontaneously from nothing” as Phillips writes? Didn’t the designer have to “create” the matter? If not, where did it come from? And if the designer did create matter, how is this not “creationism”? Obviously it’s not literal six day creationism, but who said creationism had to be literal six day creationism as in Genesis? Regardless of whether ID has its roots in religious creation or not (it does, but even if it didn’t),&lt;strong&gt; it’s still creationism.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly it’s more than just “design” (intelligent or otherwise). Somewhere along the line, the designer had to create stuff too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The confusion arises partly out of ignorance, with people lazily confusing belief in a Creator with Creationism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bit like how people lazily confuse the appearance of design with belief in a designer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But belief in a Creator is common to all people of monotheistic faith – with many scientists amongst them -- the vast majority of whom would regard Creationism as totally ludicrous. In coming to the conclusion that a governing intelligence must have been responsible for the ultimate origin of matter, Intelligent Design proponents are essentially saying there must have been a creator. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There you are - “there must have been a creator”.  Told you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference between them and people of religious faith is that ID proponents do not necessarily believe in a personalised Creator, or God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, yes they do, but even if they didn’t, it’s still creationism. It’s still “magic man did it”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, both Creationists and many others of religious faith disdain Intelligent Design, just as ID proponents think Creationism is totally off the wall. Yet the two continue to be conflated. And ignorance is only partly responsible for the confusion, since militant evangelical atheists deliberately conflate Intelligent Design with Creationism in order to smear and discredit ID and its adherents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, we conflate them because they are the same. If they want it to be science they need to do some science. Then they need to write it up and present it for publication in a science journal. Then have it peer reviewed, and stuff like that. But that’s too hard. Instead they just want to whine about how mean scientists are for calling them creationists. Boo hoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241068654858"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_152.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/359c6c88b2af0a84</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-04-30T04:58:08Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T04:58:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ClZO2SR1tOg/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_152.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_152.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=4&amp;amp;day=30&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;24 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005379" title=""&gt;Can Ethograms Be Automatically Generated Using Body Acceleration Data from Free-Ranging Birds?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, "Ethographer". We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005414" title=""&gt;A Method to Quantify Mouse Coat-Color Proportions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coat-color proportions and patterns in mice are used as assays for many processes such as transgene expression, chimerism, and epigenetics. In many studies, coat-color readouts are estimated from subjective scoring of individual mice. Here we show a method by which mouse coat color is quantified as the proportion of coat shown in one or more digital images. We use the yellow-agouti mouse model of epigenetic variegation to demonstrate this method. We apply this method to live mice using a conventional digital camera for data collection. We use a raster graphics editing program to convert agouti regions of the coat to a standard, uniform, brown color and the yellow regions of the coat to a standard, uniform, yellow color. We use a second program to quantify the proportions of these standard colors. This method provides quantification that relates directly to the visual appearance of the live animal. It also provides an objective analysis with a traceable record, and it should allow for precise comparisons of mouse coats and mouse cohorts within and between studies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And I don't like it one bit. But first, some background, and then we'll get to the censorship stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago I wrote &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001395.html"&gt;a Language Log post entitled "BS conditional semantics and the Pinocchio effect"&lt;/a&gt; about the nonsense spouted by a lie detection company, Nemesysco. I was disturbed by the marketing literature of the company, which suggested a 98% success rate in detecting evil intent of airline passengers, and included crap like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The LVA uses a patented and unique technology to detect "Brain activity finger prints" using the voice as a "medium" to the brain and analyzes the complete emotional structure of your subject. Using wide range spectrum analysis and micro-changes in the speech waveform itself (not micro tremors!) we can learn about any anomaly in the brain activity, and furthermore, classify it accordingly. Stress ("fight or flight" paradigm) is only a small part of this emotional structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 98% figure, as I pointed out, and as Mark Liberman made even clearer &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001396.html"&gt;in a follow up post&lt;/a&gt;, is meaningless. There is no type of lie detector in existence whose performance can reasonably be compared to the performance of finger printing. It is meaningless to talk about someone's "complete emotional structure", and there is no interesting sense in which any current technology can analyze it. It is not the case that looking at speech will provide information about "any anomaly in the brain activity": at most it will tell you about &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; anomalies. Oh, the delicious irony, a lie detector company that engages in wanton deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ok, Nemesysco, as I said in my earlier post, is clearly trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. Disturbing, yes, but it doesn't follow from the fact that its marketing is wildly misleading that the company's technology is of no merit. However, we now know that the company's technology is, in fact, of no merit. How do we know? Because two phoneticians, Anders Eriksson and Francisco Lacerda, studied the company's technology, based largely on the original patent, and and provided a thorough analysis in a 2007 article &lt;em&gt;Charlatanry in forensic speech science: A problem to be taken seriously, &lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;which appeared in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;International Journal of Speech Language and the Law (IJSLL), vol 14.2 2007, 169–193, Equinox Publishing. Eriksson and Lacerda conclude, regarding the original technology on which Nemesysco's products are based, Layered Voice Analysis (LVA), that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Any qualified speech scientist with some computer background can see at a glance, by consulting the documents, that the methods on which the program is based have no scientific validity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;OK, now for the censorship stuff. This is ugly. But complicated. As &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/210/1"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the AAAS's Science website, Nemesysco's lawyers wrote to the publisher of IJSLL, and forced it to retract the Eriksson and Lacerda article, ceasing to distribute the article electronically. (See &lt;em&gt;Brouhaha Over Controversial Forensic Technology: Journal Caves to Legal Threat&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;, cached version &lt;a href="http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;amp;page_id=-1507669250&amp;amp;page_url=%2f%2fsciencenow.sciencemag.org%2fcgi%2fcontent%2ffull%2f2009%2f210%2f1&amp;amp;page_last_updated=2%2f15%2f2009+2%3a35%3a56+AM&amp;amp;firstName=Amir&amp;amp;lastName=Liberman"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;Nemesysco's point seems to have been that the article was unnecessarily personal. And here's the complication: it was indeed not necessary for the article to revolve as much as it did around the character of the founder of Nemesysco, Amir Liberman (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001396.html"&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; no relation!). The article clearly suggests Amir Liberman is a charlatan. Now, I'm convinced that Amir Liberman is in fact a charlatan. And I also think that the article is well-researched, and makes no unsubstantiated claims. Furthermore, and although this is unconventional in scientific journals, the article is greatly enhanced as regards its narrative structure by having a real live bad guy as the central character. But I'm not a lawyer, and can't evaluate whether any case against the journal would have had legal merit. So, I'm not going to debate the legal ins and outs. You can read around the web (e.g. on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesysco"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) and, if you understand such things, decide for yourself. Whatever the legal issues, the possibility of such censorship is very disturbing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;The only thing about this affair that pleases me is that Nemesysco's action has without doubt brought more attention to the article, not less: you can find the original article online &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/9673590/Eriksson-Lacerda-2007?autodown=pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I imagine thousands of people have downloaded it. If enough of us to do the same, Nemesysco's censorship will obviously have failed to achieve its main objective. Having been withdrawn by the publisher, the article has perhaps lost the (anyway illusory) aura of scholarly perfection that a published peer reviewed article carries. But it won't have disappeared. And maybe, as a result of all this attention, some potential purchaser of Nemesysco's products, be it an insurance company or a government body, will think to ask a linguist before spending the money of customers, stockholders or taxpayers on bullshit that gives speech technology a bad name. Or maybe, just maybe, companies like Nemesysco will be encouraged to stop bullshitting, and start presenting customers with enough information to perform a fair assessment of their products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although gains have been made in both areas, they are strongest for the nine year old level. By the time you've reached the high school level, gains have been pretty marginal since the 1970's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't let that from people saying it's effective. The education secretary, Margaret Spellings is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/education/29scores.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=us"&gt;quoted in the NY Times&lt;/a&gt; as saying,&lt;small&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s not an accident that we’re seeing the most improvement where N.C.L.B. has focused most vigorously.... The law focuses on math and reading in grades three through eight — it’s not about high schools. So these results are affirming of our accountability-type approach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Wonderful. We give kids a boost early on, but still allow our education to drop the ball by the time they complete high school. That's great!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other interesting thing I found in the Report Card is that although the gender gap in math and science &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/11/stem-women.html"&gt;is usually reported to be large&lt;/a&gt;, the report card &lt;a href="http://nationsreportcard.gov/ltt_2008/ltt0004.asp"&gt;shows it to be small&lt;/a&gt;, at least in terms of math. Although it grows by the high school level (but only to 6 points out of 500 in the most recent year), it suggests that females aren't going into science and technology fields due to a lack of preparation or ability. Rather, the lack of females in these fields is more due to cultural stigmata drawing females into other lines of work. Something for teachers to keep in mind.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-3448921397845482597?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241062476377"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4249">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4dc5ec3ac886e158</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="toddwood" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Todd Wood"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="creationism"/><title type="html">Sadly, Another Honest Creationist</title><published>2009-04-30T03:36:11Z</published><updated>2009-04-30T03:36:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/sadly-another-h.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins has a classic essay on Kurt Wise’s beliefs titled &lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_21_4.html" rel="external "&gt;Sadly, an Honest Creationist&lt;/a&gt;.  Dawkins wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurt Wise doesn’t need the challenge; he volunteers that, even if all the evidence in the universe flatly contradicted Scripture, and even if he had reached the point of admitting this to himself, he would still take his stand on Scripture and deny the evidence. This leaves me, as a scientist, speechless. I cannot imagine what it must be like to have a mind capable of such doublethink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now another creation “scientist,” trained in a secular university with a legitimate science Ph.D., has acknowledged much the same thing in a little stronger terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bryan.edu/wood.html" rel="external "&gt;Todd Wood&lt;/a&gt; is Director of the &lt;a href="http://www.bryan.edu/core.html" rel="external "&gt;Center for Origins Research&lt;/a&gt; and an Associate Professor of Science at &lt;a href="http://www.bryan.edu/" rel="external "&gt;Bryan College&lt;/a&gt; in Dayton, Tennessee.  He has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Virginia and is a member of AAAS, the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, and the Society for Systematic Biology.  He is an active participant in &lt;a href="http://www.creationbiology.org/content.aspx?page_id=0&amp;amp;club_id=201240" rel="external "&gt;BSG: A Creation Biology Study Group&lt;/a&gt;, the Baraminology Study Group founded to do research on discerning the original Biblical “kinds,” mostly via hybridization studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Wood has made a statement similar to Wise’s but stronger.  Wise said only that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth, I am a young-age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture. As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turns against creationism, I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate. Here I must stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood goes further.  In a post titled &lt;a href="http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2009/04/give-exegetical-answer.html" rel="external "&gt;Give an exegetical answer&lt;/a&gt; he wrote &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have hope because I’m a sinner saved by grace. That’s my whole reason. It’s not because I can refute evolution (&lt;em&gt;I can’t&lt;/em&gt;) or because I can prove the Flood (&lt;em&gt;I can’t&lt;/em&gt;) or because I can make evolutionists look silly (I don’t). (Italics added)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can’t refute evolution, he can’t prove the Flood, but nevertheless he believes.  (I strongly doubt he can make evolutionists look silly to anyone but a flock of ignorant believers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup.  Sadly, another honest creationist.  Would that Ken Ham and his house “scientists,” people like Georgia Purdom and Jason Lisle, were at least that minimally honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's old news from last year, but was featured in &lt;a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090420/HEALTH/904200301/1006/NEWS"&gt;a recent article from Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, about the potential to adopt a similar program: Pennsylvania's &lt;a href="http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/ServicesPrograms/Autism/003677257.htm"&gt;autism medicaid waiver program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Gov. Ed Rendell signed the waiver into law, there were no dedicated services for adults with autism in the state, said Wall-Cote, who lives in Chadds Ford. By comparison, the state spends about $185 million each year on medical-assistance programs for children with autism. The autism waiver mirrors a similar program for Pennsylvania residents with mental retardation, one that most adults with autism don't qualify for because they aren't mentally retarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuse and neglect in group homes was the topic of a Pittsburgh TV station.  Not only is abuse and neglect alarming, so too is the fact that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania allows for an inescapable conflict of interest when it comes to investigating reports of abuse in group homes. The companies that own them are permitted to investigate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three women in a San Diego neighborhood went to court to have one family restricted to their house and driveway. According to yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.postchronicle.com/news/breakingnews/article_212226398.shtml?ref=rss"&gt;Post-Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;, Gary and Marla Trussle believe that the three are "discriminating against the boy, Spencer, because he has autism":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neighbors said they feared Spencer "might come out with a firearm at any time," the broadcaster said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought they had lost their minds," Marla Trussle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge has thrown out the case.&lt;/p&gt;

And it’s due in large part to the local skeptics group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene L. Chiappetta, Professor of Science Education at the &lt;a href="http://www.coe.uh.edu/database/facultytemplate.cfm?ID=25"&gt;University of Houston&lt;/a&gt;, attended a recent gathering of the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/HoustonSkeptics/"&gt;Houston Area Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, and was so impressed by the level of critical thinking in the face of outrageous claims (not to mention the drinking and debauchery) that he decided to get his graduate students involved in a series of investigations into the types of subjects we discuss here on &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment was for each student to apply what they know of science to topics that range from medical claims — like those in fad diets, herbal remedies, and homeopathic medicine — to far out claims like ESP, psychokinesis, and even hauntings and crypto-zoology. Moreover, the eight students that make up the graduate level education class, which focuses on science methods in an educational setting, were asked to prepare a 20-minute presentation of what their investigations uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds exciting, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in addition to that, the presentations have been opened up to the public. Everyone is invited to stop by Kiva Auditorium in &lt;a href="http://www.uh.edu/campus_map/buildings/FH.php"&gt;Farish Hall&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href="http://www.uh.edu/cgi-bin/campusmap"&gt;main campus&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Houston this Saturday, May 2, 2009. The presentations will begin at 9:00am CST and wrap up sometime around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it a big step to have good, investigative presentations open to the anyone who wants to attend, but it is encouraging that graduate students who will one day be teachers themselves are applying good critical thinking skills to outrageous claims that may fall outside of what they normally encounter in a straight science classroom, but that can affect the general public nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/HoustonSkeptics/calendar/10242095/"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the Houston Area Skeptics (including me) will be in attendance, with plans to have a delicious lunch and much socializing following the presentations. If you live in the Houston area, come join us for what will no doubt be a fun Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241039544863"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2721689423620733566">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67decb67eb9ca551</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Some scientists are astrologers, therefore science and astrology are compatible</title><published>2009-04-29T19:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T21:12:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/some-scientists-are-astrologers.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2721689423620733566/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2721689423620733566" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Most people would laugh at you if you were to say that, &amp;quot;Some scientists are astrologers, therefore science and astrology are compatible.&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s a serious logical flaw in that statement.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think a lot of impressionable girls, especially in that middle-school age group, get the idea that they can't be good at science or math if they like clothes, makeup, and boys. Is it the science/math sterotype that is the problem, or is it that girls make other choices to pursue these alternate interests? "I want to be pretty, so I don't want to be a scientist, etc" or is it "I'm bad at math and science, so I should be pretty and study art."

&lt;p&gt;Girls' test scores and grades don't fall behind boys in these subjects until that age, and I find it hard to believe that girls suddenly lose the ability to do math and science. If more positive role models were present, then girls might see that they can study science and be feminine as well. I think that may be the real issue to closing the gender gap in the sciences.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has me wondering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/math_and_science_versus_femini.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/math_and_science_versus_femini.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/-9Qge5Hu98k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241033700064"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1650">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5af05cbad2712c0b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gardening"/><category term="Wordless Wednesday"/><title type="html">Brief bits of bliss</title><published>2009-04-29T19:33:08Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T19:33:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/brief-bits-of-bliss/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qw88nb88.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=240321&amp;amp;post=1650&amp;amp;subd=qw88nb88&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>andrea</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Andrea&amp;#39;s Buzzing About:</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241033650598"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7041">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/388601bb007b587d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">4.29 Afternoon Inquisition</title><published>2009-04-29T19:00:20Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T19:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7041" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, Wednesday’s A.I. comes to us courtesy from &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7038"&gt;last week’s Comment o’ the Week winner&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When perusing our Skepchicks website, I often notice how we&lt;br&gt;
tend to comment or respond to articles and questions. Sometimes, I see&lt;br&gt;
responses to an article that seem to ignore the preceding comments, as&lt;br&gt;
if the author simply wanted to make their thoughts on the subject&lt;br&gt;
known.&lt;br&gt;
And sometimes, once a discussion gets going, I see a lot of&lt;br&gt;
back-and-forth that suggests we are thinking off the tops of our&lt;br&gt;
heads, or from our guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I wonder; how many of us, when arguing a point, make use of&lt;br&gt;
primary and secondary resource materials? How often do we cite for our&lt;br&gt;
opinions? And how often do we shift our stances based upon preceeding&lt;br&gt;
comments?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, do you think we adequately show our Skeptical, Rational&lt;br&gt;
colours when flitting about the Intertubes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of it are the two papers which calculate the odds of exceeding a predefined threshold of 2°C as a function of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Both find that the most directly relevant quantity is the total amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ultimately released, rather than a target atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration or emission rate.  This is an extremely useful result, giving us a clear statement of how our policy goals should be framed.  We have a total emission quota; if we keep going now, we will have to cut back more quickly later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is uncertainty in the climate sensitivity of the Earth and in the response of the carbon cycle, and the papers are extremely useful in the way that they propagate these uncertainties to the probabilities of different amounts of warming.  Just looking at the median model results, many people conclude that a moderately optimistic but not terribly aggressive scenario such as IPCC B1 would avoid 2°C warming relative to pre-industrial. But when you take into account the uncertainty, you find that there is a disturbingly high likelihood (roughly even odds) that it won't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/carbon_NV.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/carbon_NV.jpg" alt="Schmidt and Archer N and V figure" width="50%" align="right" style="padding-left:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Both papers come to the same broad conclusion, summarized in our figure, that unless humankind puts on the brakes very quickly and aggressively (i.e. global reductions of 80% by 2050), we face a high probability of driving climate beyond a 2°C threshold taken by both studies as a “danger limit”. Comparing the two papers is obscured by the different units; mass of carbon versus mass of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (moles, anyone?  Is there a chemist in the house?). But chugging through the math, we find the papers to be broadly consistent.  Both papers conclude that humankind is already about half-way toward releasing enough carbon to probably reach 2°C, and that most of the fossil fuel carbon (the coal, in particular) will have to remain in the ground.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel compelled to note that even a "moderate" warming of 2°C stands a strong chance of provoking drought and storm responses that could challenge civilized society, leading potentially to the conflict and suffering that go with failed states and mass migrations.  Global warming of 2°C would leave the Earth warmer than it has been in millions of years, a disruption of climate conditions that have been stable for longer than the history of human agriculture.  Given the drought that already afflicts Australia, the crumbling of the sea ice in the Arctic, and the increasing storm damage after only 0.8°C of warming so far, calling 2°C a danger limit seems to us pretty cavalier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are dangers to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission other than the peak, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/irreversible-does-not-mean-unstoppable/langswitch_lang/pr"&gt;long tail of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; perturbation&lt;/a&gt; which will dominate the ultimate sea level response, and the acidification of the ocean.  A building may be safe from earthquakes but if it is susceptible to fires it is still considered unsafe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of emission cuts that are required are technologically feasible, if we were to build wind farms instead of coal plants, an integrated regional or global electrical power grid, and undertake a crash program in energy efficiency.  But getting everybody to agree to this is the discouraging part.  The commentary by Parry et al advises us to prepare to adapt to climate changes of at least 4°C, even though they recognize that it may not be possible to buy our way out of most of the damage (to natural systems, for example, including the irreversible loss of many plant and animal species).  Anyway, how does one "adapt" to a train wreck?  There is also the fairness issue, in that the beneficiaries of fossil energy (rich countries today) are not the ones who pay the costs (less-rich countries decades from now).  We wonder why we were not advised to prepare to adapt to crash curtailing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which sounds to us considerably less frightening.  &lt;/p&gt;

Soon afterwards, as a beginning maths undergraduate at Cambridge, I had become even more committed to the subject, after having spent some time reading about the history of the subject, and becoming enthralled by the lives and contributions of some of the great mathematicians. Among these, I found myself personally drawn to Bertrand Russell, partly because I was more interested in philosophy then than I am these days, but mostly because of the sheer grandness of the vision embodied in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica"&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - the opus co-authored by Russell with Alfred North Whitehead - and it’s later challenge from Gödel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as one gets older, reads more, and hopefully gains a more sophisticated knowledge of the subject, one’s tastes tend to change somewhat. In my case, a gradual shift in my interests from pure to applied mathematics, and finally to theoretical physics opened up an increasing range of giants to understand and respect. Somehow though, I have always retained a soft spot for Russell; perhaps because of his atheism, perhaps because of his breadth, but more so I think, because when I think of him I can quite viscerally recall the way reading about him made me feel about mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, while I have never become an avid reader of graphic novels, I’m hoping to get hold of a copy of Apostolos Doxiadis’ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/"&gt;Logicomix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I learned about via &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/apr/27/graphic-novel-logicomix-bertrand-russell"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and which the web site describes as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covering a span of sixty years, the graphic novel Logicomix was inspired by the epic story of the quest for the Foundations of Mathematics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a heroic intellectual adventure most of whose protagonists paid the price of knowledge with extreme personal suffering and even insanity.  The book tells its tale in an engaging way, at the same time complex and accessible. It grounds the philosophical struggles on the undercurrent of personal emotional turmoil, as well as the momentous historical events and ideological battles which gave rise to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of narrator is given to the most eloquent and spirited of the story’s protagonists, the great logician, philosopher and pacifist Bertrand Russell. It is through his eyes that the plights of such great thinkers as Frege, Hilbert, Poincaré, Wittgenstein and Gödel come to life, and through his own passionate involvement in the quest that the various narrative strands come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web site contains a few samples of what to expect, plus a nice summary of the &lt;a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=92&amp;amp;Itemid=28"&gt;cast of characters&lt;/a&gt;. To a graphic novel newbie like myself, it isn’t obvious what to expect from a telling of this kind of sweeping academic story in such a format. But &lt;a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=category&amp;amp;layout=blog&amp;amp;id=37&amp;amp;Itemid=18"&gt;the team&lt;/a&gt; involved looks promising, and I’m sufficiently fascinated by the subject matter that I’m really looking forward to getting a look at Logicomix.&lt;/p&gt;

I get to spend a week in Germany, attending the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/2009_Meeting_Chemistry.AxCMS?ActiveID=1338"&gt;Nobel Laureate meetings at Lindau&lt;/a&gt; on 28 June-3 July. I get to have all the fun, but at least you'll benefit indirectly, since I'll be regularly blogging the talks here. In English. You wouldn't want to see the butchery I would do to the lovely German language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking over the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=275"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;, and what jumped out at me right after seeing all those great titles was that they are actually confining Nobel laureates to only half-hour talks. That will be something to see, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/ich_werde_reisen_an_den_bodens.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/qtFaFFX03lo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241032583888"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/ireland_proposes_a_blasphemy_l.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e91090196dbc0f80</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Ireland proposes a blasphemy law</title><published>2009-04-29T19:25:33Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T19:25:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8wI-0U_9zyM/ireland_proposes_a_blasphemy_l.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/ireland_proposes_a_blasphemy_l.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need details of this &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0429/1224245599892.html"&gt;law against blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;. If &amp;quot;Begorrah!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Saints preserve us!&amp;quot; are outlawed, then Irish stereotypes will be utterly demolished. On the other hand, one Irish fellow I knew used the peculiar expression &amp;quot;fewkin&amp;#39;&amp;quot; as every other word…I presume charming references to sexual acts will not be regarded as blasphemous? Otherwise, the charm of the Irish vernacular will be lost to us forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the only definition I've seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blasphemous matter" is defined as matter "that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion; and he or she intends, by the publication of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, they&amp;#39;re going to make this work in Ireland? So the government plans on censoring every mention of &amp;quot;Catholic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Protestant&amp;quot; because they&amp;#39;ll spark outrage in some subset of the population? I think that, in general, prohibiting things because some fraction of the population will feel outraged at the concept would effectively mean that everything should be outlawed. I know I could stand outside any church or cathedral, stamp my foot, and fulminate at length — if only I were Irish, I could stroll the land, casting the priestly snakes off the island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/ireland_proposes_a_blasphemy_l.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8wI-0U_9zyM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241031762265"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4248">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77285822f1f84ca3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Bible as Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Improving science education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="aig" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="AIG"/><category term="sciencefair" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="science fair"/><title type="html">AIG Creation AntiScience Fair</title><published>2009-04-29T18:57:14Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T21:32:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/aig-creation-sc.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month I was a judge at a regional science fair for middle- and high-school students, and it was great to see aisle after aisle of smart and hard-working kids doing interesting and careful science.  A few weeks later, at a Science Cafe where I was presenting, I had the chance to talk with (and coach a little) two of them who are going to nationals.  Those kids are bright shining examples of what we want public education to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there’s the creation science fair.  PZ has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/creation_science_fair_report.php" rel="external "&gt;recently posted&lt;/a&gt; on a creation science fair in Minnesota, but now they’re going big time: Ken Ham’s Creation Museum &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/museum/2009/04/28/top-10-reasons-why-you-should-go-to-the-creation-museum-science-fair-in-2010" rel="external "&gt;is hosting one next year&lt;/a&gt;.  (Added in edit: I see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/oh_joy_another_creation_scienc.php" rel="external "&gt;PZ has posted&lt;/a&gt; on this one already this morning, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a catch, however: In order to enter, kids have to agree with AIG’s &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/faith" rel="external "&gt;Statement of Faith&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other things, that requires that kids sign on to these principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account of origins presented in Genesis is a simple but factual presentation of actual events and therefore provides a reliable framework for scientific research into the question of the origin and history of life, mankind, the Earth and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great Flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By definition, no apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those, of course, are the antithesis of science.  Having kids sign on to presuppositions that reject the evidence that has been accumulated over centuries is the height of science denial, and it is a fraud to label the exercise “science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main things defenders of honest science can do is actively and continuously support science education, particularly at the K-12 levels.  Get to know the science teachers in your kids’ middle school and high school.  Volunteer as a judge at local and regional science fairs.  Go to parent-teacher conferences and board of education meetings with appropriate questions about what’s being taught.  Volunteer to give a talk or lead a discussion on science in a church or YMCA or public library.  Write coherent and cogent letters to newspapers.  Start a Science Cafe, or volunteer to give a presentation in one.  Above all, don’t sit around waiting for an engraved invitation: &lt;em&gt;get out there and support science education!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Francis Collins and Karl Giberson, with funding from the Templeton Foundation (who else?), have put together a whole website full of fluffy bunnies and pious weasels to reconcile science and faith. It&amp;#39;s a rich vein of the worst of pseudo-scientific apologetics, and I am stunned by it — not because I am impressed by the substance, but because it is such a target-rich environment. Having read both Collins&amp;#39; &lt;i&gt;Language of God&lt;/i&gt;, with it's amazing conversion experience that had to have impressed all with its depth and majesty, and the equally wooly-minded &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/theology_is_a_deceitful_strate.php"&gt;Karl Giberson's&lt;/a&gt; book, &lt;i&gt;Saving Darwin&lt;/i&gt;, I can say I &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; these two would have put together a web site &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I say, I'm overwhelmed with the tripe available on that site, so I'll just have to take a poke at one small example. They actually have a page to address the question of &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/questions/problem-of-evil/"&gt;How does the evil and suffering in the world align with the idea of a loving God?&lt;/a&gt;. As one who often hears the atheists accused of being philosophically shallow, this page is a consolation: it&amp;#39;s a collection of tired cliches that don&amp;#39;t answer the question. There&amp;#39;s the usual &amp;quot;Free will!&amp;quot; blather, and the &amp;quot;god works in mysterious ways&amp;quot; nonsense, and as a special bonus, there&amp;#39;s the extra-special &amp;quot;We Christians are special because our god suffered, too&amp;quot; excuse (which answers nothing, but raises many more questions about this contradictory deity of theirs). One curious thing about the approach this site takes is that it is slathered with Jesus everywhere — if you aren&amp;#39;t already a New Testament lovin&amp;#39; evangelical, you are not going to be at all impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's one special case of their problem of evil logic, of interest to us non-Jebusites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering is Also a Problem for Atheists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evil also poses problems for the nonbeliever. Claims that torture is wrong even though the victims of torture might be terrorists with useful information appeal to some external standard. But what is this standard? Such claims need to be grounded in something if they are to be asserted with such confidence. So, while some naturalistic philosophers have developed ethical systems without God, many other naturalists acknowledge this doesn't work and that such ethical systems are entirely arbitrary. If God does not exist and there is no grounding for how things ought to be, then moral -- as opposed to emotional -- outrage at horrendous evil has no basis. The fact that we cannot escape our sense of horror and outrage at evil actually points us to God's existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, no. This is all wrong. Evil is not a problem for us. I believe that we are a rare cosmic accident in an impersonal and hostile universe — the natural state is one which is largely inimical to our existence. I also don&amp;#39;t think human beings are designed at all, but evolved by natural mechanisms, and that we are not by any means optimized for anything, let alone any kind of local definition of goodness.  That bad things happen, that accidents occur, that many normal events can lead to our death or suffering, that humans are flawed and can harm one another…all of that is to be &lt;i&gt;expected&lt;/i&gt;. We atheists certainly do not have the kind of problem with evil that a believer in a universal benignity would have, so this is a bit of a dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you could turn it around and say that atheists have a problem with goodness, which is ultimately what Collins/Giberson are trying to say. But once again, Collins makes the same mistake he did in his book — he can&amp;#39;t imagine any source of morality other than an external imposition by a moral entity, and reveals again that he doesn&amp;#39;t actually have any understanding of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are social animals. We are the children of a particular kind of animal that improved their chances of survival and reproduction by &lt;i&gt;cooperation&lt;/i&gt;, working together as a family/tribe/nation. We have an operational, working definition of what is good and evil that is defined by our history: goodness is that which has promoted the survival of our community and ourselves. Anyone who has a reasonable grasp of Darwinian logic ought to be able to see that this is the kind of property that can emerge from forces entirely within a group's history, with no exogenous agent required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly do have grounds to be outraged at the use of torture. Those are fellow human beings who are experiencing pain: I empathize with them, I see them as fellow members of the greater community of humanity, and I can rationally see that a society that allows torture is one in which I and my family are less safe. I do not need a little god sitting on my shoulder, whispering in my ear, "Oh, PZ, you aren't supposed to enjoy that person's suffering".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sense of horror and outrage points me to a common humanity, not some invisible magic man who wills it because he works in mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, any rationalization that claims that &amp;quot;if god doesn&amp;#39;t exist, then you have no reason to be moral&amp;quot; is making the fallacy of arguing from consequences. It does not imply the truth of the statement.

I know, I know. I spend considerable time writing about fools and charlatans, but this is a different kind of messed up, in which hatefulness is added to the ignorance. Consider &lt;a href="http://www.10news.com/news/19306624/detail.html"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, sent to me by a reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm 4 years old," he said, "and I have a sister named Olivia, and I ride my bike all day long."

&lt;p&gt;He lives in a piece of suburbia that seems picturesque: the Venzano development in San Marcos. His parents, Gary and Marla Trussle, moved the family here five months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I thought it would be good for the children," Marla Trussle explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of being welcomed, the Trussle family has been under attack, they said, by neighbors. The accusations against them have been wild, including that 4-year-old Spencer "might come out with a firearm at anytime."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I thought they had lost their minds," said Marla Trussle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are neighbors Sarah Fisher, Danielle Harway and Kelly Plaster. All three filed court papers asking that Spencer, his sister Olivia, and mom and dad be restricted to their own home and driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There was nothing I had done, my husband had done, my daughter had done, or I had done that warranted that response," said Trussle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In court papers, Sarah Fisher wrote that, "Gary Trussle is a very violent, unstable and unpredictable man." Daniele Harway said, "He looked to be on drugs." And Kelly Plaster added, "I'm concerned that Gary or his son will gain access to Gary's firearms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in this case, reason, common sense, and justice appear to have prevailed. After these neighbors from hell had tried to get Child Protective Services involved and complained to Trussle's employer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/disgusting.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/disgusting.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/t2za3hhs0Mg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241030015850"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4247">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d1d4fbb8928659d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Francis Beckwith&amp;#39;s Letter to The Editor (Updated!)</title><published>2009-04-29T18:31:26Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T22:09:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/francis-beckwit-1.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis Beckwith has published &lt;a href="http://www.whatswrongwiththeworld.net/2009/04/my_chapman_law_review_letter_t.html" rel="external "&gt;a letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;Chapman Law Review&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;not available online&lt;/span&gt;) alleging that I misrepresented his views in &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905" rel="external "&gt;my recent article in that journal.&lt;/a&gt; I think my article correctly described his views and that his letter–probably intentionally–obscures the issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a fantastic talk, and I immediately had the idea to ask him to come to Caltech at some point and give it as a colloquium.  So tomorrow &lt;a href="http://today.caltech.edu/calendar/item.tcl?calendar_id=96185"&gt;he’ll be here&lt;/a&gt;, and anyone in the neighborhood interested in a semi-technical account of complex systems from physics to biology is welcome to stop by.  He might be angling for the record for the longest talk title ever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	&lt;strong&gt;The Complexity, Simplicity, and Unity of Living Systems from Cells to Cities: A Physicist’s Search for Quantitative, Unified Theories of Biological and Social Structure and Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Although Life is very likely the most complex phenomenon in the Universe, many of it’s most fundamental and complex phenomena scale with size in a surprisingly simple fashion. For example, metabolic rate scales approximately as the 3/4-power of mass over 27 orders of magnitude from complex molecules up to the largest multicellular organisms. Similarly, time-scales (such as lifespans and growth-rates) and sizes (such as genome lengths, RNA densities, and tree heights) scale as power laws with exponents which are typically simple multiples of 1/4. The universality and simplicity of these relationships, together with emergent “universal” invariants, suggest that fundamental constraints underly much of the coarse-grained generic structure and organisation of living systems. It will be shown how these 1/4 power scaling laws follow from underlying principles embedded in the dynamical and geometrical structure of space-filling, fractal-like, hierarchical branching networks, presumed optimised by natural selection. These ideas lead to a general quantitative, predictive theory that potentially captures the essential features of many diverse biological systems. Examples will include vascular systems, growth, cancer, aging and mortality, sleep, cell size, genome lengths, and DNA nucleotide substitution rates. These ideas will be extended to social organisations: to what extent are cities or corporations an extension of biology? Are they “just” very large organisms? Analogous scaling laws reflecting underlying social network structure point to general principles of organization common to all cities, but, counter to biological systems, the pace of social life systematically increases with size. This has dramatic implications for growth, development and particularly for sustainability: innovation and wealth creation that fuel social systems, if left unchecked, potentially sow the seeds for their inevitable collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked before about the difficulty in defining “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/09/08/the-meaning-of-life/"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;,” although one safe criterion is that a living organism is going to be pretty complex.  What about the other way — when you have an undeniably complex system like a city or a university or a galaxy, at what point does it become useful to think of it as a “living organism”?  Those are hard questions, but one angle is to investigate the similarities that complex systems demonstrate as they are manifested at different sizes.  That’s the idea of “scaling laws” — measuring a feature common to a set of complicated systems (number of parts, speed of motion, etc.) and see how they change as a function of scale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have imagined that complexity comes in a variety of completely different forms, and there would be no simple relationship that included viruses, house cats, and sprawling urban centers.  But the data reveal a remarkable degree of regularity — many complex systems share certain basic features, just scaled up or down in ways appropriate to their size.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one startling example:  every living being on Earth gets about &lt;a href="http://hep.ucsb.edu/courses/ph6b_99/0111299sci-scaling.html"&gt;a billion heartbeats&lt;/a&gt; worth of lifespan.  Larger organisms live longer, but their hearts (or other analogous rhythmic processes) beat more slowly.  Use those heartbeats wisely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next challenge, of course, is to understand why.  A few stabs have been taken in that direction using ideas about hierarchical networks of smaller systems — about which I shouldn’t say much, at least until I’ve heard the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;AT&amp;amp;T added 875,000 new postpaid subscribers in the most recent quarter and 1.6 million iPhone activations, “more than 40 percent of them for customers who were new to the company.” That means roughly 640,000, or a whopping 73 percent of their total net new subscribers, came to AT&amp;amp;T because of Apple’s iPhone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;via &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/04/22/why-att-is-desperately-addicted-to-the-iphone/"&gt;gigaom.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the promises of the iPhone, two years ago before it was launched, was that it would change the balance of power in the mobile industry away from the carriers and toward the developers. Apple’s signing an exclusive deal with AT&amp;amp;T seemed to negate the theory, but hopes are once again soaring, aided by these figures and talks of a possible Verizon version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, these numbers aren’t really that encouraging. I remember reading not long ago that the average American switches cell phone providers every 3 or 4 years. I can’t source this one now, so perhaps it was just some jackass on the internet that I mistook for authoritative, but it seems pretty reasonable given the experience of myself and the people I know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you assume it to be true (and I doubt its far off) that means the average phone will be purchased by 25%-33% customers who are new to the network its on. So while the iPhone is clearly overperforming for AT&amp;amp;T, it’s not blowing away the industry average.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the latter number, that 73 percent of new subs came over due to the iPhone, certainly speaks well of Apple’s device, but I think it also speaks very poorly of AT&amp;amp;T.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the data backs up the common sentiment that what we have in the iPhone is a great device tethered to one of the country’s worst networks. Despite having the hottest phone on the market, at least in terms of brand power, Verizon, with their infinitely superior coverage, is fairly well trouncing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me really curious to see what happens next. Between Verizon and Apple, who needs who more? A lot of people are speculating that Apple is leaking information about talks with Verizon to get more money out of AT&amp;amp;T for a continued exclusive contract. I’m not so sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple wants the iPhone to achieve iPod like ubiquity (or at least as close as is reasonably possible in the much more competitive mobile handset industry) they know they’re never going to achieve it on AT&amp;amp;T. They can put out all the new hardware and software they want, but it’s just shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic. AT&amp;amp;T is a sinking ship and has been for years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there’s a respectable chance we’ll see an iPhone on one of the CDMA networks. Despite the standard’s total lack of traction in the rest of the world, the two major providers here offer an unparalleled user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think what I said two years ago when the iPhone was about to launch is true, which is that the balance of power will never shift too far away from the carriers. People choose phones for a lot of reasons, and the network it’s tethered to will always be a big factor.

Well, the Orlando Sentinel has a poll to see whether people think it&amp;#39;s reasonable for a secular state government to be punching out plates endorsing a weird sectarian faith. So far, the kind of people who read the Sentinel think it is. I wonder what the kind of people who read Pharyngula think…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Floridians who are religious should have the right to pay more to show it on their plates. (3592 responses)
 58.3%&lt;br&gt;
Yes. Why is this any different than letting Floridians buy plates to benefit other causes they believe in, like saving manatees? (1131 responses)
 18.4%&lt;br&gt;
No. This goes crashing through the wall that should separate church and state. (1325 responses)
 21.5%&lt;br&gt;
No, because every religion -- and atheists -- will be able to demand a license plate. (112 responses)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show won't go on in Dallas. The Christian Book Expo, an innovative consumer-focused book show, won't be repeated next year. The board of Evangelical Christian Publishers Association, show sponsor, decided not to stage another event in 2010. Attendance at this year's show, held March 20-22 at the Dallas Convention Center, was 1,500; organizers had hoped for 10,000 to 15,000. The show left the organization with a $250,000 shortfall, according to ECPA president and CEO Mark Kuyper. "We want to clean up the debt before we consider future options," Kuyper told PW in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've got your Bible and your copies of the Left Behind books, your good evangelical doesn't need much more.

The thought was to provide greater protection from sexual abuse for people who are unable to consent; however, both the wording of the bill, and the question of where to draw the line on "mental competence" introduce civil rights-threatening ambiguities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the bill states that people over age 60 and people with disabilities who have been declared mentally incompetent cannot give consent to erotic photographs, any more than a minor can give consent. But other parts of the bill only use the term "elders and persons with a disability," without referencing mental competence or consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea that disabled or elderly adults are unable to consent to sexual activities or have no more understanding of sex than children goes right back into the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autistic_adults_are_not_large_children"&gt;large children problem&lt;/a&gt;, and all of its associated stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill seemed particularly goading to people with disabilities, who often have been stereotyped as asexual or childlike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This kind of bill does perpetuate that stigma . . . that once you reach a certain age, or if you have a disability you are no longer sexually attractive, no longer able to have an intimate relationship," said Stanley Ducharme, a Boston psychologist who specializes in sexuality and disabilities. "The whole thing smacks of the idea that there's something negative about sexual expression and seeing an erotic image of an elderly person or a disabled person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important to question, what exactly is "mental competence?"  Who gets to decide?  And who gets to decide whether someone is consenting to a sexual act or not?  Whether someone is under guardianship or not isn't a reliable measure.  There are plenty of adults who have legal guardians, but who are perfectly capable of consenting to sexual acts with other consenting adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While obviously &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/04/pittsburgh-tv-station-investigates.html"&gt;protections are needed&lt;/a&gt;, banning a particular type of sexual activity for an entire segment of the population is just as obviously the wrong way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this problem be dealt with in a way that does not assume disabled or elderly adults are large children?  How can we attack the reasons for why these problems happen, rather than attacking the people they happen to?  Who can speak for whom?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241024798830"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-6731303071421708166">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/47c241a2905a3a25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Maybe a Genetic Cause for Autism</title><published>2009-04-29T15:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T15:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/04/maybe-genetic-cause-for-autism.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">How much money do you want to bet that anti-vax douchebags Jenny McCarthy and her retarded boyfriend Jim Carrey won't ever mention &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-na-autism29-2009apr29,0,4441598.story"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in their little &lt;i&gt;Kill the Children&lt;/i&gt; tours?  I'd bet a lot.&lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers have found that many people with autism share common genetic variations, a discovery that may improve diagnosis and offers the promise of developing treatments for the frustratingly mysterious disorder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the treatments these folks are talking about have nothing to do with a "mommy instinct".  Just a hunch.  Check this out:&lt;blockquote&gt;...most autistic people examined have a genetic variation in a portion of their DNA that affects the way brain cells connect with one another.... Both reports add weight to the idea that autism is related to problems with the way brain cells connect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So it's not vaccines, then?  No?  Right.  I love this bit:&lt;blockquote&gt;Up to now, the medical community could say very little about what causes autism or how to treat it. The lack of scientific knowledge about autism has led to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a proliferation of pseudoscientific explanations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the disorder, as well as unproven treatments.

There was a lively Q&amp;amp;A followed by livelier drinking time followed by the sun coming up and me suddenly realizing I had to go back to work because it was now Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events are captured in &lt;a href="http://www.overcompensating.com/posts/20090429.html"&gt;today’s Overcompensating&lt;/a&gt;, and hooray Jeffrey made me into a cartoon! I hope I make it into future comics, and if so then I hope my character is kicking the crap out of some con artist like John Edward or something.&lt;/p&gt;

She
called Gary Trussell&amp;#39;s employer, Continental Airlines, where he&amp;#39;s a
captain. She also made a call to 911, claiming he couldn&amp;#39;t control his
young children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Subsequently, Fisher and two other neighbors,  Danielle Harway and Kelly Plaster filed suits. Each suit asked that the Trussell family &amp;quot;be
restricted to their own home and driveway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the suits were thrown out and the three litigants were &amp;quot; ordered to reimburse the Trussells&amp;#39; legal fees, which top $12,000.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to send Fisher, Harway, and Plaster to autism awareness training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.10news.com/news/19306624/detail.html"&gt;KGTV San Diego April 27, 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241017717832"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1387">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/087db9b19d267b69</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">A BIG baseball book</title><published>2009-04-29T14:58:41Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T14:58:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1387" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little while back, a representative of the publishers of the third edition of Paul Dickson's &lt;em&gt;Baseball Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; wrote to offer me a free copy, in the hope that I would review the book on Language Log. I replied that I was an idiot about baseball — yes, I know, this totally undercuts any claim I might have to being a real American man, but I coped with that long ago — and so was not the person they wanted to take on this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did buy the book, because I knew that Dickson's dictionary was a work of serious lexicographic scholarship (with careful citations and thoughtful definitions, the sort of thing that could be accommodated in a revision of the &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;). Many specialized dictionaries are not like this, and for good reason: in many domains, the evidence for usages in written texts is very hard to come by, and very spotty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So reports on gay usages are not very reliable, and often not documented. Reports on black usages are better, but not by a whole lot. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But baseball is different. The sports pages of newspaper (many available on-line only recently) are replete with inside baseball lingo, though much of it needs interpretation in context. Dickson has made good use of these resources, with the result that his dictionary has grown from 5,000 entries in the first edition (1989) to 7,000 in the second (1999) and to 10,000 in this one (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current edition turned out to be a much bigger volume than I'd anticipated, a real doorstop of a book, almost a thousand pages. Whether its content gets reviewed here on Language Log or not, I'm sure it will catch attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241017570119"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9995">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8819a0e6e96a5448</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="incentives"/><category term="transit"/><title type="html">Bus-Riders of the World Unite!</title><published>2009-04-29T14:31:21Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T14:31:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/bus-riders-of-the-world-unite/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Remarkable facts from a new paper by James Habyarimana and William Jack of the Center for Global Development:

If we're ignorant and incompetent, then what do you say about them when they recommend and use my book in their college classes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5119776739806641340?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The paper is I.J. Good, "&lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs502/GoodTuring1953.pdf"&gt;The Population Frequencies of Species and the Estimation of Population Parameters&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Biometrika&lt;/em&gt; 40(3-4) 237-264 (1953), and its abstract reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species. (The theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary, for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers n&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 1, 2, 3, …), where n&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (n&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; may be described as `the frequency of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's 'characteristic' and Shannon's 'entropy'. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers n&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In 1953, it was not yet legal to reveal that the mathematics in question had really come out of the cryptological work at Bletchley Park during WW II, where Good had collaborated with Alan Turing on decoding German Enigma messages. The method described in Good's 1953 paper, which has come to be called "Good-Turing smoothing", was used in estimating the parameters of an n-gram model, which in turn could be used to assess the probability that a given letter sequence was really a fragment of German text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lecture notes on Good-Turing smoothing are here: "&lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs502/LNRE.html"&gt;Statistical estimation for Large Numbers of Rare Events&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Needless to say, this was by no means the only work Good ever did –  his &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.web-e.stat.vt.edu/holtzman/IJGood/A_Conversation_with_IJGood_Davild_L_Banks_1992.pdf"&gt;Shorter Publications List&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; runs to 61 pages — but it&amp;#39;s the work that people like me know him best for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memorial page at Virginia Tech, where he worked from 1967 to 1994, is &lt;a href="http://www.stat.vt.edu/facstaff/ijgood.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a news release is here: "&lt;a href="http://www.wsls.com/sls/news/local/new_river_valley/article/virginia_tech_professor_wwii_code-breaker_irving_good_dies/32642/"&gt;Virginia Tech professor, WWII code-breaker Irving Good dies&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can recommend "&lt;a href="http://www.web-e.stat.vt.edu/holtzman/IJGood/A_Conversation_with_IJGood_Davild_L_Banks_1992.pdf"&gt;A conversation with I.J. Good&lt;/a&gt;" from Statistical Science, 11(1): 1-19, 1996. A couple of sample witticisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Some statistical work by Donald Michie and myself, and my insistence that what is not checked is wrong (Good&amp;#39;s law), led to occasional success …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When discussing complex systems, like brains and other societies, it is easy to oversimplify: I call this Occam's lobotomy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The NYT, the Washington Post, and other major U.S. papers don't have anything yet. If this represents an editorial judgment, it's an unfortunate one; if it's due to ignorance, that's unfortunate as well.  I'll continue to hope for the most charitable interpretation, which is that they're as far behind in writing obituaries as I am in working through my to-blog list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1241014927372"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/biodiversity_in_artificial_wet.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22605b92a5bea6fe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Biodiversity in Artificial Wetlands</title><published>2009-04-29T13:47:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T13:47:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/7fXUfDsPwr4/biodiversity_in_artificial_wet.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/biodiversity_in_artificial_wet.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=708&amp;amp;news_item=3596"&gt;recent press release&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Lund includes a confusing contradiction. Summarising Dr. Geraldine Thiere's recent doctoral dissertation, &lt;i&gt;Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning in Created Agricultural Wetlands&lt;/i&gt;, the release claims that on one hand natural wetlands are not more biodiverse than recently dug ponds, on the other hand that biodiversity in wetlands increases with age. Both statements can't be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had written to Dr. Thiere she kindly clarified the matter for me. It turns out that arguably &lt;i&gt;neither&lt;/i&gt; of the two contradictory statements is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Thiere hasn't studied any natural wetlands.&lt;blockquote&gt;"I actually compared the diversity and composition of created wetlands with old ponds in the agricultural landscape. These ponds were 50 to 100 years old and stem from clay diggings &lt;i&gt;märgelhålor&lt;/i&gt;; they are at least semi-natural systems. There was no difference between the diversity and composition of macroinvertebrates in created wetlands and old ponds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit complicated to compare created wetlands to real, natural wetlands; partly because there are so few left in the agricultural landscape, partly because the wetlands created today are not neccessarily similar to the wetlands that were once lost. Created wetlands are most alike to small ponds (&lt;i&gt;dammar&lt;/i&gt;); natural wetlands on the other hand may not have a permanent water surface (more like a &lt;i&gt;mosse&lt;/i&gt;)."&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the increase in biodiversity over time that she has documented occurred over a period of only six years.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wetland age seems to 'enhance' macroinvertebrate diversity, i.e. older wetlands (in my case 5-6 years) hosted more macroinvertebrate species than younger wetlands (they also hosted different species combinations). ... natural wetlands are present in the landscape for a long time, and the question is if created wetlands (even 6 year old ones) come even close to the natural diversity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's the question. Maybe a wetland hits maximum biodiversity already within a few years of its creation. Or maybe an artificial wetland remains relatively poor compared to natural wetlands even after a hundred years. But that's not the question Geraldine Thiere's research was designed to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman in South Carolina says she sees Jesus in a piece of toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wood bark, or an oil stain, or an insect’s carapace, but an actual honest-to-FSM piece of toast. Just like old times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it looks nothing at all like Jesus to me, certainly less than &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/13/jesus-in-the-kit-kat-den/"&gt;the Kit Kat of yore&lt;/a&gt;.

Or maybe &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=karen+carpenter"&gt;Karen Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is… the woman who found Jesus in her toast is, I think, a little optimistic. Because if she flips it over, it ain’t Jesus. Could it be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TUSCARORA, Nev. — The residents of this tiny town, anticipating an imminent attack, will be ready with a perimeter defense. They’ll position their best weapons at regular intervals, faced out toward the desert to repel the assault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then they’ll turn up the volume.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Rock music blaring from boomboxes has proved one of the best defenses against an annual invasion of Mormon crickets…the crickets don’t much fancy Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones, the townspeople figured out three years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any scientific evidence I can find that this will have any effect on the crickets.  (Which, technically, are not crickets, but &lt;a title="about mormon crickets" href="http://www.sidney.ars.usda.gov/grasshopper//Research/mcricket.htm"&gt;katydids&lt;/a&gt;.)  But it’s got to be pretty darn entertaining to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, a million bucks for Mormon Cricket control was &lt;a title="Run! Giant Katydids!!" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031603299.html"&gt;widely mocked in March as “Pork Barrel” spending&lt;/a&gt; in the budget.  These are people who clearly haven’t seen the insects on the march as a giant swarm. &lt;a title="YouTube video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBLkApnjrE&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;It’s impressive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
When you have a 1-2 inch insect, and you measure &lt;a href="http://www.sidney.ars.usda.gov/grasshopper//Extras/2008_GH.htm"&gt;density as &amp;gt;15 insects/square yard&lt;/a&gt;…that’s a lot of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; suggest for your repelling playlist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Attacks!#Plot"&gt;Slim Whitman&lt;/a&gt; would be my obvious first choice…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the weird news just keeps coming in from my hometown. This time around, consider the case of Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell is a tiny Chihuahua weighing all of five pounds. This poor little creature met nature in a most unfortunate way on Saturday, when some rather heavy storms swept through southeast Michigan. It turns out that storms and Chihuahuas don't mix very well (as you might expect), and poor Tinker Bell discovered that in a &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20090428/NEWS03/90428001/1001/rss01"&gt;most harsh way&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tinkerbelle was with her owners, Lavern and Dorothy Utley of Rochester, when a powerful storm swept into the Dixie Land Flea Market in Waterford.

&lt;p&gt;The storm packed wind gusts of more 70 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the gusts lifted up Tinkerbelle and carried the dog away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They tried to catch her too but nobody could. The wind had her and she was just going on and her collar was found across the street," said Dorothy Utley. "She flew and she went over three lanes into the woods."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Goldberg is the manager of the flea market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the storm came up suddenly and began sweeping away equipment from the more than 100 vendors at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was just like the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto," Goldberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Utley family searched the area through the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel for the Utleys. Really, I can. I may not be a big fan of Chihuahuas. (I prefer larger dogs.) I would never make fun of anyone who lost their dog. I can totally understand their going to radio stations for help, which apparently the Utleys did on Monday morning. Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. But how? Surely you must be able to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right.

Dr. Rachael Dunlop of the Australian Skeptics, who does Dr. Rachie Reports for their podcast The Skeptic Zone, has written a &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/anti-vaxers-the-story-so-far/"&gt;summary of recent events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing part of this story, at least for somewhat jaded skeptics, is the mostly responsible manner in which Australia’s Channel 7 has dealt with this issue. It began with a report by Rebecca Maddern on “Sunday Night” which was an overtly scientific and pro-vaccie piece. Instead of token talking-head skeptics juxtaposed against amazing personal stories or kind-hearted (appearing) practitioners, there was token anti-vax cranks juxtaposed against children sick from vaccine-preventable diseases. Australia is apparently bizzaro-world for skeptics (maybe that explains the “c”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even gets more bizzaro. Both sides mobilized the troops, flooding the station with either praise or criticism. This prompted them to plan for a debate on the vaccine-autism topic. Dr. Rachie reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was informed by Channel 7 that Meryl Dorey will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be on the panel since they; “only want people with a scientific background”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dorey is an anti-vaccine loon.)  Imagine that - only soliciting scientific opinions on an important public health issue from scientists. Apparently they are having trouble finding a doctor or scientist who will take up the anti-vax position. The antivaccination lobby is beside themselves - why won’t the station just have on mindless celebrities like we do here in the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously - it’s good to have the occasional reminder that there are responsible journalists out there. We often get caught up doing damage control for terrible science journalism we need to also praise and recognize those who are doing a good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So check out Dr. Rachie’s &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/anti-vaxers-the-story-so-far/"&gt;full details of the event&lt;/a&gt;, with her updates, and perhaps even take a moment to let your voice be heard by Channel 7.&lt;/p&gt;

This is especially true if the criticism is legitimate and one cannot reasonably counter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantive criticism is also a central part of the scientific endeavor, and so the culture of science has developed a tolerance for harsh criticism and a general understanding that the only proper response is with logic and evidence. Examples of exceptions are legion, human frailty being what it is, but you cannot live in the world of science for long without learning the rules of the game. Peers are expected to pull no punches when criticizing the errors or countering the arguments of their colleagues. Everyone is expected to be their own harshest critic (criticize your own data before someone has a chance to). And when criticized yourself, acknowledge what is legitimate and make appropriate corrections, but feel free to defend yourself against weak criticisms by pointing out additional data, interpretations, or errors in the arguments of your critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meat grinder approach to scientific discourse works.  Slowly, bad ideas and claims are beaten down, and only good ideas have the stamina to persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here at science-based medicine we engage not only with the scientific community, but also with the public, and with those on the fringes of science. This means we often engage with those who do not play by the rules of science. A recent example is that of J.B. Handley from Age of Autism.&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt; David Gorski&lt;/a&gt; and I (and later &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=466"&gt;Mark Crislip&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459"&gt;wrote blog entries&lt;/a&gt; criticizing their 14 studies website with a detailed analysis. Handley responded with a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;full frontal personal assault&lt;/a&gt; sprinkled with irrelevant accusations. He ignored the vast majority of our actual criticisms, and those few he took on he completely botched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the targets of scientific criticism respond with another tactic - the diversion. Rather than make an obvious ad hominem attack, they try to distract the public (often the real target of the exchange) from the points of the criticism with a series of non sequiturs. They try to “re-frame” the discussion to make it about something other than the scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists recently have been masters of this latter tactic. On scientific grounds, there is no debate about evolution. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community agrees that evolution happened, there is common descent, and natural selection is a dominant mechanism. Creationists cannot win this fight scientifically (though they keep trying), and so they try to distract from the science by trying to make it a political debate. So they accuse scientists of being dogmatic, of trying to exclude creationists from the debate, or for unfairly eliminating supernatural explanations from consideration. First they tried “teach the (fake) controversy,” and now they are trying “teach the strengths and (fake) weaknesses” of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who promote unscientific claims in medicine are no different. When scientists bother to examine their claims and level the sort of criticism typical of the scientific community at them, they often respond with some combination of personal attacks and distraction. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=463"&gt;Last week I criticised the Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; for running a series of blogs and articles that are promoting dangerously pseudoscientific medical claims. I specifically commented on an outrageous article by Kim Evans, promoting the absurd claim that all cancers are caused by fungal infections, which in turn are caused by antibiotics. Evans has responded (sort of) with &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/health-care-scientific-or_b_190680.html"&gt;this week’s column&lt;/a&gt;, in which she addresses her critics, without naming anyone in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her response is right out of the pseudoscientific health claim play book, under “how to distract from legitimate criticism with logical fallacies and misdirection.” We have literally heard it all before, and have even answered much of it in detail. I will therefore not reiterate points that have been made before but will link to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/antibiotics-cause-cancer_b_186968.html"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; I got a lot of flack for not speaking like a scientist. Something in that rubs me the wrong way because it presumes that only by a very narrow method can we come to any valid conclusions or make any new discoveries about the world we live in - while also presuming that only a tiny portion of the population, with a very specific set of skills and communication methods, has the ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here she is combing two common tactics - the claim that her critics are being elitist and that science it too narrow to encompass her wisdom (and she goes much further on these themes in the following paragraphs). Rather, she was criticized for promoting a dangerous health scam and not even attempting to justify it with anything resembling acceptable scientific evidence. In response to this criticism she did not either acknowledge the lack of evidence or provide references to such evidence - instead she “reframed” the criticism as being equivalent to saying that she is not in the club - an obvious appeal to elitism. (Handley, by the way, pulled the exact same ploy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She might as well have written that we were trying to “expel” her from the scientific discussion, because what she is doing is exactly the same as the Intelligent Design proponents tactics used in the movie by that name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First she states that she was criticized for not behaving like a scientist, then she states, essentially, that science is not all its cracked up to be anyway.  At least she is being openly anti-science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attitude derives from the premise that the methods of science are optional - just one way of knowing how nature works. This is, in my opinion, the core of the struggle between science-based medicine and everything else.  But which &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=120"&gt;rules of science&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder, would Evans recommend we abandon when it suits us? Should we ignore inconvenient evidence rather than take a systematic approach, use ambiguous criteria that are susceptible to bias, or not control for confounding variables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing magical or arbitrary about the methods of science - they are merely careful observation and intellectual honesty rigorously applied.  To say this is a “narrow” approach is to misunderstand science or a deliberate distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next she launches into the toxin gambit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in 2005 found that newborns are being born with&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/105588"&gt; literally hundreds of chemicals&lt;/a&gt; in their bloodstream, many of them known to cause cancer. Most people eat pesticides and herbicides in their every meal. I don’t need to tell you that these substances are designed to kill living organisms, because you already know that, but might I remind you that you, too, are a living organism. Rocket fuel has been found in milk. Drugs and birth control have been found in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only evidence she provides to support her claims is a link to a Newsweek article.  This is acceptable form in general for a blog, but does not do much to bolster her claims. The referenced article does site several studies that found detectable levels of various chemicals in the general population, but it also cites two NIH reviews of this data. The first found that there was little cause for concern, and the second that, based on animal data, there may be cause for concern and further study is necessary.  This hardly supports the alarm bell Evans is ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this does not have anything to do with the criticisms of her original article, which was about antibiotics and cancer. But that aside, her hysterical warnings about toxins, like most health care pseudoscience, has a kernel of truth. There are toxins in the environment, and it is plausible that some of them may reach levels that have health effects. We should be eternally vigilant about what substances we put into our environment and our bodies and monitor their health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand - toxicity is always about dose. Most substances decried as toxins are in such low doses that they likely do not have any health effects. For some we do need more evidence, and maybe even changes in policy. This is likely to be forever a moving target as technology and industry advances. Policy should be based on evidence - not vague fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, her use of the word “chemical” is misleading. The environment is loaded with naturally-occurring chemicals. We are made of chemicals. It is not enough to say that chemicals exist in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind all of this is to promote her health claims - that cleansing toxins has health benefits. That is an entirely separate claim that is not supported by evidence or much plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the claim that doctors and mainstream medicine kill patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while all of this looms and is largely unaccounted for in the standard health care equation, critics judge harshly alternative views and hail a system that’s been found to &lt;a href="http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.med.nutrition/2004-07/1225.html"&gt;kill almost 200,000&lt;/a&gt; people a year due to preventable errors. The same system has been found to kill another &lt;a href="http://www.pathlights.com/nr_encyclopedia/hn041598.htm"&gt;100,000 annually with drugs, and seriously harm another 2.1 million each year&lt;/a&gt; by the same means. They hail “proven” methods for cancer that are known to cause significant damage to the immune system, and are even known to be carcinogenic, which means to cause cancer. So, I ask, “Is this rational?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harriet Hall has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=136"&gt;already dealt with this claim&lt;/a&gt;.  First, it is a tu quoque logical fallacy. We all want better safer medicine. Failing to meet that goal in one arena does not justify pseudoscience in another. Further, these numbers are highly misleading (and almost certainly overstated) because they only consider the harm of intervention. But medical decision-making is about risk vs benefit. We need to know if the interventions in question save more people than they harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard in mainstream medicine is that each intervention should be backed by high quality evidence that its benefits outweigh its risks. Further, we are always trying to minimize risk whenever possible. And the principle of informed consent dictates that we give that information to patients and let them decide if the benefits outweigh the risks for them. Evan’s claimed treatments do not meet that standard, but she tries to distract from that criticism with the above non sequitur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, that’s exactly where we are &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;… So, in light of the numbers above and all of the proof that’s literally walking around next to us, maybe it’s time we started looking at and thinking about things a little differently. Because if a reliance on proven demonstrated science has gotten us exactly to the situation I describe above, perhaps a shift of focus to rational is the best move we can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the commenters for this entry pointed out that science-based medicine has doubled the human life expectancy - that is also part of the situation. But again - at least she is flying her anti-scientific flag high and proud. Evans wants us to abandon science at our whim, certainly long enough to buy her book. She  somehow twists logic to argue that this is “rational”, but she gets there only by abusing the evidence - by exaggerating risks and ignoring benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan’s rant, typical of those in her camp, is once again just another long rationalization for not wanting to play by the fair and honest rules of science because logic and evidence does not support her claims.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I've had quite a lot of you dropping by lately, wearing out the server carpet and generally making a mess of my database tables; and since you have miserably failed to click on ads or buy books from Amazon (no matter how cunningly I disguise the links), I thought maybe some of you could at the very least make yourselves useful by solving this little issue of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the problem. In my bathroom there is a light fixture, and in that fixture is a standard 60-watt light bulb - the ordinary bayonet kind, not the new-fangled Nazi death ray bulbs that the Daily Mail hate because they give you leprosy. That bulb is in what I am reliably informed is an electrical socket, encased in a sort of frosted glass bulb. By the door is a pull-cord, which turns it on and off. This paragraph contains roughly the full sum of my electronics knowledge - except for batteries, I know about batteries too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I walk into the bathroom and turn the light on, it starts flickering. If I then turn it off, then on again, it's absolutely fine. If I turn it off and on &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;, then it flickers again. if I turn it off and on &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;, it's fine again, and so on ad infinitum. How long the light has been on for seems to have little or no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent many hours last night stumped by this, repeatedly pulling the light cord, and it makes no sense to me. Eventually, housemates wanted to use the toilet. "Wait," I said, "I'm doing science," but eventually they insisted and so I retreated, defeated, to my lair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the sake of my sanity, can any of you bright young people shed any light (heh, what a pun) on this? &lt;b&gt;Why the hell does my bathroom light only turn on every second time you pull the cord?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best answer will win... er... free unlimited access to this blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Your posting [about &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1380"&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ambiguity&lt;/a&gt;] made me remember that I had a question, also involving ambiguity, though I think this one is quite a bit harder.  "Who was the first president born in the twentieth century?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;JFK was born 5/29/1917&lt;br&gt;
LBJ was born 8/27/1908&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Thus JFK was president first, but LBJ was born first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The sentence is, of course, a trivia question — it appeared in GAMES magazine. A reader wrote in to complain that the magazine had given the wrong answer (they said it was JFK). My view is that the question is genuinely ambiguous, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to argue for this conclusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In framing an argument that a certain phrase is &amp;quot;genuinely ambiguous&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;d start by looking for similar real-world examples such that in context, some of them are clearly (meant to be) interpreted in one of the two ways under discussion, while the others are clearly (meant to be) interpreted in the other way.  This isn&amp;#39;t a foolproof argument — some of the writers and readers might simply be &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1350"&gt;confused&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems to me to be a necessary if not sufficient condition for &amp;quot;genuine ambiguity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have to look far for examples where the temporal priority of &amp;quot;the first X born &amp;lt;in circumstances Y&amp;gt;&amp;quot; is interpreted with respect to the date of birth. Web search turns up &amp;quot;the first child born in Antarctica&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the first baby born after being conceived with a frozen donor egg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the first Anglo child born in Texas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the first aye aye born in captivity&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the first foal born on Robert Bonner&amp;#39;s Tarrytown farm&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the constraining circumstances are temporal or spatio-temporal, as in &amp;quot;the first baby born in 2009 at Northside Hospital&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s still purely the time of birth that matters. But in all these cases, &amp;quot;the first X&amp;quot; is an X from the moment of birth — a baby, a foal, an aye aye or whatever — and so there&amp;#39;s no competition from a salient event time associated with ascension to X-hood. This is not true when X is an optional status acquired later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;a href="http://januarythe20th.typepad.com/january_the_20th/2009/01/neuqu%C3%A9n-argentina-midday--1.html"&gt;Gregorio Álvarez&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;the first doctor born in Patagonia&amp;quot;, was born in 1889 and received his medical degree in 1919. And thus it could be the date of the medical degree rather than of the birth that is being calibrated — and indeed that&amp;#39;s how I (think I) interpret this phrase (not that I have any information about the alternatives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's one where we can tell: Wikipedia &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500_year_by_year#1920_to_1929"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that Frank Lockhart was &amp;quot;the first [Indianapolis 500] winner born in the 20th century&amp;quot; — he was born in 1903 and won in 1926, at the age of 23. And  in this case, we know (because Wikipedia also tells us) that Ray Keech, who won in 1929, was born May 1, 1900.  So it&amp;#39;s clear that the writer meant that among the winners, Lockhart was the first one with the property of having been born in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these last two cases of &amp;quot;the first X VERBed ADVERBIAL&amp;quot; — the first doctor born in Patagonia and the first Indy winner born in the 20th century –  it&amp;#39;s the date of  X-hood that matters, not the date of the VERB-ing. That agrees with the judgment of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Games&lt;/span&gt; magazine about "the first president born in the 20th century" being JFK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not always true that a phrase of the form "the first OPTIONAL-STATUS-NOUN VERBed ADVERBIAL" associates temporal priority with the date of the OPTIONAL-STATUS rather than the date of the VERBing.   When Physics Today told us that Steven Chu would be "the first Nobel Prize winner appointed to the US cabinet", it's the 2009  date of his cabinet appointment that mattered, not the 1997 date of his physics prize.  If  he were to be replaced as energy secretary in 2010 by Douglas Osheroff, who won the physics prize in 1996, Chu would nevertheless still be "the first Nobel prize winner appointed to the U.S. cabinet".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the key thing is which event is most salient in the context. Is it becoming a doctor, a president, a prize or race winner?  Or is it being born, being appointed to the cabinet, etc.? Or perhaps it also matters which of the two evoked events is later in time. I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this little exercise convinces me that phrases of this general type are in principle "genuinely ambiguous", although I feel that the original trivia question strongly biases the judgment in the direction of the date of becoming president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close with a trivia question from the history of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variants of the phrase "&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22the+first+dog+born+at+sea%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;The first dog born at sea&lt;/a&gt;" are often used in discussions of sense and reference, and especially with respect to definite descriptions. I recall Hilary Putnam using this phrase in a lecture 40 years ago (about why the verification theory of truth won't work, if memory serves). And a quick search on Google Scholar turns up e.g. Zoltán Gendler Szabó "&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u45417167377h784/fulltext.pdf"&gt;Descriptions and uniqueness&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Philosophical Studies&lt;/span&gt; 101: 29-57, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Clear uniqueness implications [of definite descriptions] occur in two sorts of cases: first, when we use expressions like ‘the first dog born at sea in this century’ or ‘the present king of France’, where the common noun phrase &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;without&lt;/span&gt; the definite article already guarantees or strongly suggests uniqueness; second, when we emphasize the definite article, as in ‘I found &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; solution to your problem’ and ‘&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; painter of the century has an exhibition in the Met’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again in Stephen Schiffer, "&lt;a href="http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/114/456/1135"&gt;Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Mind&lt;/span&gt; 114, 2005&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Let us say that the proposition &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;-expressed by (9) is the proposition that would be expressed by an utterance of ‘The F is G’ when ‘the F’ occurs as a ‘complete’ description, such as ‘the first dog born at sea’. Then the explicit theory holds that for any utterance of ‘The F is G’ there is some (possibly very complex) predicate H such that the proposition expressed by an utterance of ‘The F is G’ is the proposition &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;-expressed by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;(10) [the&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;: Hx ∧ Fx] x is G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;(in the limiting case, when ‘the F’ is uttered as a complete description, H is the null predicate).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are no dogs in Russell's "&lt;a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/%7Ecrshalizi/Russell/denoting/"&gt;On Denoting&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Mind &lt;/span&gt;14: 479-493, 1905.  So who invented this example, and when (and where) was it first used in print?

It turns out that according to the most in-depth survey on religious faith, &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-04-27-pew-religion-switch_N.htm"&gt;half of adults in the U.S. have switched religions at least once&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that may still be “a conservative estimate,” says Luis Lugo, director of the Pew Forum on Religion &amp;amp; Public Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pew’s new survey is based on re-contacting 2,800 people from its U.S. Religious Landscape Survey of 35,000 people, released last year. Pew estimated at the time that about 44% of Americans have changed religions. It now says between 47% and 59% have, if you count the millions who once switched but have returned to their childhood faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons most cited for the switch are that people didn’t feel their spiritual needs were being met, liked another faith more or changed their religious or moral beliefs. So basically, if I got this right, people are getting sick of the organized religions they were brought up in telling them how to think.&lt;/p&gt;

There's a change going on for me at work that has come unexpectedly. It's one of those changes that is, I am quite sure, ultimately for the ultimate good, but---just as changes aren't so easy for Charlie---so this one is slowly settling in with me. Don't worry, I most assuredly still have my job; it's just that some things are shifting and in ways that are (again) ultimately for the better and not only for me, but for things in general at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the sad feeling's there and, driving home with Charlie today---Jim had gotten him off the bus and met with Charlie's teacher for a home visit, and then they'd driven into Jersey City to my office---I realized that I'd had this feeling before. A feeling of a necessary change that portended a significant shift in the established order of things; a change that, I understood, must run its course, and it was up to me not to get stuck in wishing things could be the way they used to be, and direct my energies to moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say I've had a bit of practice managing these sorts of feelings in myself, from &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/i-dont-feel-that-i-suffer/"&gt;learning to accept&lt;/a&gt; that Charlie is autistic to reflecting on how autism in Charlie is connected to the various diagnoses, traits, conditions, what have you, of my own family and of Jim's. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_causes_of_autism_first_things_first"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; of Charlie being on the autism spectrum that makes the most sense to us is genetics and yesterday &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2009/ninds-28.htm"&gt;three new studies&lt;/a&gt; on the genetics of autism were reported. As noted by &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2009/ninds-28.htm"&gt;NIH News&lt;/a&gt;, all were genome-wide studies, which involve the scanning of the genome (the entire set of DNA) to identify differences (potentially small) between those who have a condition and those who do not. The largest study involved more than 10,000 participants, including individuals on the spectrum as well as their family members and volunteers across the US (you can access a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature07999.pdf"&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt; of the study, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature07999.pdf"&gt;Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders&lt;/a&gt;). As noted on &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/428/2"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, the three studies focus on DNA that had been previously overlooked in research on the genetics of autism; the new research highlights cell adhesion molecules, which play a roll in the connectivity and "wiring" of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a rift (understatement) about what causes autism, with people tending to believe that autism is something one is born with (and genetic), or that autism is something one "gets" (from an external agent). Jim and I do think that Charlie was born with autism; certainly we see more and more about him that is like us, and that connects him to us, every day, and I guess there is some of the sadness I mentioned at the start of this post in this. A parent thinks, what did I "give" to my child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I think, whatever happened, so it is, and sure there is sadness, but---for me now---fighting it off, in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_once_and_former_warrior_mom"&gt;warrior mother&lt;/a&gt; mode is not an approach to truly helps Charlie. But finding out how he learns---and learning about why that is, by studying neuroscience and genetics---does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2009/ninds-28.htm"&gt;NIH News&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the three new studies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; In [the first] study, Dr. [Hakon] Hakonarson [of the &lt;a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/"&gt;University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;] and his colleagues found several genetic variants that were commonly associated with ASD, all of them pointing to a spot between two genes on chromosome 5, called CDH9 and CDH10. Both genes encode cadherins – cell surface proteins that enable cells to adhere to each other. The researchers also found that a group of about 30 genes that encode cell adhesion proteins (including cadherins and &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autisms-cause-at-the-synapse/"&gt;neurexins&lt;/a&gt;) were more strongly associated with ASD than all other genes in their data set. In the developing brain, cell adhesion proteins enable neurons to migrate to the correct places and to connect with other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, Dr. [Margaret A.] Pericak-Vance completed an independent search for small genetic variants associated with ASD, in collaboration with Jonathan Haines, Ph.D., of &lt;a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/"&gt;Vanderbilt University Medical Center &lt;/a&gt;in Nashville. Published in the &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122368104/abstract"&gt;Annals of Human Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122368104/abstract"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; provides a striking confirmation that ASD is associated with variation near CDH9 and CDH10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are starting to see genetic pathways in ASD that make sense," says Dr. Pericak-Vance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a third study, reported in &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature07999.pdf"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, Drs. Hakonarson and Schellenberg led a search for genes that were duplicated or deleted in individuals with ASD. In the rare cases where those variations occurred, many tended to affect genes involved in cell adhesion. Others tended to affect genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a cellular waste disposal system that probably affects the turnover of adhesion proteins at the cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous, smaller genetic studies reported a connection between male-only autism and &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/cntnap2-an-autism-susceptibility-gene/"&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/a&gt;, a type of neurexin. Together, the three new studies suggest that genetic differences in cell-to-cell adhesion could influence susceptibility to ASD on a large scale. Dr. Hakonarson and his colleagues are planning an even more extensive genome-wide association study to gain a more complete picture of the genes and gene interactions involved in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/04/autism_linked_to_common_gene_variants_that_affect_the_connec.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;Not Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stands out to me about these studies is the findings about genetics and the brain, about the role of cell adhesion proteins in the functioning of neurons and in connecting neurons to other neurons. Whatever is said or observed about Charlie's cognitive abilities, if you spend time teaching him, communicating with him, playing the piano, you can see that he's absorbing everything around him. But making the connections about all of that and then making still more connections to communicate what he's observed, what he thinks about it, what he wants to tell us: At each of these junctures, it seems like something gets (if I may lapse into an electronics metaphor) short-circuited. "'We are starting to get convergence around genes that affect how synapses and connections in the brain are made and maintained ...,'" as &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/leadership.php#geri"&gt;Geraldine Dawson&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer for &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;, is quoted in &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1894409,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;. Is &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autisms-cause-at-the-synapse/"&gt;autism's cause at the synapse&lt;/a&gt;, as a July 13th &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5835/190"&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article asked? From the discussion section of the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature07999.pdf"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic findings, when coupled with anatomical and functional imaging studies, convergently indicate that ASDs may result from structural and functional disconnection of brain regions that are involved in higher-order associations, suggesting that ASDs may represent a neuronal disconnection syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However large these new studies are, "'they're still too small to nail down the major genes behind autism'" as Joachim Hallmayer, an autism genetics researcher at &lt;a href="http://med.stanford.edu/"&gt;Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; says in &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/428/2"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;. Various reports about the new studies such as one in the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/5237474/Gene-mutations-that-may-lead-to-autism-identified-by-scientists.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href="http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=2&amp;amp;ContentID=138814"&gt;The West Australian&lt;/a&gt; already mention that new treatments (such as drugs) and tests might be developed from these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report centred around the death of four week old &lt;a href="http://www.danamccaffery.com/"&gt;Dana McCaffery&lt;/a&gt; from whooping cough. The tragedy was Dana was too young to be vaccinated, but lived in an area of low herd immunity, resulting in her contracting the deadly pertussis bacteria. There is no cure for whooping cough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana’s parents, Toni and David made the brave decision to speak out to reporter &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/presenter"&gt;Rebecca Maddern&lt;/a&gt; of “Sunday Night”. What resulted was a wake-up call for parents who don’t vaccinate as we viewed footage of tiny babies with pertussis and heard of the heart break from the parents. Dana’s paediatrician, &lt;a href="http://www.nrdgp.org.au/columns/colleagues/colleague4548.html"&gt;Dr Chris Ingall&lt;/a&gt;, who was unable to save Dana, implored parents to vaccinate, not only to protect the lives of their own children but others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own anti-vaxers, the &lt;a href="http://www.avn.org.au/library/"&gt;Australian Vaccination Network&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;strong&gt;role is to “empower people everywhere to make informed health choices for their families and themselves”&lt;/strong&gt; were given some air time. Represented by Meryl Dorey, she stated that her mother used to just put her out with sick kids so she could get infected, and thereby gain natural immunity. She had this to say about measles and whooping cough;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You didn’t die from it 30 years ago and you’re not going to die from it today”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reporter Rebecca Maddern asked her; “What if one of your children got whooping cough? (to which she responded they had), “And did you seek help from the medical profession?”, she offered;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“No, we treated whooping cough homeopathically and none of us were sick for more than 2 weeks. My vaccinated children got it and my unvaccinated children got it. And none of us were sick for more than 2 weeks and it was nothing more than a bad cough”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This juxtaposed alongside footage of tiny babies with hacking coughs, gasping for air and barely able to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was intended to be &lt;em&gt;“..a wake-up message to parents about the vaccination debate which needs to end right now”&lt;/em&gt;. And it was. It was also a rare example of responsible scientific reporting, based on science and evidence. Although the anti-vaxers did get input, what they got was minimal and in the context of the tragedy of Dana, made them look rather irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was expected there has been an overwhelming response to Channel 7, both positive and negative. Some of the negative responses from the anti-vaxers has been published as part of a story called “Channel 7 - one-sided reporting” on the AVN website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual suspects have had an airing; vaccines have never been subject to double-blind clinical trials (wouldn’t that be unethical?); drug companies are not interested in our health, only money; drug companies pay millions of dollars a year to vaccine injured people; my child started exhibiting autism-like symptoms shortly after receiving the vaccine; vaccines are full of toxins (formaldehyde, mercury), you’ve heard it all before. One letter sent to Channel 7 had this to say; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Perhaps you can inspired by the organisation headed by actors Jim Carey &amp;amp; Jenny McArthy in and supported by shows much more renowned &amp;amp;  respected than yours such as OPRAH WINFREY &amp;amp; LARRY KING LIVE”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also encouraged as many people as possible to send positive feedback and many of you did (thank you). The response, both positive and negative, has been so overwhelming, that Channel 7 have agreed to have a “debate” on this week’s show. As a result of my congratulatory email sent to the show, I have been invited to be in the audience. I was informed by Channel 7 that Meryl Dorey will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be on the panel since they; “only want people with a scientific background”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, for the “positive” they have a paediatrician (I believe it is Dana’s) however, they are having trouble finding a doctor for the negative. Apparently all the doctors they have spoken to told them vaccination is a good thing, (go figure). I was also told that all the doctors consulted so far, assured the researcher there is no link between vaccination and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very positive response from a commercial television station, not previously known for their critical thinking and scientific approach to journalism. I only hope they do not cave into the screeching anti-vaxers in the meantime, and maintain their scientific-background requirement for panel members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep you updated as more information comes to hand. To watch Rebecca Maddern’s report in it’s entirety go &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-63XHXxTM4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In that piece, I wrote this paragraph:&lt;blockquote&gt;I could never be an SDA person because of the fact(s), namely: they hate gays - well, obviously; they don't drink (strike two); and they think "creation science" solves millions of years of evolutionary evidence. Gatdamn, I'd rather punch myself in the face for a year and a half than spend a minute in the presence of SDA weirdos in my home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The other day, one of the believers stopped in to my site, found said article and was, shall we say, offended by my accusations.  "Anonymous" commented thusly:&lt;blockquote&gt;I find it offense and clearly ignorant that you group the whole sda community in your objections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;your accusations are false and unfounded to a great extent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;show me proof from the bible or egw that we believe or have the traits that you have mentioned?&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'll leave the poor grammar and punctuation alone for the time being because there are more pressing issues.  I must defend my writing!  Okie dokie, here we go.  On the "hating gays" thing:&lt;blockquote&gt;Seventh-day Adventists believe that sexual intimacy belongs only within the marital relationship of a man and a woman. This was the design established by God at creation. The Scriptures declare: "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh" (Gen. 2:24, NIV). Throughout Scripture this heterosexual pattern is affirmed. The Bible makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships. Sexual acts outside the circle of a heterosexual marriage are forbidden...For these reasons Adventists are opposed to homosexual practices and relationships. &lt;a href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat46.html"&gt;(from here.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ooo, a stinging blow from the site of the Seventh Day Adventists themselves!  Sucks to be you.  Alrighty then?  Yes, I thought so.  Moving on to the "don't drink" accusation:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Seventh-day Adventist Church reaffirms its historic stand for the principles of temperance, upholds its policies and programs supporting Article 21 of the Fundamental Beliefs, and calls upon each member to affirm and reveal a life commitment to abstinence from any form of alcohol and tobacco and irresponsible use of drugs. &lt;a href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat26.html"&gt;(from here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jab and a hook!  He's looking tired, Goldie.  We good so far?  Righty O.  Lastly we have to deal with the SDA's alleged belief in "Creationism".  Hmmmmm, how about a selection from the SDA's &lt;a href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat54.html"&gt;"Affirmation of Creation"&lt;/a&gt; page?&lt;blockquote&gt;Reaffirmation of the church’s Fundamental Belief regarding creation is strongly supported.  Seventh-day Adventist belief in a literal and historical six-day creation is theologically sound and consistent with the teaching of the whole Bible...We affirm the historic Seventh-day Adventist understanding of Genesis 1 that life on earth was created in six literal days and is of recent origin...&lt;/blockquote&gt;Any questions, Anonymous?  I expect that you either have no idea what your religious organization actually believes or, perhaps, you are just as dumb as a fucking chimp clit.  Either way, I expect an apology soon - I will, however, be reading a large science book whilst I wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, and could you cretins please use fucking spell-check/grammar-check before you send your goddamn criticism?  Is that really asking so much?  If Jesus was on your side, HE'D check for you so you wouldn't sound like so much brainless blathering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to bed.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

Now religion already has been an elective class in Berlin schools ever since the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Pro Reli” campaigners, led by figures from the CDU of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and church leaders, want to change the regulations so that pupils can choose between ethics and a religion class, with Muslims, Catholics and Protestants being taught separately. “Pupils now have the choice between religion and free time - basically between religion and the ice-cream salon,” said Berlin’s leading Protestant bishop, Wolfgang Huber. “It is not really fair to say that pupils have a choice … Religion needs a proper place in the school timetable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, who needs Ethics class when you can learn a bunch of nonsense instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Pro Ethik” campaign is being spearheaded by the Social Democrats and the Left party, who make up Berlin’s city government. They argue that ethics teaching is central to ensuring integration in Berlin, which is now home to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;’s biggest Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s so awful about an ethics lesson in which everyone takes part?” asked Michael Müller, regional head of the Social Democrats. “Isn’t it a good thing that I learn something about my neighbour’s religion, his family and cultural background?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes sense to me. But of course the religious must play the old persecution card:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jauch, who is most famous for hosting the German version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, said: “Religious education in Berlin is systematically pushed to the edge of the curriculum and discriminated against on the school agenda. Whoever votes ‘yes’ [in favour of religious lessons] on Sunday, will be voting for the free choice between ethics and religion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You had to know a dopey celebrity would show up somewhere in this story. Now it surprises a lot of people that I am in favor of teaching religion in schools. However, I take the same position as Mr. Müller. We should be teaching children about many religions and reading from the many holy books as literature, as I did in an elective course I took in my final year of high school. In that class we might have been reading The Epic of Gilgamesh one day, Genesis the next, Antigone the day after that, and The Bhagavad Gita and Rig Veda then next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I don’t have much to say about this as it speaks for itself. Though I have to applaud Whoopi Goldberg who sort of sticks up for the atheists and says she wouldn’t have a problem if her child married an atheist and that children should be brought up to learn about many religions and schools of thought. She gets a gold star for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the others who wouldn’t want to “confuse” their child by exposing them to multiple points of &lt;strong&gt;“view”&lt;/strong&gt;, ironically something they’re allegedly doing every day on their show. But then again, the show isn’t called “The Views” and so they only have room for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by far the greatest offender here is Joy Behar, who mis-defines atheism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“an atheist is against theism, meaning there is no God. I don’t know that. Just like I don’t know that there is a God either…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, an anti-theist would be a person who is against theism. An atheist is someone who merely doesn’t hold theist beliefs. There’s a big difference between not believing in a god and believing their is no god. And although I happen to hold both positions, it is in no way a requirement for an atheist to actively believe that no gods exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005413" title=""&gt;Pure Ultrasonic Communication in an Endemic Bornean Frog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Huia cavitympanum, an endemic Bornean frog, is the first amphibian species known to emit exclusively ultrasonic (i.e., &amp;gt;20 kHz) vocal signals. To test the hypothesis that these frogs use purely ultrasonic vocalizations for intraspecific communication, we performed playback experiments with male frogs in their natural calling sites. We found that the frogs respond with increased calling to broadcasts of conspecific calls containing only ultrasound. The field study was complemented by electrophysiological recordings from the auditory midbrain and by laser Doppler vibrometer measurements of the tympanic membrane&amp;#39;s response to acoustic stimulation. These measurements revealed that the frog&amp;#39;s auditory system is broadly tuned over high frequencies, with peak sensitivity occurring within the ultrasonic frequency range. Our results demonstrate that H. cavitympanum is the first non-mammalian vertebrate described to communicate with purely ultrasonic acoustic signals. These data suggest that further examination of the similarities and differences in the high-frequency/ultrasonic communication systems of H. cavitympanum and Odorrana tormota, an unrelated frog species that produces and detects ultrasound but does not emit exclusively ultrasonic calls, will afford new insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate high-frequency communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005400" title=""&gt;Scaling of Soaring Seabirds and Implications for Flight Abilities of Giant Pterosaurs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The flight ability of animals is restricted by the scaling effects imposed by physical and physiological factors. In comparisons of the power available from muscle and the mechanical power required to fly, it is predicted that the margin between the powers should decrease with body size and that flying animals have a maximum body size. However, predicting the absolute value of this upper limit has proven difficult because wing morphology and flight styles varies among species. Albatrosses and petrels have long, narrow, aerodynamically efficient wings and are considered soaring birds. Here, using animal-borne accelerometers, we show that soaring seabirds have two modes of flapping frequencies under natural conditions: vigorous flapping during takeoff and sporadic flapping during cruising flight. In these species, high and low flapping frequencies were found to scale with body mass (mass−0.30 and mass−0.18) in a manner similar to the predictions from biomechanical flight models (mass−1/3 and mass−1/6). These scaling relationships predicted that the maximum limits on the body size of soaring animals are a body mass of 41 kg and a wingspan of 5.1 m. Albatross-like animals larger than the limit will not be able to flap fast enough to stay aloft under unfavourable wind conditions. Our result therefore casts doubt on the flying ability of large, extinct pterosaurs. The largest extant soarer, the wandering albatross, weighs about 12 kg, which might be a pragmatic limit to maintain a safety margin for sustainable flight and to survive in a variable environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005377" title=""&gt;Range Expansion Drives Dispersal Evolution In An Equatorial Three-Species Symbiosis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recurrent climatic oscillations have produced dramatic changes in species distributions. This process has been proposed to be a major evolutionary force, shaping many life history traits of species, and to govern global patterns of biodiversity at different scales. During range expansions selection may favor the evolution of higher dispersal, and symbiotic interactions may be affected. It has been argued that a weakness of climate fluctuation-driven range dynamics at equatorial latitudes has facilitated the persistence there of more specialized species and interactions. However, how much the biology and ecology of species is changed by range dynamics has seldom been investigated, particularly in equatorial regions. We studied a three-species symbiosis endemic to coastal equatorial rainforests in Cameroon, where the impact of range dynamics is supposed to be limited, comprised of two species-specific obligate mutualists -an ant-plant and its protective ant- and a species-specific ant parasite of this mutualism. We combined analyses of within-species genetic diversity and of phenotypic variation in a transect at the southern range limit of this ant-plant system. All three species present congruent genetic signatures of recent gradual southward expansion, a result compatible with available regional paleoclimatic data. As predicted, this expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of more dispersive traits in the two ant species. In contrast, we detected no evidence of change in lifetime reproductive strategy in the tree, nor in its investment in food resources provided to its symbiotic ants. Despite the decreasing investment in protective workers and the increasing investment in dispersing females by both the mutualistic and the parasitic ant species, there was no evidence of destabilization of the symbiosis at the colonization front. To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence at equatorial latitudes that biological traits associated with dispersal are affected by the range expansion dynamics of a set of interacting species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005372" title=""&gt;Modeling Statistical Properties of Written Text&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Written text is one of the fundamental manifestations of human language, and the study of its universal regularities can give clues about how our brains process information and how we, as a society, organize and share it. Among these regularities, only Zipf's law has been explored in depth. Other basic properties, such as the existence of bursts of rare words in specific documents, have only been studied independently of each other and mainly by descriptive models. As a consequence, there is a lack of understanding of linguistic processes as complex emergent phenomena. Beyond Zipf's law for word frequencies, here we focus on burstiness, Heaps' law describing the sublinear growth of vocabulary size with the length of a document, and the topicality of document collections, which encode correlations within and across documents absent in random null models. We introduce and validate a generative model that explains the simultaneous emergence of all these patterns from simple rules. As a result, we find a connection between the bursty nature of rare words and the topical organization of texts and identify dynamic word ranking and memory across documents as key mechanisms explaining the non trivial organization of written text. Our research can have broad implications and practical applications in computer science, cognitive science and linguistics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005316" title=""&gt;Distribution and Extinction of Ungulates during the Holocene of the Southern Levant&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The southern Levant (Israel, Palestinian Authority and Jordan) has been continuously and extensively populated by succeeding phases of human cultures for the past 15,000 years. The long human impact on the ancient landscape has had great ecological consequences, and has caused continuous and accelerating damage to the natural environment. The rich zooarchaeological data gathered at the area provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct spatial and temporal changes in wild species distribution, and correlate them with human demographic changes. Zoo-archaeological data (382 animal bone assemblages from 190 archaeological sites) from various time periods, habitats and landscapes were compared. The bone assemblages were sorted into 12 major cultural periods. Distribution maps showing the presence of each ungulate species were established for each period. The first major ungulate extinction occurred during the local Iron Age (1,200-586 BCE), a period characterized by significant human population growth. During that time the last of the largest wild ungulates, the hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), aurochs (Bos primigenius) and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) became extinct, followed by a shrinking distribution of forest-dwelling cervids. A second major wave of extinction occurred only in the 19th and 20th centuries CE. Furthermore, a negative relationship was found between the average body mass of ungulate species that became extinct during the Holocene and their extinction date. It is thus very likely that the intensified human activity through habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting were responsible for the two major waves of ungulate extinction in the southern Levant during the late Holocene.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005016" title=""&gt;Contact Networks in a Wildlife-Livestock Host Community: Identifying High-Risk Individuals in the Transmission of Bovine TB among Badgers and Cattle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The management of many pathogens, which are of concern to humans and their livestock, is complicated by the pathogens' ability to cross-infect multiple host species, including wildlife. This has major implications for the management of such diseases, since the dynamics of infection are dependent on the rates of both intra- and inter-specific transmission. However, the difficulty of studying transmission networks in free-living populations means that the relative opportunities for intra- versus inter-specific disease transmission have not previously been demonstrated empirically within any wildlife-livestock disease system. Using recently-developed proximity data loggers, we quantify both intra-and inter-specific contacts in a wildlife-livestock disease system, using bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in badgers and cattle in the UK as our example. We assess the connectedness of individuals within the networks in order to identify whether there are certain 'high-risk' individuals or groups of individuals for disease transmission within and between species. Our results show that contact patterns in both badger and cattle populations vary widely, both between individuals and over time. We recorded only infrequent interactions between badger social groups, although all badgers fitted with data loggers were involved in these inter-group contacts. Contacts between badgers and cattle occurred more frequently than contacts between different badger groups. Moreover, these inter-specific contacts involved those individual cows, which were highly connected within the cattle herd. This work represents the first continuous time record of wildlife-host contacts for any free-living wildlife-livestock disease system. The results highlight the existence of specific individuals with relatively high contact rates in both livestock and wildlife populations, which have the potential to act as hubs in the spread of disease through complex contact networks.

&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who is responsible for keeping health care infrastructure or other state resources in good working order, however, the ethical landscape of a major flu epidemic looks quite different.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/ethics_in_planning_for_a_flu_p.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/ethics_in_planning_for_a_flu_p.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/kiakkWPLyjk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240983437710"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=1078">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ded08794f044c760</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="Australian Vaccination Network"/><category term="AVN"/><category term="Channel 7"/><category term="Meryl Dorey"/><category term="Sunday night"/><title type="html">Anti-vaxers update</title><published>2009-04-29T05:36:35Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T05:36:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/ant-vaxers-update/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a call from channel 7 this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher for the Sunday Night programme, Stephen Tucker invited me to be in the audience for the debate that will constitute this Sunday’s show. This is in response to the substantial negative feedback Channel 7 received accusing the story of bias, one-sided journalism, badly researched, etc etc. You know the drill (you can see details of some of the correspondence &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/29/anti-vaxers-the-story-so-far/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or go to the Australian Vaccination Network website and search for channel 7). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held my breath as I asked him who was going to be on the panel and he said a paediatrician (I think he said the one who looked after Dana) but Meryl Dorey was not invited. To my surprise and relief, he said they only wanted people with a science background on the panel. Furthermore, they were having a hard time finding a Dr who thought vaccinations were bad. He relayed to me, out of those he had called, some had mentioned there could be some more research, but they all stated there was no link between vaccinations and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reiterate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meryl Dorey will not be on the panel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel 7 only want people with a science background on the panel&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel 7 are having trouble finding a doctor to say that vaccination is bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope they stand their ground on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be on the audience, please take the time to familiarise yourself with the anti-vaxers tactics. There is a link &lt;a href="http://avn.org.au/library/index.php/taking-action/channel-7-responses.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to the AVN’s response to the story. In brief they use conspiracy theories, screech about toxins in our vaccines, refer to Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, Oprah and Larry King Live as credible sources, and exclaim that as educated well research parents, they demand a CHOICE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard it all before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the time to read this. It’s an invaluable tool for preparing yourself with the neccesary information to counter their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies looked at the DNA of 12,000 families, making it the largest autism gene study ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, scientists have identified specific genetic mutations that lead to specific abnormalities in how brain cells communicate and carry messages in the brains of those with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The genes that were discovered appear to be involved in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain … that is, involved in complex behavior such as social behavior and also abstract thought,” said Dr. Geri Dawson, chief officer of Autism Speaks and co-author of the study. “So it helps us understand why people with autism have difficulty in the area of social interaction — and also why they have a tendency to be so concrete and literal in their interpretation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this won’t stop the autism deniers’ spin machine from just shifting their claims again to accepting the genetic involvement but insisting that a trigger (i.e. vaccines) are necessary. And while theoretically autism symptoms might require an environmental trigger, we now know with nearly absolute certainty that it isn’t vaccines and Occam’s Razor renders the hypothesis of an environmental trigger unnecessary as genes are on their own a sufficient explanation. So it seems to me that our goal should be to seek out ways of modifying the genes to weed out the autism genes altogether rather than perpetuate unnecessary hysteria as to what, if anything, is the environmental trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we’re going to defeat autism, with science and not quack medical treatments and bizarre diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just the same way that Kim Evans apparently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/kim_evans_strikes_again_at_huffpo.php"&gt;doesn't know that there was no such thing as a flu vaccine during the 1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Michelle Bachman apparently doesn't know that the swine flu scare of 1976 occurred when Gerald Ford was President. In case Bachmann doesn't remember, Gerald Ford was a Republican. True, he was far too moderate politically ever to fit into today's Republican Party, but he was a Republican. Heck, he was even a mainstream Republican.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about the swine flu scare that brings out the loony conspiracy-mongering in people? And don't even get me started on an e-mail by a certain well-known pediatrician to the stars' children and apologist for the anti-vaccine movement that's been circulated. If I choose to discuss it, the full e-mail (a brief version of which has appeared--where else?--in the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/tamiflurumsfeldh1n1-redux_b_191606.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;) would "deserve" an entire post of its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/burning_stupid_from_michelle_bachmann.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/vrU4C5B2eNg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240981683970"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/the_110th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b471fd1517035f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">The 110th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle</title><published>2009-04-29T05:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T05:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/J6lwYa2DmfI/the_110th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/the_110th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/what_happened_to_the_skeptics_circle.php"&gt;confusion over last week's Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt;, I've been totally remiss in doing what I normally do, namely plugging the next host and urging all skeptical bloggers to start getting ready their best skeptical stuff for the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt;, which is next scheduled for May 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating article here from Nielsen on Twitter’s stickiness (or relative lack thereof). This is exactly why I feel like Twitter may be a bit of a fad. Facebook makes you want to come back every day, but if you miss a few, its no big deal. Twitter makes you feel like you have to come back multiple times every day or you’ll miss everything. It quickly becomes less like fun and more like work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp upward slope at the end might seem encouraging, but it might also be due to the relative recency of their mainstream success. I guess we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Here (for the time being, at least) is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_0RO9kKYTc"&gt;YouTube clip&lt;/a&gt; bringing together the three-part sketch and one outtake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the YouTube clip could very well be taken down soon if FOX gets wind of it, here's a helpful summary from &lt;a href="http://www.planetmadtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10409"&gt;Planet MADtv&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionary Words #1&lt;br&gt;
				Glenn (Keegan-Michael Key), and Gene (Crista Flanagan) come up to tell the new changes to Webster’s Dictionary has to add new words that have becomes staples in American speech. These words include ba*donk*a*donk (n): A large and formidable posterior, and but*ter*face (n): A woman who is considered attractive for everything but her face. Along with these new additions will be the shortening of other words like totally to totes (abr), seriously to f*reals, and Laughing out Loud to just LOL (v).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				Dictionary Words #2&lt;br&gt;
				Webster's Dictionary has now gathered again to update the change in phrase of some words. These words include slut, whore, and bitch (n) which now stands for a term of endearment between 2 drunk girls, served (v) which now means getting busted on by a wicked dancer, and wick*ed (adj) now means extremely awesome. Along with these changes include words like dra*ma (n) which now encompasses even the mundane. Bro is now a verb which means sex between 2 male best friends. The last change is to the word lit*er*al*ly (adj) due to the fact that people now use it to mean everything but literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				Dictionary Words #3&lt;br&gt;
				Gene asks Glenn why they must rape the dictionary so. Glenn answers &amp;quot;because they are Americans&amp;quot;. They then announce the following words that have now been removed due to their neglect amongst the US population. These words include sav*ings (n), ab*stain (v), pa*tience (n), rag*time (n), soc*cer (n), De*troit (n), cy*ber*space (n), E.R (the show. NBC), and books (n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few if any of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; words or senses reluctantly admitted by the fictional lexicographers should be too surprising to anyone paying attention to contemporary American usage — though the suggestion of &lt;i&gt;brew&lt;/i&gt; as the past tense of the verb &lt;i&gt;bro&lt;/i&gt; was a new one on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sketch derives its humor from the idea that the super-dignified Webster&amp;#39;s crowd is being forced to include slangy and nonstandard terms as &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; (and defining those terms in stuffy dictionary style). But it&amp;#39;s not just Urbandictionary that keeps tabs on such usage: scholars of slang pay close attention to the latest colloquialisms and are hardly horrified by them. For instance, you&amp;#39;ll find &lt;i&gt;butterface&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cassell's Dictionary of Slang&lt;/i&gt; (Jonathon Green, 2005) and &lt;i&gt;badonkadonk&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&lt;/i&gt; (Tom Dalzell &amp;amp; Terry Victor, 2006). &lt;i&gt;Badonkadonk &lt;/i&gt;even got a long exegesis in the pages of the New York Times in 2006, from a Kelefah Sanneh &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/arts/music/10sann.html?_r=1"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about Trace Adkins&amp;#39; surprising country hit, &amp;quot;Honky Tonk Badonkadonk&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Only a few years ago “badonkadonk” was considered strictly hip-hop slang — sly onomatopoeia for the imaginary sound made by a decidedly nonimaginary asset. It was used by the African-American comedian Tracy Morgan, as the single-minded Spoonie Luv, on Comedy Central’s “Crank Yankers.” Missy Elliott played with the pronunciation when she rapped, “Keep your eyes on my ba-bump-ba-bump-bump/And think ya can handle this ga-donk-ga-donk-donk.” And the rapper Twista tried to cash in with a song called “Badunkadunk” in early 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				The word was a black thing, and so, went the implicit logic, was the thing it described. The term evoked both black culture and black anatomy: like the concept of race itself, “badonkadonk” was a mishmash of nurture and nature. (Though Spoonie Luv never described it that way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the least compelling part of the sketch was the usual litany of complaints about &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/002611.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (And not just because they misspelled it as &lt;i&gt;litterally&lt;/i&gt;.) "MADtv" has already been there, done that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RAIww1VRY7Y%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was one in a series of &lt;i&gt;literally &lt;/i&gt;sketches starring Nicole Sullivan and Michael McDonald that ran on "MADtv" in 2004 (&lt;a href="http://www.planetmadtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4388"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.planetmadtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4760"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.planetmadtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5193"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.planetmadtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4763"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Naturally, the sketches got props from the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002581.html"&gt;peevebloggers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://literally.barelyfitz.com/2008/08/07/literally-mad-tv/"&gt;Literally, A Web Log&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the appearance of &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; in the dictionary sketch was intended as a bit of peevish nostalgia for devoted fans as the show nears its swansong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240975447674"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/04/xfce-is-annoying-me-maybe-il/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78f5539ea978d0ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">xfce is annoying me, maybe I’l…</title><published>2009-04-29T02:43:36Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T02:43:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/04/xfce-is-annoying-me-maybe-il/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;xfce is annoying me, maybe I’ll switch back to !gnome for a bit&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240974330303"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1116773671750469377">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1d8d699640c7a9bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Christians Converting Christians to Christianity</title><published>2009-04-29T01:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T01:28:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/fVYDnBsJWyo/christians-converting-christians-to.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1116773671750469377/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1116773671750469377" title="29 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/christians-converting-christians-to.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">From 1983-85 I worked in electronics with a Bob Jones University ministerial graduate who was getting support for the mission field. His country of choice was the Pacific nation of Guam; a country where over 90% of the population is Roman Catholic or, as he put it: &lt;em&gt;Over 90% are lost. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The excerpts below are from several of his news letters to his mission board and supporting churches. In them he shares a few of the burdens the Lord has laid on his heart to win the Catholic false religionist to Christ:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have almost finished another door-by-door visit through the village of Agat. Many of the doors are posted with Catholic signs that clearly state that they are not interested in any other “religion”. Never the less we keep sowing, praying and watering and trust the Lord of the harvest to bring forth fruit. We are very thankful for those that He has brought in and rescued from the religion that the devil has used to blind their eyes. Our old folks’ home ministry is also still going well. God keeps the door open though we preach strong doctrinal messages that contradict the predominant religion of the residents. A few have professed faith in Jesus Christ.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That village is on the southern tip of Guam and has about 2,000 folks living there. Please pray that the hearts of the folks will be receptive to the gospel since it is very strong Catholic. During the meeting there was one soul saved. In the past month one of our members had the blessing of leading a niece to the Lord and a daughter to confirm her salvation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I am sad to report that a Catholic lady Doris and I had witnessed to many times over the past five to six years went into eternity last week and to our knowledge she had not been saved. &lt;strong&gt;What a price to pay to be loyal to a false religion!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1116773671750469377?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president Jimmy Carter, and I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some cases it does, especially if science is being carelessly mangled or deliberately distorted. But in many cases communicators are passionate about science and are simply trying to communicate it as clearly as they can to as large an audience as possible. We risk drowning out what's good with a stream of public bickering. We also risk discouraging a new generation of communicators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/"&gt;worked in a role&lt;/a&gt; trying to bridge the gap between scientists and journalists, I think Sykes has a point. Scientists can be incredibly intolerant of any kind of simplification of their work, often because they don't appreciate the depth of their knowledge compared to the ubiquitous 'man on the street'. It's always going to be be frustrating to be told that glaring omissions and simplifications are "irrelevant" to the wider understanding of a story - but a newspaper isn't an academic journal and it's foolish to expect the same standards of reporting in both. However, it might surprise some scientists to discover that often the journalists and film-makers themselves wish they could cover science in more depth. The sad fact is that boosting the level of intellectualism is met with diminishing returns with regards to the audience reached (though often the media grossly underestimate the public appetite for solid, informative science). This is in no way a &lt;em&gt;carte blanche&lt;/em&gt; for the media to be outright misleading in the name of reaching an audience, and New Scientist itself has come under much-deserved criticism for it's summation of horizontal gene transfer: &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="darwinwaswrong.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/darwinwaswrong.jpg" width="150" height="197"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Touching upon this, Sykes seems to argue that in this case the ends justified the means - if it was a cheap trick to sell magazines, it worked, and ultimately more people gained a better understanding of evolution (and that Darwin wasn't wrong at all). Meanwhile, T. Ryan Gregory at &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/scientists-about-media-put-up-or-shut.html#comments"&gt;Geonomicron&lt;/a&gt; argues that the cover gives ammunition to Darwin's detractors. I disagree with both: I doubt the cover made a meaningful impact on either side of the evolutionary debate (if it can be called that) simply because: it's a cover. If you expect to see accurate reportage in a single three-word sentence on the front cover of a popular science magazine, you're in dreamland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like a black-and-white photo of a Rothko painting, science passed through the media lens is never going to be reproduced perfectly - and journalists already know this. Rather than despatching lab-coated lynch mobs every time a less-than-perfect article appears in print, scientists would be better placed to attack with full venom the wilfully ignorant, and those who set out to intentionally distort science. Sykes herself was embroiled in just such a case where she presented a patient undergoing open-heart surgery with only acupuncture to stop the pain. It &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/3344833/Did-we-really-witness-the-amazing-power-of-acupuncture.html"&gt;was later revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the patient was also benefiting from a barrage of more conventional treatments:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;in addition to acupuncture, the patient had a combination of three very powerful sedatives (midazolam, droperidol, fentanyl) and large volumes of local anaesthetic injected into the chest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Sykes know? Probably not. But someone involved in the program did, and chose instead to present an entirely misleading view of acupuncture. In times like this, the full scorn of the scientific establishment isn't just justified, it's to be encouraged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science in the media can be glib, but it should never be misleading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/scientists-about-media-put-up-or-shut.html#comments"&gt;Genomicron&lt;/a&gt; for blogging Sykes' article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/04/kathy_sykes_on_science_and_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~4/_eq_P-MMbuU" height="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240969638114"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/04/i_like_my_women_how_i_like_my.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82e644dfa322710a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">I like my women how I like my oatmeal</title><published>2009-04-24T18:22:28Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T18:22:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~3/TAXtIU_tUv8/i_like_my_women_how_i_like_my.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lefthandedtoons.com/"&gt;&lt;img alt="drew_howilikemywomen.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/drew_howilikemywomen.gif" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mmm...

A panel of speakers from across the herbal remedies industry stated that while they supported the MHRA&amp;#39;s Herbal Directive in principle, some felt it was too stringent and expensive in requiring companies to prove their products were safe, effective and consistent before granting a full licence. Lynn Lord of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naturesaid.co.uk/"&gt;Natures Aid&lt;/a&gt; bemoaned the fact that registering a herbal medicine to the new licence could cost up to &lt;em&gt;£50,000&lt;/em&gt;! Wow, who thought making medicine could be so expensive?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Herbalandhomoeopathicmedicines/Herbalmedicines/PlacingaherbalmedicineontheUKmarket/TraditionalHerbalMedicinesRegistrationScheme/index.htm"&gt;Herbal Directive&lt;/a&gt; is an attempt by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to bring the burgeoning market of herbal remedies under its control. There are two different standards to which a herbal remedy can aspire. &lt;strong&gt;Licensed herbal medicines&lt;/strong&gt; are held to similar standards as other medicines, and are required to show evidence of safety, effectiveness and quality. Sellers of &lt;strong&gt;registered traditional herbal medicines&lt;/strong&gt;, by contrast, aren't required to prove that their medicine actually works - they just need to show that the remedy is safe and has been in use for 30 years, 15 of which must be in Europe. However, even this proved too onerous for some:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;[Greer Deal asked if the] panel thought it would make a difference if this rule was amended or even removed altogether. The panel were united in their response: yes, this one amendment would make a significant difference to the herbal industry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well they would say that - clearly these people are salivating over the near limitless supply of new, ineffective medications that could be sold if the 15/30 rule was abandoned, or extended to include other hubs of quackery such as India and China. &lt;p&gt;The MHRA has come under a lot of criticism for the Herbal Directive, which many feel established a two-tier system where some medicines are held to higher standards than others, and gives a Governmental seal of approval on what is essentially quackery. I would like to think that the MHRA will slowly tighten the noose on herbal medicines, eventually requiring all to be full licensed, but given their stated commitment to the Blairite mantra of 'patient choice', I won't hold my breath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/04/proving_our_products_are_safe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~4/FNLKz3cJiiA" height="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240967352013"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7104">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8b87d239570c3c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><title type="html">Beer, Bullshit &amp;amp; Brains</title><published>2009-04-29T00:45:07Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T00:45:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7104" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago, I was asked by a group of rowdy drunken young men to join them one evening on their podcast - &lt;a href="http://beerbullbrains.blogspot.com/"&gt;Beer, Bullshit and Brains&lt;/a&gt;. It was great fun. I got to listen to them review beers (Beer), talk about sciencey skeptical stuff (Bullshit), then I lectured them on why it’s not okay to shoot cats with potatoes (Brains). It was a seriously fun time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re a gossling of a podcast right now, having recorded only 4 episodes as of today. Which gives me a unique opportunity to offer you a great deal! Right now, for a limited time, I can give you episode 4 at no charge, and if you love it, we’ll throw in the first three episodes absolutely free!&lt;/p&gt;

book. I haven't decided whether I want to spend this much time on
logics; they're really interesting and fun - but there's lots of
other interesting and fun stuff, and there's only so much space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The topic of the moment is temporal logic - that is, a logic which
is built for reasoning about things that change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To begin with, why do we want temporal logic? Most of the time,
when we want to use logical reasoning, we use predicate logic. So why
do we need another logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Sir,Madam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you doing.My name is Charles Xxxxxxx I will like to make enquires of forklift.Also i will like to know the kinds of creditcards you accepts as mathod of payment.When i know all this before i can go head with my order.Thank you very much i hope to hear back from you as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Regards&lt;br&gt;
Charles Xxxxxxx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resisting the urge to send him a quote and the address of my PayPal account, I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Charles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not sell or rent fork-lifts at layscience.net. In spite of our website's apparent resemblance to an industrial vehicle rental service, we are in fact a popular science blog, and fork-lifts just aren't part of our business. We may however start selling T-shirts soon, and some of these may have fork-lifts on them, although I can't promise anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours,&lt;br&gt;
Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has quickly gained reputation as one of the top medical journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000072" title=""&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; published last night, the Editors look back at the five years so far, and also look forward into the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the age of the Internet, five years can seem like an eternity. PLoS Medicine issued its first call for papers five years ago and the inaugural issue went live online five years ago this October--for those of you who are nostalgic, check out the original call for papers [1]. Anniversaries often prompt reflection, and over the past few months we've taken a close look at our original plans for PLoS Medicine, what's happened since the journal launched, and most importantly how the journal should evolve in the future. We now propose a refocusing of the journal's priorities that will, we believe, align them more closely with the world's health priorities...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/28/new-evidence-based-approach-for-plos-medicine/" title=""&gt;the vision for the future&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The PLoS Medicine editors also emphasize the need to look beyond just the biological causes of disease. As the world faces up to the challenges of a changing climate, a turbulent economic system, continued global conflict - and now a possible influenza pandemic - they now wish to reinforce the important place in health research of work that encompasses the social, environmental, and political determinants of health, as well as the biological.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/plos_medicine_is_five.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/mDw2pRu3dcc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240962050063"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_363.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81c55ae5da2e3439</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-04-28T22:32:14Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T22:32:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/VyI_oB7iQbY/todays_carnivals_363.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_363.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grand Rounds Vol. 5 No. 32 are up on &lt;a href="http://sixuntilme.com/blog2/2009/04/grand_rounds.html" title=""&gt;Six Until Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/obama/"&gt;President Obama addressed the National Academies of Science yesterday.&lt;/a&gt;  If anyone doubted that change has come, and come to science, they need to watch this video.  We’ve been waiting a long, long time for a president to take this kind of interest in furthering the cause of science in our country.  His budget calls for a doubling of our nation’s investment in basic research in the coming years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one can predict what new applications will be born of basic research: new treatments in our hospitals; new sources of efficient  energy; new building materials; new kinds of crops more resistant to heat and drought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was basic research in the photoelectric effect that would one day lead to solar panels. It was basic research in physics that would eventually produce the CAT scan. The calculations of today’s GPS satellites are based on the equations that Einstein put to paper more than a century ago….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We double the budget of key agencies, including the National Science Foundation, a primary source of funding for academic research, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which supports a wide range of pursuits - from improving health information technology to measuring carbon pollution, from testing “smart grid” designs to developing advanced manufacturing processes. And my budget doubles funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science which builds and operates accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, high-energy light sources, and facilities for making nano-materials. Because we know that a nation’s potential for scientific discovery is defined by the tools it makes available to its researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, started by New Jersey homemaker Jeannie Baker in August of last year, currently consists of Jeannie, Jeannie’s best friend Luanne Watkins, and a man listed only as Steve. Displayed in the group’s photo section are nearly three hundred pictures of Jeannie and Luanne’s cats, Monsieur Muffin and Señor Whiskers respectively, as well as a number of drawings of cats by Steve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama, upon learning of the secession, reacted by ordering an immediate review of the groups submitted secession paperwork. “I immediately put my best people on this,” Obama explained. “But after a thorough review, it’s all there and the administration’s hands are tied on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constitutional scholar Mort Fishbein agrees. “This isn’t the first time a small group of organized citizens has left the Union. Of course we all learned a powerful lesson from Reagan’s 1983 thermonuclear strike on the Greater Newark Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Club. Diplomacy is really the way to go here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When told of the groups secession, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed regret but also understanding. “I can’t say I didn’t see this coming. My girlfriend told me that one day my free-access social networking website was going to end up tearing this nation apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

When my son was younger, I often found myself saying that he had "special needs" and was in "special ed." "Special" was a codeword for Charlie being "different" and, at that time, these terms seemed the best way for me to explain about him to any strangers; to the other parents who were waiting to pick up their children outside the school.  Over the years, with Chariie &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simplex_elegans_growing_boy_growing_needs"&gt;growing older&lt;/a&gt;, I've spoken more and more of him as having "disabilities" and being "disabled," with "special needs" striking me more and more as terms more in use for children (though it is used &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2009/04/24/20090424biz-specialneeds0425.html"&gt;reference to adults&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which do you use? In your experience, are different terms used more in reference to children and others to adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might say that this is just a matter of words and semantics. Being the mother of a boy of limited (but powerfully expressed) words, I've learned that even the smallest syllable uttered, not to mention a single word, can change the meaning of everything.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240952283925"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-4743998794491343143">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/13acddb807e0c685</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A quickly bashed out manifesto, if I were to have such a thing</title><published>2009-04-28T20:29:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T20:29:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/04/quickly-bashed-out-manifesto-if-i-were.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Le Canard Noir)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml</id><title type="html">the quackometer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240951554328"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2790709250519592584">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c54cce3f3425d3c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Are You as Smart as a Second Year University Student?

The answer proffered is that without earthquakes, "the planet couldn't support creatures like us." Here's my response:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see nothing in the natural order of things that could not be fixed by God through perpetual miracles. As far as the theist is concerned the laws of nature are just that anyway, perpetual miracles. As David Hume wrote, the ordering of the world by natural laws "seems nowise necessary for God." And if divine hiddenness is invoked then there would be no one who would ever conclude God was involved if the Indonesian tsunami did not take place, precisely because it didn't happen. I wonder if Christian theists have really thought through the implications of a God who prefers the present set of natural laws that exist over constant divine miraculous maintenance. Is God lazy or something? What is there that is more valuable to God about this present ecosystem that takes precedence over human suffering? Besides, it seems obvious and even noncontroversial that the more power and influence someone has to avert suffering then the more that person has a responsibility to do something about it. If all it took was a “snap” of the fingers for God to stop that underwater earthquake which caused the Indonesian tsunami that slaughtered a quarter of a million people, then an omnipotent God is to be ultimately blamed for not doing so. And if God’s so-called “reason” for not doing so is to control over-population then a much better population control method would be to reduce our mating cycles in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click for the &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/may/12.58.html?start=1"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[First posted 4/28/09]&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2396668116877170119?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m happy to let you know that our very own Hive Overmind — Discover Magazine, that is — is sponsoring &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/contests/evolution-in-two-minutes-or-less/"&gt;a contest for readers to create a two-minute video about evolution&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/a_video_contest.php"&gt;they picked some squid as one of the judges&lt;/a&gt;, but don’t let that stop you. Just include &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2006/cthulhu_kitty.jpg"&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt; to make him happy and you’re a shoo-in, guaranteed!&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#tentaclenote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short recap for those stumbling upon Skepchick for the first time: homeopathy is nothing more than regular water, shaken up and packaged in boxes covered in lies and sold to people who don’t know any better. For a more thorough overview, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=101"&gt;see this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark, an official Friend of Skepchick, tweeted us a link to &lt;a href="http://www.helios.co.uk/swine_flu.html"&gt;this ridiculous site&lt;/a&gt; trying to sell homeopathic remedies by capitalizing on the world’s panicked reaction to outbreaks of swine flu. Here are some highlights (bolding mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important for those more at risk to seek professional help from their homeopath&lt;/strong&gt;, GP or health practitioner now. Constitutional treatment is the best way for anyone to strengthen the immune system and Helios would recommend consulting a homoeopath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, no. Just . . . no. If you are “more at risk” to have a deadly infectious virus, like you just got back from a pig-licking tour of Mexico* where you were repeatedly sneezed on, then you should see a real medical professional. Homeopaths do not necessarily have medical degrees and all they can do is give you sugar water and then maybe contract swine flu from you and then you can die in one another’s arms, just like Romeo and Juliet only &lt;em&gt;stupider&lt;/em&gt;, which is really saying something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present we do not have a nosode, i.e.a remedy made from the disease material. However, we do have existing remedies which have been used successfully over many years to treat all stages of flu. These are safe for everyone from babies to the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man I am so hoping they manage to get their hot little hands on a vial of swine flu so they can bust that sucker open and dilute the crap out of it until they have their extra special magic water, which they can then drink to cure the swine flu they just gave themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, feel free to self-treat your deadly, human race-ending disease with a variety of other products, all of which are actually just water and therefore are, in fact, perfectly safe for everyone from babies to the elderly. Until they all die of the swine flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homoeopathy has a long history in the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That part is true. Back when hospitals were rife with infectious diseases and visiting the doctor was more likely to cause you harm than good, sitting at home and drinking a glass of water was a much better way to stem the spread of a virus. In fact, sitting at home and doing just about anything was better, but of course one should always stay hydrated. While you die of the swine flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That about sums up the total amount of good homeopathy has done for infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However it must be stressed that there is at present only anecdotal and bibliographical evidence that homoeopathic prophylaxis works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! As the old joke goes: What do you call alternative medicine that works? Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who are worried about swine flu: skip the homeopathy, stay clear of crowded public spaces, wash your hands, talk to a doctor if you have symptoms, and calm the frig down because getting riled up is only going to weaken your immune system more. Oh, the irony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.adapt.org/cca.php"&gt;Community Choice Act&lt;/a&gt;, which enables people who need long term support to get the services they need &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to have the right to choose where they want to live, would finally provide &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rally_against_institutionalization"&gt;a way out of institutions&lt;/a&gt; and nursing homes.  It would give those of us who need long term support to have the same thing that every other citizen has: the choice to live in the community.  It would break some of the terrible &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_two_faces_of_government_programs"&gt;bureaucratic catch-22s&lt;/a&gt; that prevent people with disabilities from working, or enjoying a high quality of life, or choosing where to live.  It would enable the Supreme Court ruling that inappropriate institutionalization is discrimination in violation of the &lt;a href="http://ada.gov"&gt;ADA&lt;/a&gt; to be upheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after meeting with the Obama administration, &lt;a href="http://adapt.org"&gt;ADAPT&lt;/a&gt; says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said very clearly that they would rather see people with disabilities in institutions, that they would leave them there, because there were higher priorities for this Administration," said Bruce Darling from Rochester, "this is a civil rights issue and they need to see this as a civil rights issue. No other group of people get locked up in institutions and nursing homes just because of who they are. We are making it clear to the President that this is not acceptable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darling characterized the Administration health care policy as "betrayal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betrayal indeed, recall &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/my_hope_of_a_better_day_equality_quality_and_inclusion"&gt;the message about equality and inclusion&lt;/a&gt; Obama once gave to people with disabilities.  In fact, it's even a big reason why &lt;a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/07/john-mccain-on-disability-you-cost-too.html"&gt;many of us voted for him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My heart is broken," said Dawn Russell, ADAPT organizer in Denver, Colorado. "Throughout the Presidential campaign, ADAPT worked hard to educate the Obama campaign. We came to believe in the Obama promise of 'change,' and we really believed that President Obama was the person who really would 'free our people' from being imprisoned in nursing homes and other institutions. Untold numbers of people have died or been abused waiting for their freedom, and we just got told we aren't important enough and so we have to keep waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not acceptable.  Obama administration: Do better.  Now.&lt;/p&gt;

But last week, they managed to do something that many well-established local skeptical groups don’t manage to accomplish.  They took down a quack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found out that a known snake-oil salesman &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://breastcancercured.com/"&gt;Robert Dowling&lt;/a&gt; was coming to Jackson to try to sell his fake cancer cure, something he calls the Quantum Health Management screening process. According to the site, all cancer is caused by ‘cavitations;’ holes in the jawbone that are sometimes caused by poor dentistry. Not only are the dentists of the world plotting against us with cancer, but also the FDA and the American Cancer Society are all ignoring the evidence and blah blah blah.. ugh… I can’t even summarize without feeling nauseous. Just go read the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/ncit.html"&gt;Quackwatch article&lt;/a&gt; about it for Stephen Barrett’s summary of why Dowling is, well, a quack. Barrett also has &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cavitation.html"&gt;information on the ‘cavitations’ or oral pathology&lt;/a&gt; that Dowling claims is the root cause of all cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when this clown showed up peddling his nonsense, Patrick Jerome of the Jackson Skeptics put out a &lt;a href="http://jacksonskepticalsociety.wordpress.com/2009/04/19/hot-skeptical-action/"&gt;call to action&lt;/a&gt;.  Read the rest after the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their plan: research the heck out of this guy, attend his talk, ask a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of questions.  Six of them attended the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were polite. They were non-confrontational. They were very, very patient.  They listened to Dowling’s presentation for two hours.  They listened to him rail about how he had discovered a cure for cancer. How traditional medicine and drug companies were refusing to see the truth because they couldn’t make enough money off this cure. How oral pathology caused cancer as well as heart disease and alzheimers. How traditional medicine came from Nazi experiments. And so on.  Then it was the skeptics’ turn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the steaming piles of pseudoscience flew right and left, the skeptics in attendance asked our questions: what bacteria cause this? Why would doctors cover up a cure for cancer? What studies have you done? Where were they published? How long have you followed your patients? Are you a doctor? We asked far more questions than the rest of the audience combined, even though they outnumbered us six or seven times. I doubt that Randi, Dennis, Brad, Don and I were the only ones skeptical of his claims – but we were the only ones voicing that skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowling did not have our answers. After claiming to have published studies, after claiming a 100% cure rate, after calling himself a doctor, he said that he had the proof. And when we asked for it, we got dodgy answers, evasions, and even the confession that he was not in fact a doctor. Of course, he was only a few semesters away from a medical degree in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to &lt;a href="http://jacksonskepticalsociety.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/robert-dowling/"&gt;read the whole story&lt;/a&gt; on the Jackson Skeptical Society web site.  It’s fairly awesome. But the best part is that the story isn’t over.  Patrick also got in touch with the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure and found them very interested in his story.  They issued a cease and desist order on Dowling and effectively shut down his operation in Mississippi. If he is caught practicing in Mississippi again, he’ll be arrested. And the Jackson Skeptical Society will be keeping an eye out for him.  They’re also not resting on their laurels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Dowling isn’t based in Mississippi. In fact, it’s a little difficult to figure out where he is based.  I spent a few hours today researching it myself and found websites and companies based in North Carolina, South Carolina and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that this story is over.  We’re doing more research, trying to find out as much as we can and to report this guy to the FDA, the Better Business Bureau and anyone else we can find.  If you hear about him in your town or if you find out any information, please contact us either through Skepchick or at the Jackson Skeptical Society site so we can follow up.  I’ll post more as I know it. In the meantime, go Mississippi Skeptics.  You guys &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;rock&lt;/span&gt; bluegrass &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240934956717"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/dont_forget.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/040dedca623ffbd8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Don't forget!</title><published>2009-04-28T16:20:39Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T16:20:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/_QMOs0BbWfA/dont_forget.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/dont_forget.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You all remember that I'm &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/id_really_like_to_win_an_ipod.php"&gt;trying to win an iPod Touch from Eric Hovind&lt;/a&gt;, right?

Jerry Coyne set a few people on fire with a post arguing that &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/"&gt;national science organizations have gone to far in blithely conceding the compatibility of science and religion&lt;/a&gt;. He strongly suggests that they stick to complete neutrality on the topic, something they all promise to do, but then ignore what they say to tout a philosophical accommodation that doesn't really exist. He does not argue that they should go the other way and advance an atheistic position (even though &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; know that that is the only correct stance), but wants them to back off on the misleading happy religion stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/generals-who-do.html"&gt;Richard Hoppe fired back&lt;/a&gt; with a claim that nuh-uh, they aren&amp;#39;t pushing a particular religious view, and besides, we need concessions to religion in order to get along politically…and then he threw in a lot of tactless and politically self-destructive accusations about how ivory tower atheists don&amp;#39;t know a thing about politics or tact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/foot_soldiers_who_lack_vision.php"&gt;I responded to that&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out in the NCSE&amp;#39;s defense that they are an indispensable element in protecting our classrooms, but that the US is currently deadlocked in the evolution/creationism struggle, and has been for a long time…and that central to the stalemate is our constant abasement to religion. It&amp;#39;s time to stop, and the atheists are the ones who are working to break that logjam. At the same time, I agree that the NCSE, to be politically useful, &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; to be neutral on the issue of religion. The problem is that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was lots of piling on. Check out &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/04/pz-on-accommodationism.html"&gt;Russell Blackford's take&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/04/science_and_religion_for_indiv.php"&gt;Wilkins' mild disagreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2009/04/endorsing-compatibility-of-science-and.html"&gt;Taner Edis takes a strange position&lt;/a&gt;: the incompatiblists are completely right, but we can't say so. You can guess that &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/foot-soldiers-and-generals.html"&gt;Larry Moran didn't waffle&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/27/atheists-for-common-cause-with-the-religious-on-evolution/"&gt;Chris Mooney gets it all completely wrong&lt;/a&gt;, accusing Coyne of claiming that the national organizations are &amp;quot;too moderate on the extremely divisive subject of religion&amp;quot;, when what he and I are actually saying is the exact opposite — that they aren&amp;#39;t moderate enough, and have drifted too far towards appeasing religious views. I shall repeat myself: no one is demanding that the NCSE and NAS go all rabidly atheist, and we can even agree that a neutral position is more productive towards achieving their goals. The problems arise when they get so entangled with the people they should be arguing with that they start adopting some of their views, and suddenly the science is being compromised to achieve a political end.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Now to make it even more interesting, &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/let-me-try-agai.html"&gt;Richard Hoppe has put up a partial retraction&lt;/a&gt;. He concedes that in some cases the NCSE &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; drifted too far into promoting a particular religious view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its Faith Project, then, I think that NCSE has gone beyond its remit and past where it can be effective. I now think — in agreement with Coyne, PZ, and others — that it should back off from describing particular ways of reconciling science and religion. Pointing to religious people and organizations who have made their peace with science and evolution is appropriate, but going past that to describing particular ways of making that peace is a mistake. NCSE ought not wade into theological swamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to see some progress in the argument (and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/the-dust-settles-a-little-at-pandas-thumb/"&gt;Jerry Coyne sends his regards&lt;/a&gt;, too). The ultimate point, I think, is that we all think the NCSE is a marvelous organization — you should &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/membership"&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&amp;#39;t already — but that does not mean it is above criticism, and some of us are seeing signs of the incipient Templetonization of the group, something we&amp;#39;d rather not see happen. If it is to be useful to both the religious and the infidels, it can&amp;#39;t wander too far to one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/weekend_update.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/an_a9LyWGdk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240931551001"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/is-something-amiss-with-jay-gordon-md.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e4696a2c65fdb91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism and Quackery"/><category term="Vaccination"/><title type="html">Is Something Amiss With Jay Gordon, MD?</title><published>2009-04-28T14:12:35Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T14:12:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/is-something-amiss-with-jay-gordon-md.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jay Gordon, MD, FAAP  left a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php#comment-1592853"&gt;comment at Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt;  April 27th that left many wondering if something was wrong with his thinking apparatus.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php#comment-1595038"&gt;The second comment&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#39;t improve matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph at Natural Variation wrote: &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-jay-gordon-caught-making-stuff-up.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon Caught Making Things Up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Gordon posted a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/tamiflurumsfeldh1n1-redux_b_191606.html"&gt;curious little article at Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; that is related to this comment at Respectful Insolence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s up about that swine flu email that is going around signed by you?

The news in them is old, you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get entire multipage sections that you don't want, they use up trees and gasoline, they crowd your mailbox and you have to dispose of them after reading them. And they cost money! News should be read on-line, preferably with an RSS reader. (I use &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com"&gt;Google's&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here's something for my Swedish readers. The country's main newspapers, &lt;em&gt;Dagens Nyheter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Svenska Dagbladet&lt;/em&gt;, currently don't offer a finely sorted selection of thematic RSS feeds. If I want the main international news headings from them, then I have to put up with a load of pointless sports stories and local murder cases as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, our friends on the front side of the country, &lt;i&gt;Göteborgs-Posten&lt;/i&gt;, have &lt;a href="http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=777&amp;amp;a=190593"&gt;a set of sorted feeds&lt;/a&gt;.

Jerry Coyne set a few people on fire with a post arguing that &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/"&gt;national science organizations have gone to far in blithely conceding the compatibility of science and religion&lt;/a&gt;. He strongly suggests that they stick to complete neutrality on the topic, something they all promise to do, but then ignore what they say to tout a philosophical accommodation that doesn't really exist. He does not argue that they should go the other way and advance an atheistic position (even though &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; know that that is the only correct stance), but wants them to back off on the misleading happy religion stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/generals-who-do.html"&gt;Richard Hoppe fired back&lt;/a&gt; with a claim that nuh-uh, they aren&amp;#39;t pushing a particular religious view, and besides, we need concessions to religion in order to get along politically…and then he threw in a lot of tactless and politically self-destructive accusations about how ivory tower atheists don&amp;#39;t know a thing about politics or tact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/foot_soldiers_who_lack_vision.php"&gt;I responded to that&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out in the NCSE&amp;#39;s defense that they are an indispensable element in protecting our classrooms, but that the US is currently deadlocked in the evolution/creationism struggle, and has been for a long time…and that central to the stalemate is our constant abasement to religion. It&amp;#39;s time to stop, and the atheists are the ones who are working to break that logjam. At the same time, I agree that the NCSE, to be politically useful, &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; to be neutral on the issue of religion. The problem is that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was lots of piling on. Check out &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/04/pz-on-accommodationism.html"&gt;Russell Blackford's take&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/04/science_and_religion_for_indiv.php"&gt;Wilkins' mild disagreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2009/04/endorsing-compatibility-of-science-and.html"&gt;Taner Edis takes a strange position&lt;/a&gt;: the incompatiblists are completely right, but we can't say so. You can guess that &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/foot-soldiers-and-generals.html"&gt;Larry Moran didn't waffle&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/27/atheists-for-common-cause-with-the-religious-on-evolution/"&gt;Chris Mooney gets it all completely wrong&lt;/a&gt;, accusing Coyne of claiming that the national organizations are &amp;quot;too moderate on the extremely divisive subject of religion&amp;quot;, when what he and I are actually saying is the exact opposite — that they aren&amp;#39;t moderate enough, and have drifted too far towards appeasing religious views. I shall repeat myself: no one is demanding that the NCSE and NAS go all rabidly atheist, and we can even agree that a neutral position is more productive towards achieving their goals. The problems arise when they get so entangled with the people they should be arguing with that they start adopting some of their views, and suddenly the science is being compromised to achieve a political end.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Now to make it even more interesting, &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/let-me-try-agai.html"&gt;Richard Hoppe has put up a partial retraction&lt;/a&gt;. He concedes that in some cases the NCSE &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; drifted too far into promoting a particular religious view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its Faith Project, then, I think that NCSE has gone beyond its remit and past where it can be effective. I now think — in agreement with Coyne, PZ, and others — that it should back off from describing particular ways of reconciling science and religion. Pointing to religious people and organizations who have made their peace with science and evolution is appropriate, but going past that to describing particular ways of making that peace is a mistake. NCSE ought not wade into theological swamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to see some progress in the argument (and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/the-dust-settles-a-little-at-pandas-thumb/"&gt;Jerry Coyne sends his regards&lt;/a&gt;, too).

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I was informed, to my profound disappointment and frustration, that Channel 7 received such an overwhelming response to the pro-vax story on Sunday night, the next show will be a forum. This is apparently a result of the “other side” complaining that their story was not heard, so they have demanded a debate in their defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so angry and frustrated that I actually cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientifically, there &lt;strong&gt;IS NO DEBATE&lt;/strong&gt; about vaccination. I thought this point was brought home by the report from Rebecca Maddern about the death of 4 week old Dana McCaffery. Whilst we have science and evidence, they have conspiracy theories, hearsay, scaremongering and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight is not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Sydney, the debate will be filmed this Saturday, May 2 and &lt;a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunday-night/"&gt;Sunday Night&lt;/a&gt; are looking for audience members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;Foxtel  Television Centre, 5 Thomas Holt  Drive, North Ryde. Hosted by Mike Monroe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When: &lt;/strong&gt;12.30pm until  2pm&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; Stephen Tucker at STucker@seven.com.au to reserve your place in the audience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all those who have helped this story get out there, thank you. As per my previous post, please Twitter, Facebook, blog, tell your friends but get to Saturday’s debate if you can. Thanks for your support, Rachael&lt;/p&gt;

In any case, the NP Hotel (also known as the N.P. Hotel), on 6th Ave. S. in Seattle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a recent photo, but the sign on the side of the building is of some vintage; you can't expect to find a room there for 50 cents. In fact, it's not a hotel now, but low-income housing (renovated, along with a number of other hotels in the International District, in the 1970s), so it's properly referred to as the "NP Hotel building". The building is in a historically Japanese section of the city, and there's now a Japanese restaurant (Maneki) in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;NP&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;NP Hotel&lt;/em&gt; doesn't stand for Noun Phrase, or for that matter Nondeterministic Polynomial. It's the Northern Pacific Hotel, a railway hotel built in 1914. Nevertheless, I like to think of it as a place where you can get a first-class noun phrase for only 50 cents.&lt;/p&gt;

They have finally made a significant contribution to a science…in this case, computer science. Behold the &lt;a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/intelligentdesignsort.html"&gt;awesome power of the Intelligent Design Sort&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intelligent Design Sort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent design sort is a sorting algorithm based on the theory of intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Algorithm Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of the original input list being in the exact order it's in is 1/(n!). There is such a small likelihood of this that it's clearly absurd to say that this happened by chance, so it must have been consciously put in that order by an intelligent Sorter. Therefore it's safe to assume that it's already optimally Sorted in some way that transcends our naïve mortal understanding of "ascending order". Any attempt to change that order to conform to our own preconceptions would actually make it less sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is constant in time, and sorts the list in-place, requiring no additional memory at all. In fact, it doesn't even require any of that suspicious technological computer stuff. Praise the Sorter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feedback&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Rogers writes:&lt;br&gt;
Making the sort constant in time denies the power of The Sorter. The Sorter exists outside of time, thus the sort is timeless. To require time to validate the sort dimishes the role of the Sorter. Thus... this particular sort is flawed, and can not be attributed to 'The Sorter'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heresy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a kind of universal argument, too — just replace the word &amp;quot;list&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;gene&amp;quot;, and it transforms into their usual assertion about biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_discovery_institute_should.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/U0RrDtHVo9Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240927449078"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_so_disappointed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0957f3e316afa8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">I am so disappointed</title><published>2009-04-28T13:57:03Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T13:57:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/GOg535ew680/i_am_so_disappointed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_so_disappointed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090427/SPT0106/904280359"&gt;lawsuits between Carl Wieland and Ken Ham have been settled out of court&lt;/a&gt;. In case you hadn't been following it, both were originally members of the same creationist organization in Australia; Ham emigrated and set up the American branch; they drifted apart and for years have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/schism.php"&gt;sniping acrimoniously&lt;/a&gt; at each other. It's been quite fun to watch, and I would have loved to see it move into a courtroom where all of Ham's sleazy tactics would have had wriggle in the light of day. What little we've seen has been very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation Ministries had for years criticized Answers in Genesis on Web sites and in e-mails for its financial dealings and its approach to creationist teaching. Wieland also accused Ham and others of trying to take control of his organization, stealing mailing lists and spreading false and vicious rumors about him and his ex-wife.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"It is astonishing that respected leaders of Christian organizations would stoop so low as to resort to gutter tactics of the kind mentioned here to besmirch the character of Wieland," wrote Clarrie Briese, who in 2007 led a commission of Australian religious leaders that investigated the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to disagree on one point: it isn't astonishing at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_so_disappointed.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/GOg535ew680" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240927325892"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9811">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/848da54ac08ea07c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="recession"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Recession Culture: Old Is the New New</title><published>2009-04-28T13:42:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T13:42:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/recession-culture-old-is-the-new-new/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We've told you about recession music, recession comfort, and depression cooking.

Trust me, I take no great pleasure in doing so. Indeed, more than anything else, it's been a major frustration for me. It's bad enough that HuffPo has been a hotbed of anti-vaccine propaganda and pseudoscience &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;ever since its very inception&lt;/a&gt;, continuing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/the_huffington_post_and_vaccines.php"&gt;through to today&lt;/a&gt;. Ditto Deepak Chopra, who has had a home there for at least three years now. But 2009 has been especially bad, adding proponents of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php"&gt;distant healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/more_woo_on--where_else--the_huffington.php"&gt;detox quackery&lt;/a&gt;, and, worst of all, the stylings of Kim Evans, a detox maven who thinks that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fresh_from_huffpo_antibiotics_cause_canc.php"&gt;antibiotics cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It's not clear whether this is due to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt;HuffPo's new "Wellness Editor," Patricia Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, or whether it's just an acceleration of a tendency that's been there from the beginning, but the addition of Kim Evans and her detox quackery to the already toxic woo brew at HuffPo signals a new low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to Evans to sink HuffPo to even lower levels still. She does so in a rapid fire series of two posts, first &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/health-care-scientific-or_b_190680.html"&gt;Health Care: Scientific or Rational?&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/swine-flu-protect-yoursel_b_191550.html"&gt;Swine Flu: Protect Yourself and Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;.

It had passed gas clouds, tenuous patches of dust, interstellar and then even intergalactic space. It had blasted through countless atoms and unimaginable stretches of space and time, and now the light had been reduced to a mere echo of its once epic luminosity. But it was enough…  after spending the age of the Universe careening through it, those few remaining photons finally saw something blocking their path that they couldn’t barrel their way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Swift satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, after billions of years, in the early hours of Thursday, April 23, these electromagnetic bullets slammed into Swift’s gamma-ray detectors. And when they did, they signaled the detection of the most distant discrete object in the Universe ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gemini.edu/furthestgrb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/gemini_grb090423a1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gemini telescope detection of GRB 090423A.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamma-ray burst GRB090423A, as it’s now called, not only breaks but completely &lt;em&gt;destroys&lt;/em&gt; the previous record holder. In astronomical parlance, it has a redshift of 8.2, meaning the light from this burst has been traveling for more than 13 billion years! The previous most distant GRB was seen &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/19/swift-bags-most-distant-titanic-explosion-ever-seen/"&gt;only just last September&lt;/a&gt;, but this new one is nearly &lt;em&gt;200 million&lt;/em&gt; light years farther away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow.&lt;/strong&gt; Not too long ago, the most distant objects we had seen and been able to measure were quasars, galaxies spewing out huge amounts of radiation. The record holders were at (what seems now to be measly) redshifts of 5 or 6, corresponding to 12 billion light years away or so. But then gamma-ray bursts came on the scene, and blew away those distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://swift.sonoma.edu"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; is a satellite designed to detect these distant blockbusters, and has recorded the fading light from over 30 GRBs so far this year, and several hundred since its launch in 2004. I worked on the education and public outreach for Swift for several years, and I remember very well when we bagged a redshift 7 burst, blowing away the previous record. It was around then that I started to suspect that we might actually see much farther ones, even out to a redshift of 10 (nearly 13.2 billion light years). This detection of GRB 090423A indicates that’s no pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artwork of a GRB at the moment of truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gamma-ray burst happens when a massive star — maybe as much as 100 times the mass of the Sun — explodes in a supernova. We’re not exactly sure why, even now, but the forces in the heart of this beast can focus the energy of the explosion into two beams of cosmic destruction; vast death rays blasting out from the core. The energies are beyond belief, dwarfing even the Sun’s total emitted energy &lt;em&gt;over its entire lifetime&lt;/em&gt;. Any planet in that beam’s way within a few thousand light years of the burst is in for some serious hurt (which I lovingly detail &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;in my book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I doubt that happened for 090423A. When it went off, the Universe itself was only 630 million years old! There probably weren’t enough heavy elements to make earth-like planets, though I suppose gas giants might have been around by then… but even the first stars themselves were hardly more than 200 million years old at that time. It’s hard to imagine what the Universe must have looked like when it was so young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding such ancient gamma-ray bursts is crucial in understanding what the early cosmos was like. We can find out what proportion of elements existed in stars back then, and the way the light is absorbed by intervening dust and gas tells us about them as well. We know precious little from this era of the Universe, because any object in it was sp far away at the time that they are essentially invisible. Only the titanic brightness of a GRB allows us to see them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star that exploded to form this GRB was probably not among the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; first in the Universe to be born; even 230 million years is a long time compared to the lifetime of those extremely massive stars, which may have exploded after living only a million years or so. But it may have been born in the second generation, stars that formed from gas blown out by the explosions of those first stars. If so, we’re one step closer to seeing what the very first objects in the Universe were, and how they behaved. That’s a mystery that has been on the minds of many astronomers for many years, and Swift is whispering to us that we’re almost to the point where they are within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transgenic kernels contained 169-fold the normal amount of β-carotene, 6-fold the normal amount of ascorbate, and double the normal amount of folate. Levels of engineered vitamins remained stable at least through to the T3 homozygous generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s precursors to vitamins A and C, and vitamin B9 respectively.  This is the first time a GM crop has been enhanced with more than one vitamin. The GM corn needs to go through the testing process, however, including animal testing for safety. It will likely be years before this corn is growing in the fields of sub-Saharan Africa - it’s intended target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course - we’re talking about GM food, so there is going to be controversy. I will state my bias up front (i.e. what follows is purely my opinion) - I think genetic modification of crops is a perfectly reasonable technology. It is potentially a powerful tool, and like all the powerful tools science has placed in our hands, it needs to be used with caution. Of course there are risks - just as there are risks with piping explosive gas into our homes, operating nuclear power plants that can melt down, and speeding along highways at 60 mph where one mistake can mean death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - like all such issues, there is hysteria and pseudoscience on both sides. Corporations likely have their eyes more on the potential profits than the potential risk and will tend to oversell claims. While the anti-GM food groups exaggerate risks and downplay benefits.  Somewhere in the middle there is a balance where GM foods can be beneficial, if used with caution. GM opponents serve a useful purpose in forcing governments and corporations to ask the tough questions and raise the bar on safety. But beyond a certain point they become obstructionist, needlessly hampering a useful new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically modifying food involves inserting genes into a plant or animal, typically to give them a trait they currently lack. This type of modification has been done to make crops droubt resistant or pest resistant, and has also been used to increase the nutritional content of food. There are also efforts underway to create a peanut that does not cause allergies. Here is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food"&gt;list of currently available GM crops.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders of GM technology point out that modifying plants and animals by humans has been going on for thousands of years. Just about all the plants we grow and consume have been radically altered from their naturally evolved states. Plants in particular are amenable to hybridization, where genes from one related species can be combined with another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analogy is limited, however, because with modern GM technology genes can be taken from a bacteria and inserted into a grain crop.  This type of transfer is actually possible in nature - for example by viral vectors. But with GM technology gene transfer can be immediate and targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8020925.stm"&gt;Dr. Christou argues&lt;/a&gt; that his new GM corn is geared toward the malnourished in poor countries, where many people cannot afford a varied diet. In many parts of the third world people live on a limited number of staple grains, and lack variety in their diets. They are therefore susceptible to vitamin deficiencies. Therefore, enhancing the nutritional value of a staple crop could alleviate much malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Asia, for example, blindness from vitamin A deficiency is common. This has lead to the development of so-called &lt;a href="http://www.goldenrice.org/"&gt;golden rice&lt;/a&gt;, which has enhanced levels of beta-carotene. Rice can already produce beta-carotene, but only in the husk, not in the consumed part of the rice. By inserting three genes into white rice scientists have turned on the beta-carotene production in the rice grain istelf, giving the rice a golden color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GM Critics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8020925.stm"&gt;BBC article discussing this new corn&lt;/a&gt;, Clare Oxborrow from Friend of the Earth is quoted as the GM skeptic.  It’s important to note that such articles rarely do justice to a person’s complex position, but with that caveat she does raise the typical concerns over GM crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Oxborrow said it was “virtually impossible” to contain GM crops and to be sure that all the people eating them were getting the correct dose of what they had been modified to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary argument of opponents to GM crops is that they are too risky becauses it is impossible to contain them. The new genes they contain may contaminate other crops or wild plants, with unintended consequences. This is a legitimate concern, although it is not clear how much of a risk this really poses. For genes that confer resistance to pests or herbicides I can see why this would be a real concern - we do not want to create super weeds. But for genes that enhance nutritional content it seems that the risk would be quite low. What is the risk from nutritionally-enahanced weeds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretical risks revolve around unintended consequences, such as creating a crop that has more potential to induce allergies, or affecting the natural food chain. What will the effect be on the animals who eat the weeds that are now modified by GM genes? I think these are good questions, but to me they equal proceeding with caution, not abandoning GM technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxborrow also plays down the potential benefits of GM crops:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than opt for “expensive, untested and potentially risky GM technofixes”, she said “research efforts would be better placed ensuring that people are able to grow, or otherwise have access to, a diverse range of foods that will give many other health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Oxborrow said golden rice, fortified with vitamin A, had been available for many years but was still not widely used or commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of the perfect being the enemy of the good. Sure, wouldn’t it be great if the entire world had access to the variety of food we enjoy in the US and other industrialized nations.  And of course there should be efforts to improve food availability in the third world. But let’s be realistic - there are real-world economical, political, and logistical reasons why there are still billions of people with inadequate access to nutrition in the world, and no one is going to solve these complex problems anytime soon. Nutritionally enhanced staple crops is a partial fix only, but it can significantly improve the situation and reduce diseases of nutritional deficiency that place an even further burden on poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also obstacles to implementing the use of GM crops, such as golden rice. I am actually not sure why it has not been more widely adopted. Perhaps it is resistance to GM foods or the slowness of regulatory agencies. GM critics argue it is simply the greed of corporations, who create GM foods primarily to maintain their monopoly. There is probably some truth to all of these claims, but I have not found a convincingly definitive answer (and would welcome any informative links).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, the &lt;a href="http://www.goldenrice.org/"&gt;Golden Rice Humanitarian Board&lt;/a&gt; claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who need the product of this new technology most are those who can least afford buying a mixed diet, rich in essential nutrients. This has been taken into consideration by the creators of &lt;em&gt;Golden Rice&lt;/em&gt; technology, Professors Peter Beyer and Ingo Portrykus, and the crop  						protection company Syngenta, who have donated it for humanitarian use in developing countries, free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Dr. Christou claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Christou told BBC News: “Our research is humanitarian in nature and targets impoverished people in developing countries. This specific project is targeted towards sub-Saharan Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “Our funding is exclusively from public sources so we are not encumbered by any commercial constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cynic could argue that this is PR by an industry with a troubled reputation.  Perhaps, but human behavior is rarely one-dimensional. Most corporations engage in charity for the PR benefit, but the people in those corporations also probably have charities they really care about and want to think of themselves as good people and good corporate citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let the GM food industry engage in a little humanitarian aid, putting their technology primarily to the purpose of enhancing the nutrition of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GM controversy is one of those heated topics that I find very challenging to completely wrap my head around. Like recycling, organic farming, and even global warming - the science is complex, the claims made on both sides are complex, and the vast majority of information available to a non-expert like myself seems tainted by bias. I find it hard to get to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of GM food I think part of the reason for this is that there really are legitimate points on both side of the issue. Perhaps the risk/benefit is close to the line. Perhaps the technology has not yet advanced enough for the benefits to clearly outweigh the risks or expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find the concept of GM food to be reasonable, and many of the products that are already on the market seem to have clear advantages and to be commercially viable. This technology has great potential.  I also find that many of the arguments against GM food are ultimately rooted in a visceral reaction against anything artificial or corporate. I find their arguments less compelling and logical. For example, arguing that a more nutritious variety of corn is not a good thing, as Ms. Oxborrow did, seems like ideological advocacy to me and not a reasoned position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I acknowledge that my current position on this topic is tentative pending further exploration of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;My friend and I are avid Language Log readers. We were recently conversing over IM, and she was telling me about her boyfriend's great-aunt. Among the things she mentioned:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"She worked when women didn't work very much and never got married."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I interpreted her statement as my friend alluding to a time when women both didn't work and did not get married. After a few moments, I realized she was telling me that the great-aunt had a job and never got married; "when women" only modified "didn't work very much." We are unsure which reading is technically correct and therefore decided to ask.   Any insight you could provide would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a syntactician, but I usually take the morning shift here at Language Log Plaza, so I&amp;#39;ll do my best with this one — luckily, it seems pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You&amp;#39;re right that the two readings depend on two alternative structures, but it&amp;#39;s probably not helpful to think about what &amp;quot;when women&amp;quot; modifies — the two words &amp;quot;when women&amp;quot; are not a syntactic unit, and their relation to the rest of the sentence doesn&amp;#39;t involve what grammarians usually mean by &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the two readings that you describe depend on a difference in which verb phrases &lt;span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; is taken to conjoin. On both readings, "never got married" is the second conjunct. The first conjunct might be "worked when women didn't work very much" (in which case the subject of both conjuncts is &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;), or it might be "didn't work very much" (in which case the subject is &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;women&lt;/span&gt;). Your friend meant the first of these alternatives, while you (at first) understood the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we put in just the relevant pieces of the trees, and aren&amp;#39;t too fussy about node labels — I&amp;#39;m not a syntactician, remember — the difference is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(A)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Tree1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(B)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Tree2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both structures are perfectly grammatical, and thus both interpretations are "technically correct", though perhaps the paired negatives "didn't" and "never" make your misinterpretation (B) easier than it should be. A simple way to prevent this problem would be to add a comma and another copy of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;, thus creating a conjunction of sentences: "She worked when women didn't work very much, and she never got married".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not hard to find plausible examples of both types of structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A) We saved when times were good and used that to tide us over in lean seasons.&lt;br&gt;
(A) I read it when I was in high school and never forgot it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(B) It almost broke my heart when he died and left me there alone.&lt;br&gt;
(B) I started designing costumes when I was in high school and worked at a costume shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjunctions &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; are often technically ambiguous, but we usually don't notice it because the context or the content makes it clear what was meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recipe tells us to "Beat ripe bananas and sugar together until smooth", we know that it means "[ripe bananas] and sugar", because ripeness is not a concept that applies to sugar. In contrast, when we read that we should "Store ripe peaches and nectarines in the refrigerator", we interpret the instructions as dealing with "ripe [peaches and nectarines]", because why would you refrigerate unripe fruit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the sentence that you asked about, real-world knowledge about the history of sex roles tells you that interpretation (B) doesn't make sense. But by the time you saw the problem, it was too late to avoid a conscious boggle.&lt;/p&gt;

So the news &lt;i&gt;du jour&lt;/i&gt; regarding the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/tag/causes/"&gt;causes of autism&lt;/a&gt; (which I used to keep track of &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/tag/causes/"&gt;when I wrote at Autism Vox&lt;/a&gt;) is........ have fewer firstborn children. Or, as a post in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/forget_vaccines_maybe_we_can_lessen_autism_having_fewer_firstborn_children"&gt;Scientific Blogging&lt;/a&gt; puts it, "&lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/forget_vaccines_maybe_we_can_lessen_autism_having_fewer_firstborn_children"&gt;Forget Vaccines - Maybe We Can Lessen Autism By Having Fewer Firstborn Children&lt;/a&gt;---which is to say, have fewer children, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/forget_vaccines_maybe_we_can_lessen_autism_having_fewer_firstborn_children"&gt;Scientific Blogging&lt;/a&gt; reviews a recent study by researchers at the &lt;a href="http://medicine.utah.edu/"&gt;University of Utah School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/5/1293"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which is published in the April 27th &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, looked at children who were firstborn or breech or whose mothers were 35 or older when giving birth, and found that these children are at a significantly greater risk for developing an autism spectrum disorder. Or, as &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/forget_vaccines_maybe_we_can_lessen_autism_having_fewer_firstborn_children"&gt;Scientific Blogging&lt;/a&gt; puts it, "Firstborn?   Those are  50% of all kids in America"---so 50% of children in the US would be on the spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women who give birth at 35 or older are 1.7 times more likely to have a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), compared with women between the ages of 20-34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstborn children were nearly 1.8 times more likely to have an autism spectrum disorder; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breech born kids, meaning they were not born head first, were 2 times more likely to have autism,  though the researchers say they didn't identify a causal relationship between breech births and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the birth records of now 8-year-old children who had been identified as being on the autism spectrum in a  2002 epidemiological study by the U.S. &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The children lived in Utah's most populous counties, (Salt Lake, Davis, and Utah); researchers compared birth records for children on the spectrum with "unaffected" children who were born in those three counties in 1994. Of that group, 196 were identified as being on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one reaction when I read about research on the topic of "causes of autism": I review the criteria quickly and consider whether any of it applies to Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In regard to this study: Yes, Charlie is our firstborn (he can't help it; he's an only child). No, he wasn't a breech baby (his quite large head had something to do, we speculate, with him taking quite a long time to be born). I am currently closer to 35 now than I was when he was born (I'm 40, so you know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, different families will have different responses to the &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/5/1293"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. I found myself worrying much more over these sorts of studies, and over the general issue of "what causes autism?" much more when Charlie was 5 and under. After that, I started to become much more aware of how Charlie is similar to Jim and to me---as I wrote back in October as a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/2008/10/thank_you_antivaxxers_and_let.php"&gt;panelist for the Science Blogs Book Club&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's not just because of a shot." My husband, Jim, a historian at Fordham University, often says this about Charlie. As each day passes and we learn more about Charlie, learn about how he communicates (he is minimally verbal) and what his strengths and talents are (not reading, not anything academic---Charlie is far behind his peers in school), we see more of ourselves in Charlie. Hyper at night and happiest when in motion: That's Jim. Able (quite obsessively) to focus on one thing and liking things to be in their places: &lt;i&gt;Ca, c'est moi.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's Charlie because he's the child of Jim and me. He's &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/like-father-like-son/"&gt;very, very like both of us&lt;/a&gt;; many things about him seem a sort of Jim-and-Kristina-&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/checking_the_boxes_biracial_asd_other"&gt;Irish-Chinese&lt;/a&gt;-Catholic-Classicist-Jerseyite-Californian combo (for one thing, Charlie's physical appearance: He's looked like "me as a boy" since he was born, but his height and body type are clearly inherited from Jim's side). However Charlie got to be Charlie----well, I do find it interesting to consider new theories and ideas, but, even more, I like to take the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;long view&lt;/a&gt;. How Charlie became Charlie: That was something that happened once upon a time and now it's now and I'm looking at tomorrow, and thinking about all that lies ahead for Charlie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing i know is that Charlie does best in a highly structured setting in which he has a clear idea of what to do and of what's expected of him, with some "wiggle room" for spontaneity, variation, flexibility. He was sleepy Monday morning after a week off from school for Spring Break but once Jim got Charlie down the stairs, Charlie was all excited running up and down the parking lot, and running onto the bus, and having one fine day. Nerves got to him in the afternoon---my parents are leaving today on a plane and Charlie knows that full well---and he pulled himself through it and we all went to the pool for an early evening swim. (For Charlie and me; my parents don't swim, but after an April day in the high 80s, the water was just the thing to cool our heads and heels.) Afterwards my parents treated us to Chinese takeout (from the "we don't use MSG" restaurant) and we sat on the living room floor with three kinds of noodles with chicken and some extremely spicy tofu and vegetables that Charlie particularly enjoyed, between big sips of water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's my news &lt;i&gt;du jour&lt;/i&gt; about my (yes) firstborn boy, who's on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

The study found that acupuncture was not effective in increasing the pregnancy rate (PR) during in vitro fertilization (IVF). As quoted on MedlinePlus, the lead author, Alice Domar, seems to blame her patients (the presumably poor quality of their embryos) rather than acupuncture for the lack of success, and then she recommends using acupuncture even if it doesn’t work. That was bad enough, but “poor quality embryos” is a hypothesis that was actually tested and rejected in the study itself. Has Domar forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline of the MedlinePlus article says “acupuncture doesn’t boost IVF success for all” – suggesting that it boosts success for some? Then the first sentence says the study suggested that acupuncture doesn’t work, period. But wait…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead researcher says acupuncture may not have worked in her study because, unlike past research, her investigation wasn’t limited to women who had good quality embryos available for transfer. “I’m wondering if my sample was just not a good sample, in that most of the patients in my study were probably not the best-prognosis patients,”&lt;br&gt;
Domar and her team say the most likely explanation for the lack of an acupuncture effect in their study was the fact that they included many women who didn’t have good quality embryos available for transfer. While acupuncture may help a woman become pregnant after the transfer of a healthy embryo, the researcher noted in an interview, it can’t repair an embryo with chromosomal defects or other abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold the boat!! In the Discussion section of the paper itself, Domar et al point out that previous research has included mostly patients with good quality embryos. They ask if perhaps acupuncture only works for good quality embryos? They test that hypothesis by separately analyzing the subjects in this study who had good quality embryos. There was no increase in PR with acupuncture in this sub-group; the results were the same as for the entire sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study not only had an objective endpoint (pregnancy) but it also had several subjective psychological endpoints (optimism, confidence, and anxiety as measured by perceived relaxation). The women who received acupuncture felt more relaxed and enjoyed the IVF procedure more, the researchers found. They were also more optimistic about getting pregnant, but not more confident that they would get pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the results of my own study, I still recommend acupuncture to women going through IVF because there’s no downside,” Domar added, aside from the $150 an acupuncturist would typically charge — a small fraction of the $12,000 to $14,000 couples typically spent on a single round of IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me this translates as: Acupuncture works. It didn’t work in this study, but that can’t be the fault of acupuncture, because acupuncture works. So it must be the fault of the patients for producing poor quality embryos, (our data don’t support that hypothesis, but let’s just ignore that). Acupuncture is harmless and people like it, so let’s use it on every patient whether it works or not. Patients will have to pay $150 extra, but I’m willing to decide for them that the expense is worth it. What?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domar’s study was intended to replicate &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11937123?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;an earlier study by Paulus from 2002&lt;/a&gt;, the first randomized, controlled, prospective study on the impact of acupuncture in 160 IVF patients with good quality embryos. The treatment group got 25 minutes of acupuncture before and after the IVF procedure, and the control group rested for 25 minutes. The pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the acupuncture group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domar also mentions a subsequent study that the Paulus’ group did with the same protocol but using sham acupuncture as a control. There was no significant difference. They proposed an “acupressure” effect of sham acupuncture, assuming that both groups achieved a greater pregnancy rate than they would have with no treatment; but the data don’t support that hypothesis since there was no comparable control group of untreated patients selected for good quality embryos. For some reason, they opted not to publish this second, negative study. It was only presented orally at a conference in Madrid in June 2003. (Paulus WE, Zhang M, Strehler E, Seybold B, Sterzik K. Placebo-controlled trial of acupuncture effects in assisted reproduction therapy. 2003: Oral presentation, ESHRE, Madrid, Spain, June 2003;18(Suppl1): xviii18.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domar’s intent was to repeat Paulus’ study and also investigate the potential of a placebo effect. Double blind acupuncture studies are impossible: the patients know they are getting acupuncture and the acupuncturist knows he’s giving it. But for the first time Domar tried to blind the rest of the IVF treatment team so no one else knew which group a patient was in. She expected the acupuncture patients not only to have a higher pregnancy rate (PR), but also to be more optimistic and confident that their cycle would be successful, thus demonstrating a placebo effect. The acupuncture patients were indeed less anxious and more optimistic, but they were not more confident, and the PR was not higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were asked “how optimistic do you feel” and “how confident do you feel” about the outcome of the current cycle of IVF. I’m not sure where I would draw the line between optimism and confidence; the whole thing is a bit nebulous. And one could argue that false optimism may not be a good thing. If a patient is confident that the IVF will work this time, she will have to deal with greater disappointment when it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can’t understand why they got negative results when previous studies got positive results; but to my mind if acupuncture is no better than placebo, the very fact that the IVF treatment team was blinded would tend to reduce part of the apparent placebo effect. They point out that this is the first study from the United States. In R. Barker Bausell’s book Snake Oil Science, he shows why studies from other countries are more likely to get positive results. (Anecdotally, I recently heard from a friend with contacts in China that a political officer in at least one Chinese research institution reviews all studies before they are submitted for publication and routinely vetoes any studies with negative results.) It is common for a new study in the US to contradict previous studies from elsewhere. And it is common for a well-designed study to contradict results of previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s the part that really blew my mind. In 2005, Alice Domar wrote “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16600220?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Acupuncture and infertility: we need to stick to good science.” &lt;/a&gt;  She pointed out flaws in existing IVF/acupuncture research and mentioned several studies that got negative results (studies that are not mentioned in the review of the literature in the introduction to the current study). She also mentioned one where the acupuncture group had greater pregnancy loss after a second session. She clearly postulated that the apparent effects of acupuncture might be only a placebo effect, and she suggested that there could even be harmful effects. Then she recommended that future studies include a sham treatment. Why, oh why, did she ignore her own advice and do this new study without a sham treatment? She offers no explanation. Even her psychological findings are suspect because she compared a relaxing acupuncture treatment (“how relaxed did you feel during the sessions?”) to an inadequate control: no treatment at all. Would a relaxing massage have produced even better psychological results than acupuncture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing smells of “I want to use acupuncture no matter what.” Indeed, Domar heads the &lt;a href="http://www.domarcenter.com/"&gt;Domar Center for Mind/Body Health&lt;/a&gt;, where acupuncture and other kinds of “mind/body medicine” are offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She does not question the choice of acupuncture points. They were chosen for their sedative effect as well as to increase uterine blood flow. How can she be sure they have these effects? She offers no references to support those claims. If they do have these effects, is there any evidence that sedation and increased uterine blood flow increase fertility? How would that work? Do we have any evidence that anxiety or deficient uterine blood flow impair IVF? (In fact, this study found that the patients in the acupuncture group report reported less anxiety but did not have better outcome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this an example of what I have called Tooth Fairy Science? We can study the amount of money left by the Tooth Fairy in different settings, but since we haven’t determined that there is really a Tooth Fairy, any conclusions we reach will be falsely attributed to an imaginary being rather than to the real cause (parental behavior). In acupuncture studies, the acupuncture points/meridians/qi may be imaginary and we may be studying an elaborate placebo rather than a real physiologic phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study fits a pattern. The original study by Paulus showed an effect of acupuncture on PR but only compared to a no-treatment control group. When he repeated the study with a sham acupuncture control group, there was no difference between the “real” acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups. When Domar improved on the methodology by blinding the treatment team, acupuncture had no effect on PR. As controls are tightened, the effect disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this same pattern appeared in successive studies of a prescription drug, I doubt if Domar would be recommending it for all patients, even if the drug had no reported side effects and the patients felt better when they took it – and even if it “only” cost $150. Of course, if the same pattern appeared in drug studies, the drug would not even be on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domar et al have tried to do good science and have contributed to the evidence against acupuncture. Unfortunately, they seem not to want to accept the implications of their own results; and the poor reporting in the MedlinePlus article only muddied the waters further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The circadian clock coordinates physiological and behavioral processes on a 24-hour rhythm, allowing animals to anticipate changes in their environment and prepare accordingly. Scientists already know that some genes are controlled by the clock and are turned on only one time during each 24-hour cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies found that some genes are switched on once every 12 or 8 hours, indicating that shorter cycles of the circadian rhythm are also biologically encoded. Using a novel time-sampling approach in which the investigators looked at gene activity in the mouse liver every hour for 48 hours, they also found 10-fold more genes controlled by the 24-hour clock than previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_664.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_664.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/fpMDpPyxxCU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240898353461"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7189319526725187192">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a9e3c5704a18e38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">I envy Americans for their politicians for the first time.</title><published>2009-04-28T04:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T04:35:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/L2Vw8Qz-CEM/i-envy-americans-for-their-politicians.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7189319526725187192" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/i-envy-americans-for-their-politicians.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;em&gt;"At such a difficult moment, there are those who say we cannot afford to invest in science.

&lt;p&gt;You may want to check out &lt;a href="http://www.leap.cc/"&gt;www.leap.cc&lt;/a&gt; the website of the organization Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, a group of several thousand current and former law enforcement professionals who are calling for an end to drug prohibition. Not because they condone drug use, certainly, but because drug prohibition is causing far more harm than good. Think of the social harm caused by alcohol prohibition in the 1920s, and multiply that disaster by exponential quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve expresses my feelings on the matter quite well. I believe that if the sale and use of drugs were to be suddenly legalized, first, the entire criminal community would be almost instantly crippled due to lack of income, on an international scale.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240896442052"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3105">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a5b006d22b6a333</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="atheists"/><category term="New York Times"/><title type="html">NY Times reports the rise in atheists</title><published>2009-04-28T04:49:48Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T04:49:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/ny-times-reports-the-rise-in-atheists/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this error of evangelicals publishing articles warning their flocks that they’re losing the culture war as evil atheists grow in number, it’s refreshing to see the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/us/27atheist.html?_r=2&amp;amp;src=twt&amp;amp;twt=nytimes"&gt;New York Times write a positive piece about the rising number of atheists who are coming out of the closet all across the country&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts/man-died-an-hour-after-being-treated-for-peanut-allergy-1719832.html"&gt;A man suffering from a peanut allergy died&lt;/a&gt; less than an hour after being treated by an alternative medicine practitioner. Shocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had earlier been treated for the peanut allergy by kinesiologist Dr Brett Stevens, who told the inquest that Mr Schatten ate a small bit of peanut during his appointment, to which he had no reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allergy elimination technique used by Dr Stevens, who is also a chiropractor, is called NAET and involves “muscle testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “doctor” was a chiropractor. Shocker. Sadly, this was an entirely predictable outcome given that alternative medicine is a total scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grayhek discovered a pattern in the rocks in his backyard. . .a miraculous pattern. Now instead of recognizing that this is just pareidolia of the mind, he’s claiming a 9-foot tall imprint in the rocks is none other than the hand print of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can tell this has really touched his soul in a very profound way by how he’s decided to put “the rights” to it up for auction on eBay, which everyone knows is the place to auction off truly amazing artifacts. With 3 days left in the auction, the current highest bid is a whopping $250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many ridiculous things in this story. The first ridiculous thing is the fact that someone actually thinks that this pattern in the rocks is a miracle from God. The second is the fact that this guy isn’t actually auctioning off the rock itself, but merely the “rights” to the rock (whatever that means). And the third is that people out there are stupid enough to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so much I could say about the blackhole of stupid here but I prefer to get to the question I know is on everyone’s mind. Yes, God’s apparently got smaller hands than Dr. Manhattan, and you know what they say about gods with small hands, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also estimate that God’s foot probably isn’t as big as that of the statue on Lost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two articles on @BoraZ in today's Durham Herald-Sun. Will post links later. Herald-Sun has pain in the ass registration to access site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went out and got a hardcopy of the paper, and also looked at it online (feel free to use login: coturnixfan and password: boraborabora to see the articles, thanks Bill). The first article starts on the front page of Chapel Hill Herald (I think that if you buy the paper in Durham, Chapel Hill Herald is inside, but if you buy it in Chapel Hill, it becomes the front section) with &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=34578271&amp;amp;id=11805043" title=""&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both articles were written by Caroline McMillan, who you may remember as the author of &lt;a href="http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/2008/10/09/creative-coworking-offers-a-new-dynamic/" title=""&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href="http://carrborocommons.org/2008/10/02/creative-coworking-offers-a-new-dynamic/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about telecommuting and coworking. She had so much left-over material from the interview with me (as well as coming to ScienceOnline'09) that she pitched - obviously successfully - an additional pair of articles to Durham Herald-Sun: and here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://heraldsun.southernheadlines.com/orange/10-1146564.cfm?" title=""&gt;Life as a blogger around the clock&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's something different about Bora Zivkovic,...........

&lt;p&gt;..................Or it could be the way he tucks his chin to his chest, showing a head of dark hair peppered with gray, and looks over his round-lens glasses to give you eye contact, smiling with the edges of his mouth turned up -- almost like he's holding a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you haven't met Bora Zivkovic at all. If you're one of the 100,000 to 200,000 people per month who view his blog, "A Blog Around the Clock," you probably know him by his online name, Coturnix...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://heraldsun.southernheadlines.com/orange/10-1146548.cfm" title=""&gt;Blogs can come in all shapes, sizes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With those kind of numbers, there's obviously some healthy competition in the online community. Zivkovic's decision to name his site "A Blog Around the Clock" was strategic. It's no accident that the name starts with the letters "a" and "b.".........

&lt;p&gt;............."It's no accident," he said, smiling. "I am very, very devious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/in_todays_papers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/9uzxEgFTiQ8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240891499126"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/35eb61b2b1863900</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Sticker Shock</title><published>2009-04-28T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/fraud/autos/sticker.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Warning about thieves' stealing registration validation stickers from automobile license plates.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240890085569"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/swine_flu_outbreaks_and_the_et.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de5a013274be3b24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current events"/><title type="html">Swine flu outbreaks and the ethics of being sick.</title><published>2009-04-28T04:40:18Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T04:40:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/PVF_Xy1Ou94/swine_flu_outbreaks_and_the_et.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/swine_flu_outbreaks_and_the_et.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other people, I'm watching the swine flu outbreaks unfold with some interest.

&lt;p&gt;There are some fairly easy ethical calls here -- for example, if you're sick and can avoid spreading your germs, you should avoid spreading them.  But there are some other questions whose answers are not as clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/swine_flu_outbreaks_and_the_et.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/swine_flu_outbreaks_and_the_et.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/PVF_Xy1Ou94" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240888717854"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4245">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cb4c3f2cbb9aa13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="ncse" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="NCSE"/><category term="religion" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="religion"/><title type="html">Let me try again ...</title><published>2009-04-28T03:24:08Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T03:43:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/let-me-try-agai.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;… with (a little) less snark, fewer red herrings, and the admission of a change of mind in one respect, thanks in part to reading contrary posts here and elsewhere and comments on my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/generals-who-do.html" rel=""&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/" rel="external "&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt;, seconded by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/jerry_coyne_lobs_another_bomb.php" rel="external "&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/04/jerry-coyne-on-science-organisations.html" rel="external "&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/trouble-with-ncse.html" rel="external "&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt; among others, has written a critique of the “accommodationist” position taken by the National Center for Science Education, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Coyne characterizes those organizations’ positions as meaning that NCSE “cuddles up to [religion], kisses it, and tells it that everything will be all right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Coyne argued, those organizations &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; a particular religious view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to separate NCSE from NAS and AAAS in this post and focus just on the former.  The latter two are organizations of professional scientists, and it’s reasonable to expect them to focus solely on science advocacy in their public efforts.  I will not defend nor attempt to justify their remarks on religion here, though I now think they’re potentially problematic – comments do have an effect!  But I took most umbrage at Coyne’s remarks about NCSE, and that umbrage stimulated my earlier post and is the focus of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Science Education is a different kind of animal from AAAS and NAS.  Its &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/" rel="external "&gt;web site masthead&lt;/a&gt; plainly states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCSE provides information and advice as the premier institution dedicated to keeping evolution in the science classroom and creationism out. LEARN MORE &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/about" rel="external "&gt;LEARN MORE&lt;/a&gt; link leads to this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) is a not-for-profit, membership organization providing information and resources for schools, parents and concerned citizens working to keep evolution in public school science education. We educate the press and public about the scientific, educational, and legal aspects of the creation and evolution controversy, and supply needed information and advice to defend good science education at local, state, and national levels. Our 4000 members are scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, NCSE is not an association of scientists, but of an array of people with different professions and beliefs.  Moreover, it is not a science advocacy group as such, but rather is a group that has as its goal the defense of the teaching of evolution in the public schools.  And that defense is necessarily heavily political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that its tactics are in part determined by those of the opposition, the creationists who would turn public school science classes into an opportunity to teach religiously-based creation stories.  As a consequence, it has to take into account that opposition and its main arguments, so as to &lt;em&gt;appropriately&lt;/em&gt; arm those “parents and concerned citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creationist assault on public education has two main prongs.  One is to attack, misrepresent, and distort the science, and NCSE has a wealth of resources for blunting that attack.  To give but one example, it has &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/10-answers-to-jonathan-wellss-10-questions" rel="external "&gt;an excellent counter&lt;/a&gt; to Jonathan Wells’ “Ten questions to ask your biology teacher about evolution.”  The responses are brief, to the point, and effective: I’ve used them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main prong of the creationist assault is to equate evolution with atheism.  That is a ubiquitous theme from the whole range of creationists, from Kent Hovind’s ravings to the Disco ‘Tute’s anti-naturalism Wedge document.  I hear it, every one of us working with local and state boards of education hears it.  It’s in the creationist mailers, it’s in their pamphlets, and it’s in their public statements to school boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And NCSE &lt;em&gt;completely appropriately&lt;/em&gt; provides information to “parents and concerned citizens” about that issue.  It &lt;em&gt;completely appropriately&lt;/em&gt; points out that there are believers – self identified Christians – who accept that evolution has occurred (it’s a fact) and that the modern theory of evolution is the best available naturalistic explanation of that fact.  Moreover, NCSE &lt;em&gt;completely appropriately&lt;/em&gt; points to religious organizations that have stated that they accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot argue that pointing to the existence of people and organizations that contradict a main prong of the creationist attack on public school education constitutes an “endorsement.”  It’s merely pointing to a fact.  This is what NCSE says about it in &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/religion" rel="external "&gt;the introduction&lt;/a&gt; to its Science and Religion section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I both accept what science teaches and engage in religious belief and practice? This is a complex issue, but theologians, clergy, and members of many religious traditions have concluded that the answer is, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s true, a plain fact, and useful for folks in the field to be able to support via the religious organizations and individuals identified by NCSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to this point I think NCSE is doing its job, and doing it well.  However, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOMA is a mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne is right in one respect, and I withdraw my wholesale rejection of his argument.  I think (writing now as a Life Member) that NCSE has recently made a mistake in going beyond simply pointing to individuals and organizations who have somehow reconciled their science and religious beliefs to counter the creationist equation of evolution with atheism.  In the essays by Peter M. J. Hess that apparently are the basis of the NCSE Faith Project, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an endorsement of a particular view of the relationship, an adaptation of Gould’s &lt;a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html" rel="external "&gt;Nonoverlapping magisteria&lt;/a&gt; with a dose of complementarian thinking.  &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/religion" rel="external "&gt;Hess writes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theologians from many traditions hold that science and religion occupy different spheres of knowledge. Science asks questions such as “What is it?” “How does it happen?” “By what processes?” In contrast, religion asks questions such as “What is life’s meaning?” “What is my purpose?” “Is the world of value?” These are complementary rather than conflicting perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later, in a linked section titled “God and Religion,” &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/religion/god-evolution" rel="external "&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question “Do you believe in creation or evolution?” has the same problem. Like color and shape, “creation” and “evolution” do not occupy competing categories, but are complementary ways of looking at the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later in that same section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I accept evolution as the most compelling explanation for biological diversity, and yet also accept the idea that God works through evolution? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hess has here argued for a complementarian view of the relation between religious belief and evolution that is very similar to Gould’s NOMA, which is also a view that is clearly visible in the writings of people like &lt;a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/3EvoCr.htm" rel="external "&gt;Denis Lamoureax&lt;/a&gt;, a self-identified evangelical Christian and “evolutionary creationist.”  Lamoureax writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In understanding origins, evolutionary creation proposes a mutually exclusive yet complementary relationship between science and Scripture. This position asserts that God reveals through both nature and the Bible, and it respects the limits and differences of each revelation. Science discovers how the Creator made the world, while Scripture offers the ultimate meaning of the creation. Together these revelations from God’s Works and Words complement each other in providing a complete view of origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOMA redux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its Faith Project, then, I think that NCSE has gone beyond its remit and past where it can be effective.  I now think – in agreement with Coyne, PZ, and others – that it should back off from describing particular ways of reconciling science and religion.  Pointing to religious people and organizations who have made their peace with science and evolution is appropriate, but going past that to describing particular ways of making that peace is a mistake.  NCSE ought not wade into theological swamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I was wrong to overstate my case.  Sorry, folks.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000003" title=""&gt;A Role for the PERIOD:PERIOD Homodimer in the Drosophila Circadian Clock&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The current models of circadian clocks in flies and mammals involve the formation of complexes between clock proteins in the cytoplasm. These complexes are usually heterodimers (that is, made up of two different clock proteins) and appear to enter the nucleus at certain times of the circadian day in order to shut down their own gene expression by deactivating specific transcription factors. After progressive phosphorylation the repressor proteins eventually are degraded so that a new cycle of transcription can begin. Here we present evidence that in addition to heterodimeric complexes, the clock protein PERIOD (PER) also forms homodimers (pairs of identical proteins). Based on a structural model a PER mutant was designed, which is not able to form homodimers but can still bind to its partner TIMELESS (TIM). Flies expressing this mutant PER protein show abnormal clock function in regard to PER nuclear translocation, repressor activity, and behavioral rhythms. The circadian clock model in flies therefore needs to be extended by adding the PER:PER homodimer as a functional unit. Recent structural studies with mammalian PER proteins suggest that homodimers between clock proteins are an important general feature of eukaryotic clocks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000094" title=""&gt;Structural and Functional Analyses of PAS Domain Interactions of the Clock Proteins Drosophila PERIOD and Mouse PERIOD2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most organisms have daily activity cycles (circadian rhythms), which are generated by circadian clocks. Circadian periodicity is produced by specific clock protein interactions and posttranslational modifications as well as changes in their cellular localization, expression, and stability. To learn more about the molecular processes underlying circadian clock operation in fruit flies and mouse, we analysed the homo- and heterodimeric interactions of the clock proteins Drosophila PERIOD (dPER) and mouse PERIOD2 (mPER2). We show that dPER and mPER2 use different interaction surfaces for homodimer formation, which are associated with different dimerization affinities. In addition, we present a structure-based biochemical analysis of the heterodimeric interaction of dPER with its partner Drosophila TIMELESS (dTIM). We identify a versatile molecular surface of the PERIOD proteins, which mediates homodimer formation of mPER2 but is used for dPER-dTIM heterodimer formation in Drosophila. Our results reveal quantitative and qualitative differences in the molecular interactions of PERIOD clock proteins in flies and mammals, allowing them to adjust to their different binding partners and regulatory functions in these different organisms.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/clock_news_7.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/5_5c2k4UG-c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240880925685"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/27/boltzmann-in-the-funny-pages/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2741634d5b37d06d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">Boltzmann in the Funny Pages</title><published>2009-04-28T01:07:45Z</published><updated>2009-04-28T01:07:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/27/boltzmann-in-the-funny-pages/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/08/01/boltzmanns-anthropic-brain/"&gt;Brains&lt;/a&gt;, anyway.

The project specializes in 5 specific disabilities, of which autism is one.  Whether the mentors are themselves disabled is unclear from the article (though my unfortunate guess is that the answer is an assumed "no").  What about hooking a 6th grader on the spectrum up with a 12th grader who is also on the spectrum? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new program and study where it is clear however, is the &lt;a href="http://www.rri.pdx.edu/stem_mentor.php"&gt;STEM Mentor Project&lt;/a&gt; which matches a disabled college student in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) major with a high school student who has a similar disability and area of interest.  The stated purpose of that study,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the STEM Mentor project is to find out whether mentors who are in STEM postsecondary programs or careers will increase youth interest in and plans to go to college and work in a STEM field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one does not, to my knowledge, exist currently, the idea of an all-autistic "big brothers / big sisters" type program has come up a lot both within the autistic young adult and adult community, and from other sources--for example support staff I spoke with last week who have interest in connecting autistic clients up with mentors who are also on the spectrum.  &lt;/p&gt;

I’m concerned as well (especially knowing that antivaxxers are probably licking their chops over this), but I’m also lazy and busy, so instead of new material I’ll repost &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/07/17/i-wash-my-hands-of-you/"&gt;this blog entry&lt;/a&gt; from 2005 about hygiene and hand washing. It’s still true and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="60%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you wash your hands after using the bathroom? No? &lt;i&gt;Why the hell not?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1840s (the &lt;i&gt;1840s&lt;/i&gt;, folks, &lt;i&gt;160 years ago&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi622.htm"&gt;Ignaz Phillip Semmelweis&lt;/a&gt; figured that washing hands before surgery would cut the infection rate of patients… and this was decades before germs were tagged as the cause of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies harbor vast numbers of germs, and a lot of them just love to hang out in our nether regions. Here’s a fun thing to know: human feces are 75% water, but of the remaining 25%, &lt;a href="http://www.medfriendly.com/feces.html#whatare"&gt;the majority is composed of live and dead bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. Yum! The simple act of washing your hands after getting rid of your latest quota of feces will get rid of the majority of those germs that might have made it, somehow, onto your hands. And from there to the flush handle, and to the doorknob, and to whatever else you touch for the next three hours until you wash your hands. Do you use a pencil or pen at work? Do you chew on the end sometimes, putting the pencil in your mouth, the pencil you held in your hands, after touching the doorknob, the flush handle, your fecal bacteria?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I have made my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you decide to wash your hands. What about that guy you saw leaving the public bathroom as you went in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question. To answer it, &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-09/asfm-aua091103.php"&gt;Wirthlin Worldwide conducted a survey in 2003&lt;/a&gt; to see what people did in airport bathrooms. The result? About 1/4 of the men and 1/6 of the women leave a bathroom without washing their hands. I have no idea if they accounted for people going in to check their makeup, to brush their teeth, etc. Still, this is an appalling statistic. We’ve known about the efficacy of washing our hands for &lt;i&gt;16 decades&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheesh. Wash your hands, folks. And use soap. Just rinsing doesn’t help, and in fact it hurts– wet hands are a great place for breeding more microscopic critters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with this bit from the article linked above. I was curious about how the study was done. The article says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey … observed 7,541 people in public washrooms in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, and Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No details on how this “observation” was done in the article. Yikes. The next time you see someone loitering in the bathroom at an airport with a clipboard and a hawk-like gaze, peering at people oddly and furtively as they enter and leave the bathroom… thank him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240867602155"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/where_to_go_for_swine_flu_info.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c56872e0f30f06c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News"/><title type="html">Where to go for swine flu information</title><published>2009-04-27T21:15:38Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T21:15:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XdTS1pDM_B0/where_to_go_for_swine_flu_info.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/where_to_go_for_swine_flu_info.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is some cause for worry in the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_04/017911.php"&gt;current reports on the swine flu outbreak&lt;/a&gt; — while the possibility of a global pandemic is being raised, at this point it really is only a possibility. The accounts from Mexico are not reassuring, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials reported that at least eight students at a private high school in New York City had "probable" swine flu. They also confirmed three new cases -- two in Kansas and one in California -- bringing the total number of confirmed U.S. cases to 11. The president of Mexico, where the outbreak has killed as many as 81 people, issued an order granting his government broad powers to isolate patients and question travelers. (...)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The virus, for which there is no vaccine for humans, has nearly brought Mexico City to a halt. Normally congested downtown streets in this city of 20 million were almost empty Saturday, and of the few people who ventured outside, many said they did so only out of necessity. Soldiers posted at subway stations handed out face masks to passersby from the back of armored vehicles. Some pedestrians covered their mouths and noses with scarves and rags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2009/04/swine_flu_a_quick_overview--an.php"&gt;Aetiology has an excellent summary&lt;/a&gt; that represents where we should be in our thinking right now — no need for panic, but it emphasizes the importance of research and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, this is a fast-developing story, and it will take much more investigation and field work to determine the true extent of the virus's spread in the population; to figure out where it originated (one blog suggests a Mexican hog confinement according to some local Mexican papers, but that is conjecture at this point); how it jumped to humans; and how efficiently it's transmitted. Whether this burns out or spreads worldwide, it certainly shows once again the importance of surveillance and monitoring of influenza strains, and demonstrates that improving our infrastructure due to concerns about H5N1 will benefit us whether that serotype, or another emergent strain, ends up being the next global influenza threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We almost have a date and time for Charlie's IEP (later this week......)----one more resource is the &lt;a href="http://www.bridges4kids.org/IEP/iep.goal.bank.pdf"&gt;IEP Goal Bank&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.bridges4kids.org/"&gt;Bridges4Kids&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.bridges4kids.org/IEP/iep.goal.bank.pdf"&gt;IEP Goal Bank&lt;/a&gt; lists specific goals in a number of categories, including Mathematics, Functional Academics, Independent Living, Speech and Language, Vocational/Career Education. Even if you don't use any of the actual goals, seeing how they are worded and how to articulate mastery criteria, etc., is very helpful as you put together goals for your own child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly we review each and every one of the goals set down in Charlie's draft IEP carefully----remember, you don't have to sign the IEP immediately. Take it home and read it; set it aside, sleep on it, talk about it with those who've been there or are themselves going through the IEP process---'tis the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/because_iep_season_is_upon_us"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240862978453"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/british_humanists_schedule_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d141c9db214bfa8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">British Humanists schedule their meeting to avoid me, too</title><published>2009-04-27T20:50:01Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T20:50:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/HV-YJJD14kA/british_humanists_schedule_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/british_humanists_schedule_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, well.

Most readers here have probably never heard of the Michigan Central Station train depot. Suffice it to say that it is a huge train station that was, in its heyday at least, &lt;a href="http://www.forgottendetroit.com/mcs/history.html"&gt;every bit as impressive&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="http://grandcentralterminal.com/"&gt;Grand Central Station&lt;/a&gt; in New York or &lt;a href="http://www.chicagounionstation.com/"&gt;Union Station&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago. Indeed, it's not for nothing that the Michigan Central Station was likened to "Michigan's Ellis Island," as it was frequently the first thing in Detroit that new arrivals saw, as this &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20090426/OPINION01/904260611"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the same issue of the Free Press as the faith healing and detox stories describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Generations of Detroiters arrived at the Michigan Central Station in southwest Detroit: African Americans from the Deep South; Poles, Romanians and Hungarians from Eastern Europe; Lebanese and Syrians from the Middle East.

&lt;p&gt;The depot's once-grand lobby, built in 1913, was their first glimpse of Detroit, a sure sign that their lives had changed forever. The empty, elegant ruin once hummed with people who walked on marble floors under gold-plated chandeliers. This is sullied but sacred ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's our Ellis Island," said Shaun Nethercott, who lives a mile from the depot and is the founder and executive director of Matrix Theatre Co. on Bagley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in its desolation, the depot has become a tourist magnet, attracting thousands of photographers. Is it poverty porn that draws them, or a real thirst to understand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say it's probably both. In the more than twenty years since the Michigan Central Station closed, the building has deteriorated to, in essence, urban ruins. Thanks to politics and neglect, the once beautiful building is now a disintegrating shell stripped to the bone by looters and vandals, its wall defaced by decades of graffiti. Both options, renovation and restoration or demolition, have thus far been too expensive and/or too politically difficult, and now it's a blight that threatens the renaissance of the surrounding neighborhood, as this &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20090426/OPINION01/904260608"&gt;companion story&lt;/a&gt; shows, along with this brief video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage used to be an institution that was sacred. It was resereved for one man and one woman at a time. It was so glorious that many of America’s elite, like Larry King and J-Lo, chose to celebrate it many times over. But now, America’s most sacred institution is being defiled. And your marriage (whether or not you’re married) is at risk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, tell me how gay marriage is threatening your matrimonial bonds. &lt;strong&gt;Does the thought of having to accept people different than you make you so angry you forced to beat your wife for not having a hot dinner on the table? Are you unable to afford an interior designer to help you compete with the boys next door? Are lesbians creating long waits at your barber so they can get their “bridal buzz cuts” in time for the wedding? How is gay marriage hurting you, personally, right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I find the bit, "Lizzy's diagnosis took 18 months. If she had thrown a chair across the classroom, she would have got the help she needed from the start," easy to relate to--the Lizzy of the article isn't the only person on the spectrum who didn't get identified as being in trouble due to lack of aggressive behavior.  While I can be pushed toward aggressive meltdowns, much more often I become catatonic, which was, ironically, was interpreted as "good behavior" by teachers in school (I was sitting still and shutting up after all). While I disagree very strongly with this idea that the main emotion people on the spectrum experience is fear (yikes! please, please don't take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; as fact!), I do find the notion that "being in trouble" doesn't look exactly the same in all autistic people a critically important one for both diagnosticians and every one else to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

But I’ll warn you, I get a little ticked at the end here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, this really is fantastic and highly encouraging news: speaking at the National Academy of Sciences today, President Obama confirmed what most of us in the reality-based community have been hoping for: a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; reinvestment in science. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=65"&gt;In his speech today&lt;/a&gt;, he outlines a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; increase in science investing by the government. It includes a doubling of the budget for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, both of which are fundamental supporters of basic research in the U.S. It includes making permanent a tax credit to companies that do basic research and experimentation. It includes $150 billion over ten years to invest in sources of renewable energy and energy efficiency. And (perhaps most excitingly) it includes the creation of a new initiative: the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, or ARPA-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original ARPA (as part of the Department of Defense) &lt;em&gt;helped create the Internet&lt;/em&gt;. So we’re talking big-time stuff here, and aimed squarely at scientific research, developing new methods of creating energy, and new ways of using it. I am completely and 100% behind an effort like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I feel an immense sense of relief. In his inauguration speech, Obama said he would restore science to its rightful place, something we desperately needed after eight years of the jack-booted heel that had been at science’s neck. Not only has that heel being removed, a hand is being offered to help us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is still a sense of unease I have, and it became more clear as I read the President’s speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/nasa_question.jpg" alt="NASA question"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentions NASA several times, including how the Apollo program was our response to a huge challenge (the Soviet launch of Sputnik and the threat of an enemy’s superiority in space), how it gave us new opportunities in science and research, and how it gave our country a renewed sense of exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in that speech President Obama uses NASA many times as an analogy. But what about where the rubber hits the road; how does NASA fare in this huge increase in science investment? In that speech, NASA is mentioned only &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to benefits of this new resurgence in science, and only then in NASA’s ability to help investigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is an important part of NASA’s mission, it’s only one part. I would say that NASA’s main goal is to &lt;em&gt;explore&lt;/em&gt;. To push back boundaries, to see how far we can go, to see just what we can do in space. I would bet solid money that most people in this country would agree with that; the most famous and publicly-known missions are Hubble, Cassini, Apollo and the like. That’s what we see from NASA, and that’s what the public &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s no mention of this in Obama’s speech. No talk of solid reinvestment in NASA’s space science, or of how it will help create the next generation of scientific exploration in astronomy, space, and  aeronautics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, NASA’s budget did pretty well in both the economic stimulus package and in the federal budget. But it bugs me that Obama didn’t see fit to talk about this in his otherwise very lengthy speech. And if that seems petty of me, remember that right now &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/milesobrien/2009/04/27/first-dog-trumps-final-fronter/"&gt;NASA doesn’t have a chief Administrator&lt;/a&gt;! Mike Griffin left the post months ago, and Obama has not appointed a new one. Why not? If NASA is a priority in Obama’s mind, then why leave it headless for over three months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why pick the new White House puppy before the top dog at NASA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what concerns me, very much. Obama talks a good game, and in almost all cases he has walked the walk as well. After eight years of lies, deception, and ideologically-driven politics trumping reality pretty much every time, a President who respects and understands the importance of science is like breathing fresh air after almost a decade of living in a windowless slaughterhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still. NASA has but a handful of Shuttle launches left before the fleet is retired next year. The Ares rockets are nowhere near ready to pick up the slack, and I’m guessing (and I sincerely hope I’m wrong) that we’ll have more than a five year gap before NASA can launch humans into space again after the Shuttles shut down. Many NASA science programs are running late and over budget. Decisions need to be made, and soon, about what NASA will be doing in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaping money on the space agency won’t close the rocket gap, nor will it accelerate or fix the other problems. But a NASA without a permanent chief is one that cannot make the big decisions, or at least cannot make them and expect them to stick. And while NASA is a small part of the national budget (much less than 1%), it still looms large in the future of this country; when we have to start paying the Russians to launch our payloads into space you can just bet there will be some noise made about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, President Obama: I praise you on your phenomenal support of science, and your understanding that we cannot simply restore it to where it was before Bush’s Pyrrhic onslaught, but must &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; its standing in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whence NASA? When will you find the time to make sure our most famous and one of the most important agencies gets your attention, the attention it deserves and so desperately needs?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240852152293"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/republican_party_platforms_are.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce98491e54b280f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Republican party platforms are always amusingly insane</title><published>2009-04-27T17:08:36Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T17:08:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/hcd1-rQ8evU/republican_party_platforms_are.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/republican_party_platforms_are.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;ERV has just posted the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/04/oklahoma_gop_platform_absolute.php"&gt;Oklahoma GOP platform&lt;/a&gt;, and she&amp;#39;s right — any random amble through any piece of it will have you laughing at the audacity of wingnuttia. ERV singled out a piece endorsing the teaching of creationism in the classroom, but this is my favorite, just because they are two goals sitting right next to each other, and the Rethuglicans didn&amp;#39;t even notice the contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. While the objective study of 
philosophy and religion can be 
beneficial, public schools should not 
be endorsing any specific religion or 
philosophy.  We believe that students 
and teachers should enjoy the right of 
free exercise of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. We support posting the Ten 
Commandments and our Nation's 
motto, "In God We Trust," in all 
public schools in recognition of our 
religious heritage. U.S. citizens. We support teaching the 
intent of our founding fathers, the 
original founding documents, and the 
difference between a democracy and a 
republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the public schools shouldn't endorse any specific religion or philosophy, but they should be be posting the ten commandments? What, do they imagine that everyone, even atheists, recognizes the authority of Moses' wacky religious proscriptions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/republican_party_platforms_are.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/hcd1-rQ8evU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240851947473"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9319">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3842de2df3d8448c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="craig damrauer"/><category term="math"/><title type="html">Introducing "New Math"</title><published>2009-04-27T16:56:29Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T16:56:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/T_USR3WrjBc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/introducing-new-math/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Not long ago, we linked to a site called New Math, whose proprietor is named Craig Damrauer.

Click &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;here for more info on TAM&lt;/a&gt;. I should mention too that some of the extra events are filling up. As of right now, everything is still open, including the workshops, show tickets, and private Randi events, but as in years past, there's a good chance they'll sell out. Best not to wait there either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have to mention the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/454-tam-7-scholarship-info.html"&gt;TAM Scholarship program&lt;/a&gt;. This year, due to the economy and other factors we've been overwhelmed with applications, and the generous donations we've received thusfar haven't been enough to meet demand. To try to help get people to TAM who couldn't otherwise afford it, Kitty Mervine is organizing a unique auction to help raise some money. Check it out on our forum at &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/forumdisplay.php?f=67"&gt;this address&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the items available include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;A very special signed photograph of James Randi in the Galapagos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;A cornucopia of George Hrab goodies, pants optional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;A set of professional juggling balls signed by Michael Goodeau of Lance Burton and &lt;em&gt;Bullshit!&lt;/em&gt; fame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

In 2009, Howard was nominated for the rank of Rear Admiral upper half.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From blog &lt;a href="http://thetension.blogspot.com/2009/04/rear-adm-michelle-howard-assumes.html"&gt;The Tension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;USS BOXER, At Sea, April 5, 2009 -- Rear Adm. Michelle Howard assumed command of Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) 2 during a ceremony held on board USS Boxer (LHD 4) today and relieved Rear Adm. Terence McKnight, ESG 2’s commander since November 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to relieving McKnight as the ESG 2 commander, Howard assumes command of several U.S. 5th Fleet task forces, including Combined Task Force (CTF) 51 and 59, as well as CTF 151, an international maritime coalition created to disrupt, deter and thwart piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://www.usna.com/SSLPage.aspx?RSS=alumni&amp;amp;referrer=&amp;amp;pid=7748"&gt;US Naval Academy Alumni Association&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This weekend Rear Admiral Michelle Howard had a baptism of fire when US commandos were called in to rescue the captured captain of the American cargo ship Maersk Alabama after a five-day standoff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The commandos killed three Somali pirates holding Captain Richard Phillips and a fourth pirate was taken into custody by US authorities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
'Piracy is a problem that affects all maritime nations and requires an international solution. I'm looking forward to working with naval professionals from around the world on this vital mission,' she said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rear Admiral Howard was the first African American woman to command a ship in the US Navy in 1999 and her new role as the commander of CTF 151 brings with it unique challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The pirates have moved away from the Gulf of Aden into the wider Indian Ocean which is one of the world's most crucial shipping lanes, with Gulf-registered oil vessels and other merchant ships carrying billions of dollars worth of cargo. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pirates were killed by SEAL snipers aboard the USS Bainbridge, Commander Frank X. Castellano's ship, leading to the successful rescue of Capt. Rick Phillips.  The Bainbridge is part of Rear Admiral Howard's command.

The UK has a lot of battle-dead inhumations. There's even Neolithic battlefield archaeology of sorts at hillforts that have been besieged by archers and thus are full of flint arrowheads to this day. I heard a paper on this topic by Roger Mercer at an EAA conference back in ~1996, so I knew a little bit about it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the issue is about the differentiation of Roman "villa" sites into functional categories such as shrines, tax-collecting depots and rural manors. In Scandyland we have nothing as visible as villa sites from the 1st Millennium, mainly because even the top-level elite up here used exclusively perishable building materials at the time. Our shrines and manors show up only if you metal detect them, which unfortunately isn't being done much because of our laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opinion piece by the pseudonymous writer Amicus Curiae, "Friend of the Court", has some interesting things to say about UK's heritage curators (minions of the County Archaeologists?). Apparently they correspond in their duties to our &lt;i&gt;biträdande länsantikvarier&lt;/i&gt;, but their level of proficiency isn't uniformly great if we're to believe Amicus Curiae.&lt;blockquote&gt;... curators without field experience have become, as Don Alhambra put it, 'plentiful as tabby cats in point of fact, too many.' Often they are recent graduates. The results are predictable. They perceieve archaeological potential where there isn't any, and miss it where there is. [...] If I may refer you to the [Institute for Archaeologists]'s latest survey, &lt;i&gt;Profiling the Profession&lt;/i&gt;: 'The university system does not prepare students for any type of professional archaeological work.' Courses do not embrace excavation experience any more than literacy or numeracy, as employers have testified.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This calls to mind the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/swedish_archaeology_programs_e.php"&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; of the National Agency for Higher Education regarding Swedish archaeology training. May the UK situation be due to a need among universities to prioritise putting asses in lecture-hall seats over teaching dull &amp;amp; gritty professional skills? Or is it because academe is cultivating its own ivory tower version of theoretical archaeology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mag also has a great big catalogue of digs in the UK that will welcome volunteer workers this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 28 April:&lt;/b&gt; Dear Reader Jonathan comments,&lt;blockquote&gt;The quote that &lt;i&gt;Amicus&lt;/i&gt; disingenuously gives from the report (which can be &lt;a href="http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/lmi%200708/Archaeology_LMI_report_colour.pdf"&gt;downloaded as a PDF here&lt;/a&gt;) isn't from any part of its conclusions, but from a sample response included as an appendix (p. 218). Thus, it's not a finding of the report or its authors ... I can't immediately see anything in the report proper that supports the point &lt;i&gt;Amicus&lt;/i&gt; apparently wants to make.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amicus&lt;/i&gt; here seems to have taken on the anti-intellectual rôle of demeaning professionals and academics as ivory-tower dilettantes, perhaps as an editorial appeal to CA&amp;#39;s amateur and lay readership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/current_archaeologys_may_issue.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/6m9eBdoxs1E" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240838849863"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_ny_times_saying_positive_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae4f3e9988021f00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">The NY Times saying positive things about atheists?</title><published>2009-04-27T14:03:51Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T14:03:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/marajiuQvvI/the_ny_times_saying_positive_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_ny_times_saying_positive_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;See, this is the problem with the godless liberal media: they can sometimes treat the rise of atheism as something newsworthy, and in a good way, instead of simply slapping us down.

Skepticism, as an intellectual endeavor, is the study of these mental pitfalls, for a thorough understanding of them is the best way to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science itself is a set of methods for avoiding or minimizing errors in observation, memory, and analysis. Our instincts cannot be trusted, so we need to keep them in check with objective outcome measures, systematic observation, and rigid control of variables. In fact bias has a way of creeping into any observation and exerting powerful if subtle effects, leading to the need to completely blind scientific experiments. Good scientists have learned not to trust even themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common and insidious bits of cognitive self-deception is the process of anomaly hunting. A true anomaly is something that cannot be explained by our current model of nature - it doesn’t fit into existing theories. Anomalies are therefore very useful to scientific inquiry because they point to new knowledge, the potential to deepen or extend existing theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the orbit of Mercury could not be explained by Newtownian mechanics - it was a true anomaly. It and other anomalies hinted at the fact that Newton’s laws of motion were incomplete in a fundamental way. This recognition eventually lead to Einstein’s revolution of relativity theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscientists - those pretending to do science (maybe even sincerely believing they are doing science) but who get the process profoundly wrong, use anomalies in a different way. They often engage it what we call anomaly hunting - looking for apparent anomalies. They are not, however, looking for clues to a deeper understanding of reality. They are often hunting for anomalies in service to the overarching pseudoscientific process of reverse engineering scientific conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that pseudoscience almost always works backwards - that is its primary malfunction, starting with a desired conclusion and then looking for evidence and twisting logic to support that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to anomalies the logic often works like this: “If my pet theory is true then when I look at the data I will find anomalies.” The unstated major premise of this logic is that if their pet theory were not true then they would not find anomalies. This is naive, however. Another component of this line of argument is the broad definition of anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real science an anomaly is only declared so after exhaustive efforts to explain it within existing theories fail. Astronomers checked and quadruple checked their calculations of Mercury’s orbit. They hypothesized that there were other bodies in the solar system exerting gravitational effects on Mercury. They did everything they could to explain Mercury’s orbit within Newtonian physics.  This process didn’t really end until Einstein explained the orbit of Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What pseudoscientists do is look for “apparent” anomalies - things that cannot be immediately explained, or (even worse) are just quirky coincidences. Often they also look at the edges of detectability where data becomes fuzzy and anomalies are easier to imagine. Think of the fuzzy pictures of Bigfoot or UFOs, with believers looking at details smaller than the resolution of the images and declaring the presence of anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They imagine that if they can find (broadly defined) anomalies in that data that would point to another phenomenon at work. They then commit a pair of logical fallacies. First, the confuse unexplained with unexplainable. This leads them to prematurely declare something a true anomaly, without first exhaustively trying to explain it with conventional means. Second they use the argument from ignorance, saying that because we cannot explain an anomaly that means their specific pet theory must be true. I don’t know what that fuzzy obect in the sky is - therefore it is an alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What pseudoscientists often fail to recognize is that if you take any complex natural phenomenon, historical event, object or process and you look for apparent anomalies (broadly defined), you will find them. Humans are great at pattern recognition, and so if you look for coincidence in the data you will detect them. You will also find features that resulted from a complex interplay if unique events and therefore will be impossible to prove a specific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JFK conspiracy theorists are masters of anomaly hunting. The events of that day were confused and panicked, on all sides. It would be amazing if you couldn’t find many unusual features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Hoagland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the absolute king of anomaly hunting must be Richard Hoagland. He can turn anything into a conspiracy - and not just any conspiracy, but his specific bizarre belief system in alien civilizations, NASA cover ups, and tetrahedrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently pointed to &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/moon1.htm"&gt;this essay by Hoagland&lt;/a&gt; on the Saturnian moon Iapetus. Iapetus is genuinely a cool world, with very unusual geology. We are still in the process of exploring this moon, generating hypotheses as to what processes could have created its unique features, and then testing those hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at this point in our exploration of the solar system and the universe it should be expected that most new things we discover will be new an interesting, not familiar and explained. There is no reason to think that earth geology should explain the features on other planets and moons that are experiencing and resulted from very different forces and processes than those at work on earth. We also have a very limited data set, with close robotic exploration of a few planets and a few dozen moons. We should expect that we are very far from anything approaching a thorough science of exogeology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hoagland this means that NASA images of other bodies in our solar system is a rich source for anomaly hunting - a hobby he engages in with utter enthusiasm. His essay is just chock full of anomaly hunting -he even uses the term often. Most of his anomalies are not really anomalies, they are not terribly interesting coincidence, or just his favorite tactic of using low-res images and an active imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, about one low-res image of Iapetus he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note (close-up, below) the string of bright, reflecting objects — hanging (somehow …) well above the satellite’s limb ….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/iapetus-architecture6-225x112.jpg" title="iapetus-architecture6" alt="iapetus-architecture6" align="right" height="112" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="225"&gt;There are two explanations for these “floating” objects that would need to be excluded before concluding that they are anomalies requiring the introduction of a new element to explain. The first is that it is just pixelization artifact. Again - this is at the limits of resolution, where Hoagland thrives. But perhaps a more likely explanation is that this is just the peaks of mountains catching the sunlight, while the base is in shadow. Isn’t that exactly what we would expect at the rim of the lighted side of a moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is about the level of Hoaglands anomalies. But the central anomaly of this website is the “wall” of Iapetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iapetus is shaped somewhat like a walnut, with a ridge that goes around its equator. Something funky definitely happened to Iapetus to create this ridge, and astronomers are having fun trying to figure out exactly what that was. Hoagland, however, leaps (with some fancy pirouettes, a double twist and a flourish) to the conclusion that the ridge is a manufactured wall. He then uses his “low res” trick to imagine “anomalies” in the ridge, then uses the logical fallacy one-two punch (confusing unexplained with unexplainable and the argument from ignorance) to conclude that aliens not only constructed a wall around Iapetus, they constructed Iapetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hoagland’s enemy, his arch-nemesis, is the ever increasing resolution with which NASA images the solar system. This was his undoing with the infamous “face on Mars” photo that Hoagland championed. Later higher resolution images showed the face on Mars to be a natural formation. Hoagland recovered, however, by claiming (you guessed it) a NASA conspiracy. &lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/iapetus.jpg" title="iapetus" alt="iapetus" align="right" height="200" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="218"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His essay is largely built on the low-res pictures from the Voyager probes with some images from Cassini. He has not yet updated the site with the higher resolution pictures of Iapetus from Cassini. With these higher resolution images Hoagland’s wall look suspiciously like a natural mountain range - albeit one unfamiliar to earth-bound observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course these images are coming from NASA so Hoagland should have no difficulty dismissing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscientists, like Hoagland, abuse the concept of anomalies in many ways. They look for apparent anomalies, then prematurely conclude they are true anomalies, and use them to confirm a conclusion they already had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They fail to recognize that finding apparent anomalies or coincidences is not predictive that a new phenomenon is actually at work. Life is full of apparent anomalies and coincidence, and we evolved the pattern-recognition software to find them and be compelled by them.  That is the ultimate cognitive pitfall of anomaly hunting, and why we need science and skepticism to ward against such pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't actually blogged about "science on the telly" before, which is a surprising omission for a blogger who covers the topics I do. I've wanted to write a piece for yonks, but every time I start it I end up wanting to slit my wrists by about the third paragraph. This time though I'm going to start with the positives, because these are the shows that ironically undermine the point that Sykes tries and fails to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a&gt;BBC Natural History Unit&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;i&gt;peerless&lt;/i&gt; in their ability to bring the magic of nature into our living rooms. They single-handedly justify the license fee. Another stunning example is the BBC's program &lt;a&gt;Coast&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a subject that on the face of it sounds a bit dull, and turns it into unmissable television. &lt;a&gt;Alice Roberts'&lt;/a&gt; work on Coast and on her own show "Don't Die Young" is simply brilliant, with complex biology clearly explained and described. If I get swine flu, I want Alice Roberts to treat me, because she is awesome. Then there's Bruce Parry, who is an anthropologist in all but job title, a modest BAFTA award-winner who has made some of the finest documentaries in the recent years, &lt;a&gt;embedding himself in tribes around the world&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a&gt;journeying the length of the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.  In my fantasy life, I want David Attenborough to be my Granddad, Alice Roberts to be my doctor, and that Robert Peston bloke to do my finances while I share a few pints with my mate Bruce Parry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's these positives that undermine the point Kathy Sykes makes, because I don't really know of anyone who pillories Coast, or Alice, or the Natural History Unit or Bruce Parry for "dumbing down." The reason for this is quite simple - the presenters, writers and production team clearly know and understand and care about their subjects to the extent that they speak with &lt;i&gt;genuine authority&lt;/i&gt;. Alice Roberts can look at a bare skeleton and turn it into a person; Bruce Parry can walk into a tribe anywhere in the world and show that they are people just like us; and David Attenborough can walk you through the history of life, from the first single-celled organisms to the ascent of Man in one glorious afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I want to look at some of the specific things that Kathy Sykes says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...we're making life hard for ourselves by forever criticising each other's efforts or denouncing journalists and film-makers for not portraying science in ways we approve of. While healthy debate can improve science communication, I think we could all shut up a bit, and stop the more rabid criticism altogether. I include myself here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the irony of telling people to stop debating in an article calculated to increase the level of debate, my reaction to this is "what's the problem?" We &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be critical, we &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; as scientists point out where we don't think our message is being adequately communicated. Do you think that people like David Attenborough achieved their success by saying things like "oh that'll do"? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're creating TV shows for millions of people or just writing on a humble blog for a few thousand, the day that you start discouraging or ignoring criticism is the day you stop trying to produce your best work. It's &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of criticism that I make sure my arguments are reasonably sound; it's &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of criticism that I thoroughly weed out mistakes in spelling, it's &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of criticism that I try to make sure any claims I make are properly cited; and it's &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of criticism that I sometimes return to topics in an effort to do them better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As just one example of excessive criticism, the editor of BBC TV's flagship science series Horizon is regularly barraged with complaints from angry scientists about "dumbing down", particularly in response to the programmes that attract people who don't usually watch science. I think we should be grateful for the new viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sykes seems to believe - like many - that in order to attract more viewers you have to dumb down. Bollocks. I don't want to keep tediously linking back to these examples, but the shows I've talked about prove that dumbing-down is not a prerequisite for attracting big audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And besides, the scientists who complain aren't necessarily moaning about "dumbing down"; they're concerned that complex messages are oversimplified to the extent that they are no longer factually accurate. Examples of this abound, such as Horizon's &lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/30679"&gt;appalling coverage of the LHC&lt;/a&gt;, that focused on crank claims of black holes swallowing the Earth. In other words, the makers of Horizon say things that simply aren't backed up by science. What is the point of bringing in more viewers if you are simply going to tell them nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sykes' argument really disintegrates when she tries to defend a recent New Scientist cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, New Scientist recently took flak over its cover that proclaimed "Darwin was wrong". The article inside described discoveries that are leading to modifications to the theory of evolution. A cheap trick to sell magazines while giving fodder to the enemies of evolution? Sales certainly went up that week, but if more people than usual bought the magazine and read the article, more people will have found that scientists agree that Darwin was fundamentally right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's okay that the headline on the cover was basically a lie, because the article said something completely different. This has to be one of the most hare-brained justifications for this practise that I've ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Horizon examples, it points to a lack of imagination and/or ability on the part of editors and producers. If you're incapable of presenting a piece of information without having to misrepresent or alter the content first, then perhaps you just aren't very good at communicating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the thought police who castigate communicators for simplifying, selling out or making things too accessible...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I went from feeling disappointed by the article to becoming downright annoyed. How in the world does healthy criticism become "the thought police"? And again, it's a complete misrepresentation of valid concerns. Sykes suggests that scientists are just being elitist, when the concern is about accuracy, and ultimately &lt;i&gt;truth&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in many cases communicators are passionate about science and are simply trying to communicate it as clearly as they can to as large an audience as possible. We risk drowning out what's good with a stream of public bickering. We also risk discouraging a new generation of communicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that we don't want to be overly harsh on young presenters starting out, in truth I'm struggling to see where this problem is. Can Sykes name communicators who were discouraged? Were they discouraged because of overly harsh criticism, or because they simply weren't very good? And is there any evidence to suggest that the debate (or "bickering" if you want to trivialize the issue) over communication has the slightest bit of effect on the television audience? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're still troubled by how others communicate, why not spend less time ranting and get out there and communicate in ways you do like? Blogging is easier than ever, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is &lt;i&gt;harder&lt;/i&gt; than ever. There are millions of blogs out there, jostling for position. Dragging The Lay Scientist up to the position it's in now has taken me fourteen months of solid effort. That's why bloggers can become so frustrated with mainstream coverage. Blogs like Effect Measure for example produce &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/"&gt;some of the best coverage&lt;/a&gt; of events like the current Swine Flu outbreak that you will find anywhere. UK science bloggers have a record of breaking stories ahead of the mainstream press. Yet all of the world's science blogs combined struggle to match the impact of one lousy columnist in a second-rate tabloid rag. And of course many scientists don't have time to blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why the suggestion that "if you don't like it, go and do it yourself" just doesn't work, and why scientists will continue to criticize shows that fail to present an accurate or interesting message. Whether Kathy Sykes likes it or not, the complaints will keep coming. You don't hear the likes of Attenborough complaining that "the scientists are being too harsh", and that's why he is an internationally famous living legend, the top dog of science communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the science communicators of tomorrow want the criticism to stop, they'll have to look at shows like Tribe, Coast and Life on Earth, and start upping their game. Because we're not putting up, or shutting up. &lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, about a year ago, I was stunned at how utterly credulous one TV reporter was about--of all things--&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_orbs_invade_the.php"&gt;orbs&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, &lt;em&gt;orbs&lt;/em&gt;! Even dedicated ghosthunters don't push orbs much anymore, realizing that they are nothing more than reflections or specks of dust reflecting lights in photographs. Then there's Steve Wilson and his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php"&gt;forays into anti-vaccine nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, in which he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative_reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;recycles some of the oldest, most tired, most highly debunked canards&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, it's been some additional &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/more_lousy_health_reporting_in.php"&gt;crappy reporting about Gardasil&lt;/a&gt; and a r&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php"&gt;ecent "autism" conference&lt;/a&gt; that was in reality nothing more than an autism quackfest. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I learned that yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com"&gt;The Detroit Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20090420/NEWS01/90420047/"&gt;won a Pulitzer Prize&lt;/a&gt; for its reporting on the text message scandal that brought down Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick last year and has embarked on an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/business/media/31paper.html"&gt;innovative but risky experiment&lt;/a&gt; in which it only delivers newspapers three days a week and provides the rest online, could apparently use some of that reporting chops and business savvy in dealing with health reporting. I'm referring to some serious badness that appeared in its Sunday edition, a one-two punch of woo that decimated in one fell swoop its credibility on health issues. Sadly, this sort of thing is all too typical of local newspapers, but when they hit my hometown paper, one I've been reading for well over 30 years on and off even when I didn't live in Detroit anymore; so I couldn't let it pass unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with item one, which appeared in the Life section under "Health" and reads like a paid infomercial more than anything else, an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904260325"&gt;Detox at Detroit's De'Spa Elite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/quackery_and_faith_healing_in_motown.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/quackery_and_faith_healing_in_motown.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/8RqwsZcVjYA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240834733245"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3431">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5fe07eb616d2a10a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ask an Entomologist"/><category term="Gardening"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Annelida"/><category term="Oligochaeta"/><category term="Polychaeta"/><category term="worm"/><title type="html">Do Earthworms have hairs?</title><published>2009-04-27T11:20:26Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T11:20:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/do-earthworms-have-hairs/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey–apparently I missed &lt;a href="http://other95.blogspot.com/2009/04/happy-earthworm-day.html"&gt;International Earthworm Day&lt;/a&gt;!  So–here’s something wormy for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people don’t realize that &lt;a href="http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/IN047"&gt;earthworms&lt;/a&gt;, like their cousins the &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/annelida/polyintro.html"&gt;polychaete&lt;/a&gt; worms, also have hairs on each segment.  Earthworms have tiny, hard to see bristles called &lt;em&gt;setae&lt;/em&gt;.  While you can’t see them easily, you can feel them–gently stroke a worm from tail to front, and you’ll quickly feel these little spiny setae.&lt;a href="http://www.infovisual.info/02/007_en.html"&gt;&lt;img title="earthwormxs" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/earthwormxs.jpg?w=273&amp;amp;h=188" alt="earthwormxs" width="273" height="188"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though earthworms have no bones, their segmented system of muscles enables them to alternate between being stubby and thick, and long and slender.  This, in conjunction with the setae, allow the worm to anchor themselves in the dirt, either holding themselves in place (if a bird is tugging), or providing an anchor to push against as they tunnel forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; are we talking about hairy worms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, I &lt;a title="well....it might be a worm...." href="http://judgeabook.blogspot.com/2009/04/phriday-hall-of-phame-and-shame.html"&gt;linked to an illustration of a worm&lt;/a&gt;, and asked if it might actually be a giant phallic extraterrestrial earthworm (you’ve been warned). Someone then suggested it was more properly a Polychaete. &lt;em&gt;Au Contraire!&lt;/em&gt; Polychaetes usually have fleshy body extensions called &lt;a title="a nice anatomy article" href="http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-03/rs/index.php"&gt;parapodia&lt;/a&gt; surrounding their hairs.&lt;a href="http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-03/rs/index.php"&gt;&lt;img title="parapodia" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/parapodia.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=112" alt="parapodia" width="150" height="112"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.infovisual.info/02/007_en.html"&gt;VisualInfo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-03/rs/index.php"&gt;Reefkeeping&lt;/a&gt; for images.&lt;/p&gt;

Trout is responsible for suggesting the term "explanatory neurophilia" to describe the fact that "&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;non-expert consumers of behavioral explanations assign greater standing to explanations that contain neuroscientific details, even if these details provide no additional explanatory value"&lt;/span&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.jdtrout.com/sites/default/files/ExplanatoryNeurophilia_0.pdf"&gt;Seduction without cause: uncovering explanatory neurophilia&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, 12(8): 281-282 2008).  This terminological innovation may confuse a few biologists who already use &lt;em&gt;neurophilia&lt;/em&gt; to describe substances or processes with a special affinity for nervous tissue, but it's useful for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bring all this up again today? Because &lt;a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/%7Edeenasw/index.html"&gt;Deena Weisberg&lt;/a&gt; is speaking in the &lt;a href="http://www.neuroethics.upenn.edu/talk_series.html"&gt;Penn Neuroethics Program Talk Series&lt;/a&gt; today at noon on "Explanatory neurophilia: How it happens and how it can be prevented."  I'm especially eager to hear about the "how it can be prevented" part.  Unfortunately, I have a site visit today that will probably prevent me from going to her talk, but I hope to learn about the content by other means, and will reveal the recommended prophylaxis when I learn what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240831472570"><id gr:original-id="534 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce2ecd4519cb40ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="swine flu" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/651"/><category term="xkcd" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/652"/><title type="html">Swine Flu on Twitter</title><published>2009-04-27T09:05:18Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T09:05:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/534" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.com"&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A few things came up, but nothing terribly worthy of ridicule. "Lysenko" was likewise bereft of comedic value. I decided, therefore, to go for broke. I set my search parameters to cover only the "Metaphysical" section, and I entered into the search box one word: "poop."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, something came up. And yes, it is worth writing about. I speak of...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ANCIENT-Coprolite-FOSSIL-DINO-POOP-Carved-Crystal-Skull_W0QQitemZ220342798297QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item220342798297&amp;amp;_trksid=p3286.m20.l1116#ebayphotohosting"&gt;Item Number  220342798297: ANCIENT Coprolite FOSSIL DINO POOP Carved Crystal Skull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a skull carved out of poo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SfVz2ZZKBZI/AAAAAAAAAkc/hw358RO948s/s1600-h/pooskull.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:221px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SfVz2ZZKBZI/AAAAAAAAAkc/hw358RO948s/s320/pooskull.jpg" border="0" alt="" title="If only Indy 4 had been about one of these."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first thing one sees, after a gaudy graphic of a pair of ravens, is scrolling text that reads:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Symbol of The Higher Mind, The Stone of Gravity!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ah yes, poop: truly it doth bespeak a high-minded tendency of thought, and doth show unto many its own gravity as &lt;i&gt;exeunt&lt;/i&gt; many logs into the privy-hole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another graphic then welcomes the intrepid poo-buyer, saying "Welcome, Seekers of the Light!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dunno about you, but if I was looking for poo, I don't think I'd be a seeker of the light, and if I was a seeker of the light, I don't think I'd be looking for poo. Unless someone was using a cowpie to start a fire in a dark forest or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is one of the most unusual and unique varieties of carved skulls!&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'll say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been hand-carved from Fossilized Dinosaur Poop, properly known as Coprolite.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I was a little surprised and a lot disappointed to find that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolite"&gt;she didn't make that up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This fossil is from Colorado and is 150+ million years old, dating to the Jurassic period of history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I know it's easy but I have to say it. Spielburg's next: &lt;i&gt;Jurassic Shart&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is GEM QUALITY Coprolite, it is highly silicated and very solid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;How does one determine whether or not poo is "gem quality?" What does it even &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt; for poo to be "gem quality?" Does it have many facets? Or is it just shiny?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This special skull possesses especially lovely patterns! It also has a small, visually discreet superficial fissure near the cranial crown. Please take a look at my photos below for several views of this mind-blowing skull!&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm sure it blows &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, lady, but it ain't my mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't worry, there are no nefarious odors lingering around this skull!  It is indeed as hard as a rock! &lt;/blockquote&gt;Hence the word "fossil."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Who else in your neighbourhood (or town, or even state!) has a Fossilized Dinosaur Poop Skull?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nobody, and, quite frankly, I bet there's a reason for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The polish is a wonderful high-gloss, making this skull pleasing in the hands, and easy on the eyes!&lt;/blockquote&gt;So you can polish a turd even if you're not a Mythbuster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Metaphysically, the Symbol of the Skull represents The Higher Mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'd figure it would represent the "Harder Head."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To attain the higher mind of spiritual awareness and psychic ability&lt;br&gt;we must be released from the thrall of the lower cognitive mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So what's the reptile brain, then? The Nethermind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Skull also symbolizes Change, which is truly the great healer of all situations, conditions, and troubles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, now you're full of it. Barack Obama symbolizes change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Without Change in our lives, we do not spiritually grow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Or use the pop machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my experience that working with a Crystal Skull is a multi-dimensional journey of discovery, enlightenment, and growth.  They can be excellent catalysts for Healing, Dreamwork, Meditation, Past Life Recall, Spiritualism and Self-Improvement on many levels. &lt;/blockquote&gt;It can also communicate telepathically, scare off giant ants, and bring dead aliens back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Metaphysically, Coprolite is called The Stone of Gravity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hee hee...Plop! [/Beavis].&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the need to expel that which is no longer of any use or service.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If it is no longer of any use or service, &lt;i&gt;why the hell are you selling it on eBay for almost 150 dollars?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Releasing oneself of all 'unneeded baggage' is the first step in healing on any level!&lt;/blockquote&gt;And it's fun, too, especially if you have a good book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Coprolite vibrates to the number 2&lt;/blockquote&gt;Heh heh. Number 2. Heh heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;it is associated with the Astrological signs of Aries and Virgo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The god of war and the virgin? That one's no fun at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Quoth Raven:  "The best way to remove temptation is to give in to it!" &lt;/blockquote&gt;And I am &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; tempted to buy a skull made out of poo.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What we have here is a syndrome that has not been shown to exist, with alleged causes that might be erroneously attributed to autism, and with symptoms that haven&amp;#39;t been shown to be associated with the alleged causes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sound familiar? This is no different to crankery like &amp;quot;autistic enterocolitis&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;mercury-induced autism.&amp;quot; Except the promotion of CADD has the potential to result in a lot more direct damage to the personal lives of autistic adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/09/maxine-astons-cassandra-disorder-scam.html"&gt;Maxine Aston&amp;#39;s Cassandra Disorder Scam&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Have you ever thought about how much fun it would be to invent a bogus disorder and to rake in the money from persuading gullible people that they were in dire need of your expertise and therapy? No, me neither. Most of us are ethical enough so that we would never consider such a thing. But Maxine Aston, notorious inventor of &amp;quot;Cassandra Affective Deprivation Disorder,&amp;quot; evidently has no such qualms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later in the interview, Jenny said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f___ing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny is of course trotting out the old myth that measles is harmless, a claim she and other anti-vaccinationists (or those proclaiming infants should only receive a whopping 2 vaccines) make repeatedly. They also laugh at the doctors warning of the risks of possible epidemics chicken pox, flu, and many other diseases that have become perceived as harmless in our post-vaccine world. And one of the many diseases folks like Jenny would gladly trade for their kids’ autism is whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the parents of 4-month-old Dana McCaffery, like everyone else, didn’t have that choice because autism has nothing to do with vaccines. But since Dana was too young to be vaccinated against whooping couch, which Jerry Kartzine and Jenny McCarthy would advise not being vaccinated for at all (at least not for a long time), Dana is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something tells me that if Dana’s parents had the choice Jenny imagines, they would now happily have chosen autism over their daugher’s whooping cough, especially considering their community was largely unvaccinated ensuring that Dana couldn’t take advantage of herd immunity for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/dana-mccaffery-another-victim-of-anti-vaccinationists/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/N-63XHXxTM4/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not your “f___ing fault”, Jenny? Maybe you didn’t personally pull the trigger but Dana McCaffery is a victim of the very ideology you promote in your books. Whooping cough is not 1 of the 2 vaccines you and Kartzine advise parents to get for their children. Dana McCaffery is on you, &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/autismdenial.html"&gt;as are these children here&lt;/a&gt;. And unless you reject this madness, there will me more children’s blood on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s where scientists and physicians take the results of preclinical studies performed &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; in biochemical assays and cell culture models and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; in animal models to humans. There are numerous reasons for this, not the least of which that preclinical models, contrary to what animal rights activists would like you to believe, do not predict human responses to new therapeutic agents as much as we would like. However, the single biggest reason that we cannot answer questions in human studies as easily as we can in cell culture and animal studies is ethics. Of course, answering questions using cell culture and animal studies is not “easy,” either, but performing studies using human beings as subjects is an order of magnitude (at least) more difficult because the potential to cause harm exists, and if harm is caused by the experimental treatment under study, that harm will be done to human beings, rather than cells in a dish or mice bred for research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “gold standard” type of study that we do to test the efficacy of a new drug is known as the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, often abbreviated RCT. Indeed, this remains the gold standard and is accorded the highest level of “power” in the framework of evidence-based medicine. Of course, as we have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=48"&gt;argued time and time again&lt;/a&gt;, using the RCT to test therapies that are incredibly implausible on a strictly scientific basis (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=242"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, for instance) inevitably leads to numerous “false positives” in which the therapy appears to produce results statistically significantly better than the control. John Ioannidis has done numerous &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16060722"&gt;clever analyses&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrate how easily clinical research is led astray if it is not grounded in scientific plausibility. Indeed, the &lt;a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/why_most_publis.html"&gt;probability of false positive studies increases&lt;/a&gt;, the more improbable the modality. It is for these very reasons that we have proposed the concept of science-based medicine, which takes into account estimates of prior probability based on preclinical studies and basic scientific principles, rather than evidence-based medicine, which does not. Indeed, Wally Sampson has even proposed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=63"&gt;a “plausibility scale” for rating RCTs&lt;/a&gt;, and Steve Novella has pointed out how &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=262"&gt;difficult it can be&lt;/a&gt; to interpret the medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside all of these issues, to which a whole series of posts could be devoted (and, indeed, to which a whole series of posts has been devoted by Kimball Atwood, Steve Novella, and Wally Sampson), I want to look at the ethical precepts that guide clinical trials and why they render it much more difficult to answer some questions. To the shame of the medical profession, these ethical precepts are a relatively recent phenomenon dating back only a few decades at most. Some of the impetus for these rules derived, not surprisingly, from the horrific medical experiments that the Nazis and Japanese performed on prisoners during World War II. Virtually everyone’s heard, for instance, of Dr. Mengele and his experiments on twins, but there was more–&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/3540339/How-Hitler-perverted-the-course-of-science.html"&gt;so much more&lt;/a&gt;–that the Nazis did, including testing the effects of immersion in ice water to simulate what sailors forced to abandon ship or pilots shot down over the ocean might experience and to test ways to rewarm them and save their lives; placing prisoners in vacuum chambers to test the effects of high altitude (which had obvious applications to how their pilots could deal with high altitude); sewing glass, foreign objects, or gauze impregnated with bacteria into wounds in order to test means of preventing and treating gangrene; smashing prisoner’s bones with a hammer in order to simulate more realistically war wounds; and the use of radiation aimed at the ovaries in order to sterilize quickly Jewish women and other “undesirables,” at the cost of horrific radiation injury to the surrounding bowels because the technology to aim radiation beams was very crude then. The Japanese &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-439776/Doctors-Depravity.html"&gt;were no slouches&lt;/a&gt; at depraved medical experiments, either, performing “dissections” on prisoners while they were still alive; testing phosgene gas on prisoners; decapitating prisoners to test the sharpness of blades; amputating limbs to study shock due to hemorrhage; performing gastrectomies and testing reattachments of the esophagus to various parts of the intestinal tract; and testing the effect of various pathogenic microorganisms on prisoners to see what inoculum was necessary to cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, formally known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Study_of_Untreated_Syphilis_in_the_Negro_Male"&gt;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male&lt;/a&gt;. Carried out between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service, the study &lt;a href="http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/Story.asp?s=1207586"&gt;involved 399 African-American men with syphilis&lt;/a&gt; who were studied to determine the effects of untreated syphilis in black men as opposed to whites, the hypothesis being that whites experience more neurological complications due to syphilis, whereas blacks were thought to be more susceptible to cardiovascular damage. What horrified the nation in 1972, when details of the experiment were first reported Jean Heller of the Associated Press, was that the study continued after the 1940s, when penicillin had been validated as curative for syphilis. The experiment also involved &lt;a href="http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/Story.asp?s=1207586"&gt;considerable deception&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the experiment, 28 of the men had died directly of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications, 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their children had been born with congenital syphilis. How had these men been induced to endure a fatal disease in the name of science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To persuade the community to support the experiment, one of the original doctors admitted it “was necessary to carry on this study under the guise of a demonstration and provide treatment.” At first, the men were prescribed the syphilis remedies of the day —bismuth, neoarsphenamine, and mercury— but in such small amounts that only 3 percent showed any improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These token doses of medicine were good public relations and did not interfere with the true aims of the study. Eventually, all syphilis treatment was replaced with “pink medicine” —aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the men would show up for a painful and potentially dangerous spinal tap, the PHS doctors misled them with a letter full of promotional hype: “Last Chance for Special Free Treatment.” The fact that autopsies would eventually be required was also concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a doctor explained, “If the colored population becomes aware that accepting free hospital care means a post-mortem, every darky will leave Macon County…” Even the Surgeon General of the United States participated in enticing the men to remain in the experiment, sending them certificates of appreciation after 25 years in the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until 25 years after the revelation of the ethics violations that had occurred during the Tuskegee syphilis experiment were revealed that the U.S. government acknowledged how wrong the experiment had been and &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/jul/tuskegee/"&gt;then President Clinton formally apologized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to these sorts of abuses, efforts were undertaken, both in the U.S. and internationally, to codify ethical principles that would prevent such atrocities and abuses. In the aftermath of World War II, the first major effort to regulate medical research was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code"&gt;Nuremberg Code&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed from the verdict of the Doctors’ Trial in 1947. There were ten points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No experiment should be conducted where there is a prior reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Taken from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; reprinted from Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10, Vol. 2, pp. 181-182. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1949.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the &lt;a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm"&gt;Declaration of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; developed by the World Medical Association in 1964 and The Belmont Report in the United States. It in essence expanded upon the principles of the Nuremberg Code (more on how later). In the aftermath of the Tuskegee experiment and in response to other ethical violations in human subjects research, the former United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (renamed to Health and Human Services) produced a document entitled “Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research,” more commonly called &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/belmontArchive.html"&gt;The Belmont Report&lt;/a&gt;, for the Belmont Convention Center, where the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974-1978) met to draft the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belmont Report identified three essential aspects of any human subjects research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm#xrespect"&gt;Respect for persons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This principle demands that persons be treated as autonomous agents with self-determination and that persons unable to exercise autonomous self-determination (children, the mentally ill) or who could be easily coerced (prisoners) are entitled to protections for their interests. In brief, this means that research subjects must be accorded full understanding of the risks and potential benefits of participating in a research study, as well as full autonomy (i.e., the right to refuse to participate without fear of repercussions or that their medical care may be compromised).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm#xbenefit"&gt;Beneficence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This principle can be boiled down to (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. Thus, the scientific design of the experiment must not be excessively risky for participants and must have sound science behind it suggesting that a therapy is likely to be of benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm#xjust"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Research must be fair, including (and potentially benefiting) as many groups as possible. Key quote: “For example, the selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order to determine whether some classes (e.g., welfare patients, particular racial and ethnic minorities, or persons confined to institutions) are being systematically selected simply because of their easy availability, their compromised position, or their manipulability, rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being studied. Finally, whenever research supported by public funds leads to the development of therapeutic devices and procedures, justice demands both that these not provide advantages only to those who can afford them and that such research should not unduly involve persons from groups unlikely to be among the beneficiaries of subsequent applications of the research.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the Belmont Report, the U.S. Government eventually formulated the &lt;a href="http://ori.dhhs.gov/education/products/ucla/chapter2/page04b.htm"&gt;Common Rule&lt;/a&gt; (full DHHS regulations &lt;a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_99/45cfr46_99.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which mandates that all federally-funded human research and all human research designed to obtain FDA approval must be overseen by committees known as Institutional Review Boards, independent bodies that guarantee that human subjects are protected according to the Belmont Report and all applicable federal regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Helsinki Declaration represents an ongoing international effort to come up with a set of ethical principles to guide human subjects research. It is not a legally binding treaty but nonetheless now serves as the cornerstone of document in human research ethics. Despite its not being codified as a treaty, the Helsinki Declaration draws its power and authority based on how much of it has been codified into legislation and regulations in a large number of countries.  The first version, released in 1964, promulgated ten principles based upon the original ten principles of the Nuremberg Code. Since then the Helsinki Declaration has undergone six revisions, the most recent of which occurred in October 2008. The first revision, in 1975, introduced the concept of an independent oversight board for all human subjects research, which influenced the requirement for an IRB in the Common Rule in the United States. In its current form, the Helsinki Declaration has introduced additional protections that are relevant to this blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed this time and time again on SBM: the concept of prior probability. It is the very reason that so much research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is, at the very least, of dubious ethics, especially for highly improbable modalities like homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;. The reason is that testing these modalities on human subjects does not conform to generally accepted scientific principles and is not based on proper preclinical experimentation. Indeed, a discussion of this very issue has broken out in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=244"&gt;comments of a post&lt;/a&gt; here at SBM about a trial of massage therapy for HIV/AIDS, and I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=82"&gt;expressed grave concern over the ethics of a trial&lt;/a&gt; of homeopathy for infectious childhood diarrheal diseases in a Third World country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, here’s one reason why placebo-controlled research is becoming more and more uncommmon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the very reason why most clinical trials now examine the addition of a new drug to the standard of care or a new drug versus the standard of care, rather than true placebo-controlled trials. Exceptions occur for self-limited conditions, such as hot flashes during menopause or headach therapies, but not for more serious conditions and certainly not for life-threatening conditions like cancer. Indeed, very few cancer therapy trials have a placebo control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the totality of ethical considerations that must be applied to human subjects research, it is easy to understand why we cannot always do the “definitive” experiment to answer a scientific question about the efficacy of a new therapy. For example, in surgical trials, with rare exceptions, it is not ethically acceptable to do “sham” surgery on a control group because that subjects patients to all risks and no benefit, as I have discussed before for trials of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=56"&gt;total mesorectal excision&lt;/a&gt; for rectal cancer and a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=374"&gt;clinical trial testing the routine use of nasogastric tubes&lt;/a&gt; for GI surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that sham surgery controls haven’t been used before. Indeed, they have. For example, a randomized, sham surgery-controlled trial is how it was originally determined that poudrage for revascularizing the heart and treating angina was no better than placebo. First developed in the 1930s, poudrage was based on the concept that irritating the pericardium would provoke an inflammatory response that would lead to the influx of blood vessels into the heart muscle, and this irritation was accomplished by opening the chest and sprinkling sterile talcum powder in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. (In the era before heart-lung bypass technology, it was not possible to consider revascularizing the heart directly.) As is the case for so many CAM modalities, results, as far as relieving the symptoms of angina, looked good–-in uncontrolled studies. Poudrage was the rage as a treatment for angina for at least a decade. Then, in the 1950s, a randomized trial was performed with a sham surgery control arm in which one group of patients had their chests opened, but no powder sprinkled in the pericardial sac around the heart. The other got standard poudrage. There was no difference in symptoms or other measures of cardiac symptomatology between the two groups. (Surgery itself is a very powerful placebo.) This was one of the very first and most famous randomized trials of a surgical intervention with sham surgery as the control. Poudrage was abandoned, and it is now relegated to being a historical curiosity in the history of surgery. It was not the only procedure for angina pectoris found when actually tested to have effects based primarily on the placebo effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may imagine, based on the latest iteration of the Helsinki Declaration, it is unlikely–to say the least–that such a study would be approved by an IRB in the U.S., although two more recent trials have been done, as this excellent discussion of the ethics of sham surgery in surgical clinical trials mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been very few sham controlled surgical trials to date. In 1959, Cobb published a study showing no difference in improvement between patients undergoing internal mammary artery ligature versus a sham operation for treatment of angina pectoris. In recent years, two studies were done to evaluate the intracranial implantation of fetal neural cells for Parkinson’s disease. These studies had some of the study patients randomized to a sham operation that required simulating all aspects of the surgery, including the drilling of burr holes on the skull under anesthesia. In the field of orthopaedics, Moseley et al. in 2002 evaluated the effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery for arthritis of the knee. In this study, one group received a full arthroscopic debridement, one group underwent arthroscopic lavage with irrigation fluid alone, and the last group had three one-centimeter sham incisions but no actual procedure performed. This study concluded that arthroscopic surgeries done for advanced arthritis were no more effective than the sham operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical rules laid down by a combination of the Nuremberg Code, the Belmont Report, and the Helsinki Declaration are also the reason why one of the latest talking points of antivaccinationists, a “randomized” study of unvaccinated versus vaccinated children, is ethically not permissible. The reasons are obvious. it would require that the control group of children in the placebo-controlled group be intentinoally left completely unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases. There would also be the practical issue that antivaccine parents wouldn’t sign up for such a study because their irrational fear of vaccination would prevent them from agreeing to the possibility of randomization to the vaccination group, and parents grounded in science-based medicine would never be foolish enough to allow their children to be randomized to the no vaccine placebo group. Indeed, not too long ago an antivaccine commenter on this very blog &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256#comment-9742"&gt;proposed just such a study&lt;/a&gt;, and I told him &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256#comment-9746"&gt;why it would be unethical&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256#comment-9767"&gt;no uncertain terms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, true to form, after making a brain-meltingly specious analogy that he seems to think a slam-dunk, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; founder and anti-vaccine zealot extraordinaire J.B. Handley &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/one-wing.html"&gt;makes a huge straw man&lt;/a&gt; out of the ethical and scientific arguments against doing a “vaxed versus unvaxed” study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at unvaccinated kids is either impossible (due to confounders) or unethical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at adverse events based on giving children 6 vaccines, the way we do in the actual schedule, has never happened and never will, because of the “Helsinki Declaration”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one ever said that comparing the rates of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism in unvaccinated children compared to vaccinated children is impossible or unethical. What we argue is that looking at unvaccinated children &lt;em&gt;in the manner demanded by anti-vaccine zealots like J.B. Handley&lt;/em&gt; is unethical (the randomized, placebo-controlled “vaxed versus antivaxed” study some anti-vaccine zealots demand) or far more difficult to control for confounders than those as full of the arrogance of ignorance as J.B. Handley assume. Indeed, Prometheus has written three excellent posts [&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=100"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=121"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; (of the three, #3 is the most detailed) describing what it would take to do a scientifically and epidemioligcally rigorous study comparing neurodevelopmental outcomes in vaccinated versus unvaccinated children. Suffice it to say, that such a rigorous study is not what the antivaccine movement wants and that doing such a study would be far more complicated, expensive, and difficult than the simplistic view of our commenter or J.B., who seems to view ethical concerns as nothing more than made-up impediments to his getting his way rather than what they are: Legitimate rules designed to protect research subjects. I also suspect that J.B. knows this but keeps demanding such a study because to the ignorant it gives him the appearance of being on the scientific high ground. An alternate explanation for the insistence by anti-vaccine zealots is that the truly believe that vaccines are so harmful that it’s more ethical not to administer them than it is to administer them. In other words, to them the unvaccinated group would be less likely to incur harm) than to administer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said time and time again, where the “rubber meets the road” (so to speak) in science-based medicine is the clinical trial. Part of that ethical framework, in my view and I daresay the views of my co-bloggers, is that, before subjecting any human being to the potential risks of a clinical trial, there must be nothing but the most rigorous science supporting the hypothesis to be tested, backed up by preclinical data in the form of biochemistry, cell culture, and animal studies. In addition, because the subjects of such trials are human beings, even when there is a scientifically compelling and well-supported hypothesis being tested, the welfare of the subjects must take precedence over rigorous scientific design whenever there is a conflict between the two. Over 100 years of surgical research shows that it is possible to produce compelling evidence for the efficacy of a surgical procedure without necessarily having a sham surgery placebo control group and double-blinding of the participants (given that it’s nearly always impossible to blind the operating surgeon to the operation done), but it is much more difficult. Non-blinded prospective trials or sometimes retrospective trials need to be used, requiring many more trials to show a pattern that can overcome the confounding factors inherent in such designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when it comes to issues like vaccination, although we do rigorously test each new vaccine added to the current recommended vaccination schedule in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration precepts, we cannot ethically do a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of “vaccinated versus unvaccinated” children because that would involve leaving the control group unprotected against vaccine-preventable disease. That is a failure to provide the best standard of care as the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; that research subjects receive. In addition, such a trial would fail from an ethical standpoint in another way. Because the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism is not supported by the weight of current evidence, such a trial would be testing a scientifically dubious (at best) hypothesis, which also goes against the Helsinki Declaration. What we are left with, then, are retrospective trials or prospective non-randomized trials requiring large numbers of subjects and careful controls for confounders. The good news is that enough of these trials can be as convincing as the gold standard. Indeed, critics of the RCT sometimes argue that sound epidemiological studies, properly done, can in some cases replace the need for RCTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As trite as it may seem, what this all boils down to is the observation that science-based medicine is hard. Even if you leave aside the questions of how to come to a conclusion regarding the best treatment for a patient based on science, just answering a single question requires not just loads of preclinical data in cell culture and animal models, but well-designed clinical trials. But a well-designed clinical trial is not enough; it has to be ethical. Moreover, the bioethics has been in general evolving towards ever more protection of human research subjects. Indeed, I’m reminded of an HBO movie &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/films/stlm/"&gt;Something The Lord Made&lt;/a&gt; (an excellent, albeit a bit conventional and predictable, movie about one of the “gods” of surgery Alfred Blalock and the poor black carpenter whom he hired as an assistant whose surgical skills were invaluable to Dr. Blalock in achieving what he did). The movie dramatized surgical research in the 1940s, the development of the Blalock-Taussig shunt, and the relationship between Blalock and Thomas. Watching the movie, I remember being amazed at how little it took in the way of discussion and permissions for Dr. Blalock to try out his procedure on infants. Of course, there was no procedure to save such infants back then, who inevitably died, and his assistant Vivien Thomas and he had worked out the procedure in dogs, but the difference between then and now was striking. Indeed, studies that were approved 20 or even 10 years ago might not be approved today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no one, least of all I, would argue that human subjects protections are what they should be (which may be the topic for a future post), I find that comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/index.html"&gt;I am not a puzzle, I am a person&lt;/a&gt;": This is the title of an article in today's &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/index.html"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Svoboda. The article examines the notion of neurodiversity and autistic culture and autism rights. Interviewed are a number of friends, including my co-blogger, Dora; &lt;a href="http://www.thedreamdiver.com/"&gt;Dana Commandatore&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="http://www.thedreamdiver.com/"&gt;Michelangelo the Diver&lt;/a&gt; (which has occupied a prominent place in Charlie's room for some time); Kathleen Seidel, who writes the &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/"&gt;Neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt; blog (essential reading to understand the legal and scientific background of vaccine litigation; and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just about a year ago that an &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/neurodiversity-in-new-york-magazine/"&gt;article on neurodiversity appeared in New York magazine&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/index.html"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; article considers similar topics such as the need to  "redefine autism as something to be valued and protected, not obliterated" and to focus on accepting autism and individuals on the spectrum as they are, rather than trying to change them and make them "normal" like "neurotypicals." Svoboda also considers "the general therapeutic approach to autism in the medical community":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many autistic rights advocates have spoken out against applied behavioral analysis (ABA), the most common type of autism therapy, developed by UCLA psychologist Ivar Lovaas in the 1960s and '70s, with the goal of helping autistic children achieve "normal intellectual and educational" functioning. The therapy, which uses repetition and rewards to reinforce new skills, is geared toward extinguishing autistic behaviors such as "stimming" (making repetitive body movements) and failing to make eye contact. One sign of the treatment's success, Lovaas suggested, might be for school personnel to perceive an autistic child as "indistinguishable" from his or her normal peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seidel (who has a child on the autism spectrum) notes that such approaches "miss the point entirely" and suggests that "[i]nstead of trying to coerce autistic kids to behave like 'neurotypicals,' therapists should focus on helping them deal more effectively with the non-autistic world." Commandatore, also the parent of a child on the spectrum, notes that "[s]afeguarding a child's dignity" and "teaching him to navigate a neurotypical world" don't have to be mutually exclusive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the autistic culture movement may come off as dogmatic at times, Commandatore says the question of how to raise autistic kids in the spirit of neurodiversity has no clear-cut answer. Her child-rearing strategies don't radiate from a single ideological core -- they're more cobbled-together, day-by-day solutions to various issues that crop up. Instead of trying to train her son out of his personality quirks, such as strong reactions to loud and sudden noises, she says, "We've given him headphones that he can use in public, these big 1970s speaker headphones. If he starts to panic, he asks for his headphones and we give them to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commandatore's views about ABA and neurodiversity cohere closely with my own. My husband Jim and I grudgingly assented to Charlie doing ABA some ten years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're humanists---Jim's a cultural historian and I love literature and languages---and the view of human nature promoted by behavior scientist B.F. Skinner has always seemed inimical to our beliefs. We wanted very much to follow a less harsh-seeming approach and the thought of Charlie doing 40 hours a week of therapy seemed simply impossible. But the special ed program offered to us by the St. Paul Public School District, while staffed with kindly people, but made no real efforts to teach Charlie. Indeed, our first  ABA therapists (most of whom were college students) turned out to be the most humane of all: Rather than just clucking their tongues and feeling sorry for Charlie, they sat down in the little purple chair beside Charlie and taught him; they sat beside him on the floor and brainstormed new ways to have fun. They laughed with Charlie, and Jim and I laughed too. They believed that Charlie was capable of what we were teaching him and also of much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later and Charlie is still doing ABA at school. Ten years of education helped him get through his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;recent hearing test&lt;/a&gt; with flying colors. The teachers who Charlie likes best (like his current teacher) have that same attitude of confidence about him: When they say, "he is really smart," they wholeheartedly mean it. Every single thing about Charlie's education----from the schedule books to the flashcards to the programs---is tailored to his needs and learning style, and his teacher keeps the lines of communication open with regular emails and phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's current teacher is remarkable, but not all of his past teachers and therapists have been. Indeed, more than a few who said they had "experience in ABA" did what seemed more like rigid, rote, 1970s behavior modification. Charlie floundered in such classrooms (and with one behavior consultant in particular) and some behaviors worsened. Yet, I don't think that that "ABA" Charlie received in some past classrooms was that different or worse than what you might find in more than a few autism schools and programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences with his current program is that the teacher is well-trained and well-supported, with ready access to an ABA consultant when questions arise. She's also always thinking about Charlie as Charlie and is attuned to his sensory needs; she's aware of his need for intense physical activity, his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simplex_elegans_growing_boy_growing_needs"&gt;ever-growing appetite&lt;/a&gt;, and burgeoning artistic ability. Aversives are never used; indeed, Charlie's current teachers understand how aversives can create more difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's something of a cliché, but there's probably as many ways to teach individuals on the spectrum as there are individuals themselves. Certainly Jim and I are glad to have found a teaching approach that best enables Charlie to learn at this time in his life, and certainly we need to keep our minds open to other approaches, as Charlie grows and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A teaching method is only so good as the person doing the teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculpture is a representation, ranging from &lt;a href="http://www.romaviva.com/Vaticano/michelangelo-pieta.jpg"&gt;extremely lifelike&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://tripinbrooklyn.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/abstract__sculpture.jpg"&gt;extremely abstract&lt;/a&gt;. Like all art, abstract art conveys meaning, sometimes more meaning, because we are pattern seeking creatures. The patterns we see come from our brains, and this tells us something of our experiences and our upbringing. In the abstract example above, I see a mother hawk feeding her chicks.

&lt;p&gt;Most of you probably already know this word, but Pangea has always been one of my favorite geology words. I’m not alone: I’ve heard rumors of a famous geologist who named his daughter Pangea. Her first name. Though perhaps that’s just a rumor that all geology students hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def. &lt;strong&gt;PANGEA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. A supercontinent that existed ~250 million years ago. This supercontinent start breaking up ~200 million years ago into the individual continents that comprise today’s configuration of the crust.&lt;br&gt;
2. An inappropriate yet charming name for geologists to name their daughters.&lt;br&gt;
3. An alternative costume idea for superhero parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer I started graduate school, I went to a “P-Party” dressed in my homemade Pangea costume. As the name suggests, for this party you have to dress as something that starts with the letter P. The costumes- pirates, penises, parrots, princesses, etc.- range from cliche to creative and outrageous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend that you consider a “Pangea” costume for next Halloween or your next dress-up party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to make your very own Pangea costume: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Go to Wal-Mart or another discount store. Purchase a cheap blue tracksuit or blue t-shirt + blue pants. Make sure that felt can stick to your outfit. Generally, the cheaper the blue material the better. Also purchase at least seven different colors of felt squares and a length of blue sparkly fabric.&lt;br&gt;
2. Using your xerox machine of choice, blow up a map of the world. Make the continents an appropriate size so that they can all fit on your chest as Pangea.&lt;br&gt;
3. Cut out the continents from your various xerox papers. Trace around these cut-outs onto your felt. Make each continent a different color. Cut out the felt shapes. You now have your continents!&lt;br&gt;
4. Don your ugly blue track suit. Place the felt continents on your chest so that they line up as Pangea.&lt;br&gt;
5. Tie the sparkly blue fabric around your neck. After all, you need a cape since you are a SUPERcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this costume is that it is interactive. The felt continents can stick anywhere on your blue track suit, so you can rearrange them at will. When I wore my Pangea costume to a party, various geologists re-arranged the continents on my chest while arguing about the order of continental break-up. Girls be cautious! Only let cute geologists “re-arrange the continents.” Also beware that the continents tend to “drift” throughout the night… onto different parts of the shirt, onto friends, onto the ground, into your beer, etc. By the end fo the night, I had lost Antarctica. But I figured that’s okay since it’s sort of a lost continent anyway. I also lost India, but that’s just a subcontinent so that’s also okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to develop the habit of posting the geology word of the week every Sunday/Monday so that it comes out about the same time every week. I have several ideas for words, but feel free to let me know any unusual/fun words you may have. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240805321984"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3084">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07cc765e650f6c31</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion and Public Policy"/><category term="Democratic Party"/><category term="GOP"/><category term="Republicans"/><category term="satan"/><category term="Utah"/><title type="html">Utah Republicans against the satanic Democrats</title><published>2009-04-27T04:08:15Z</published><updated>2009-04-27T04:08:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/utah-republicans-against-the-satanic-democrats/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carriehoffman.com/gloryblog/sexydevil.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.carriehoffman.com/gloryblog/sexydevil.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Utah Republicans have finally figured out how the Democrats won the last election. It’s all due to one guy. Who could it be? Who could it be? Could it be…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12228215%22"&gt;SATAN!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Larsen, a Springville delegate, offered the resolution, titled “Resolution opposing the Hate America anti-Christian Open Borders cabal,” warning delegates that an “invisible government” comprised of left-wing foundations was pumping money into the Democratic Party to push for looser immigration laws and anti-family legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larsen said Democrats get most of the votes cast by illegal immigrants and people in dysfunctional families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not the Democrats who are behind this strategy, Larsen said. It’s the devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Satan’s ultimate goal is to destroy the family,” Larsen said, “and these people are playing a leading part in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larsen’s resolution contained quotes from the New Testament on the battle between good and evil. The copy of the resolution handed to delegates stated it “fulfills scriptural prophecies about our times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah GOP did finally reject the resolution but only because apparently they thought it would cost them Latino votes to claim Satan was behind bringing immigrants to America in the first place. But at no point do they criticize the resolution for its actual absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Australia, we have &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/26/meryl-dorey-endorses-homeopathy-for-treatment-of-whooping-cough/"&gt;news of a powerful program on vaccination&lt;/a&gt;. It juxtaposes the story of young Dana McCaffrey, a 4-week-old girl who died of whooping cough, with the anti-vaccination crusader Meryl Dorey, who at one point claims that no one "is going to die from [whooping cough] today", and who says that she treated her own unvaccinated children with homeopathic medicines. Guess which one looks like an uncaring idiot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is less cheering from New Zealand: &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=10568596"&gt;Jim Salinger, a climate scientist, was fired for speaking to the media&lt;/a&gt;.

It's been long overdue. A state of emergency has been declared by the US which you can read about &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_swine_flu_emergency"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. On NBC's Nightly News the word &lt;em&gt;pandemic &lt;/em&gt;was bandied about as a real possibility.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Swine Flu is a punishment sent by God then God's punishments are good, aren't they? We're all sinners so we deserve to drown in our own bodily fluids as our lungs fill up with water, even children, right? People deserve what happens to them because Adam and Eve sinned, or because our parents sinned, or because of original sin (whatever that can possibly mean in this context for children). God's goodness and glory are displayed in the sufferings and deaths of its victims along with the grieving surviving family members. In any case, it's disasters like these that God sends to draw people to him, sort of like beating your wife in order to get her to love you, right? God is perfectly good. Glory be to God! He always does that which is perfectly good. So this is not a tragedy, not a disaster, not an "evil". This is all good! Praise God! Evil is nothing but a privation anyway, according to Augustine. It doesn't really exist!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the Swine Flu can be considered as a perfectly good divine method of population control. Every once-in-a-while God just has to do this because populations get out of hand and because of this they might upset the so-called perfectly fine tuned ecosystem he created. Never mind for a moment that a more humane way to control population is to control our sex drives, or female ovulation cycles, so that we don't even have a population control problem in the first place. And never mind that there is no reason for a miracle working God to be concerned with such a fine tuned ecosystem when he could sustain the world and control population growth by means of several perpetual miracles such that the coming Swine Flu isn't needed at all in his perfectly good plan. No, God knows what he's doing and his ways are the very best. We cannot even fathom how good God's ways are since he's omniscient and knows best. He has perfectly good reasons why he remains hidden. We know this by faith because we certainly cannot figure it out using the rational powers he created in us even given his perfectly good revelation in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, those damned Catholics are not really Christians anyway, so the Swine Flu started in Mexico where it belongs. No wonder they don't have divine protection. We know that our version of Christianity is true because we were born into it. But wait, it's infecting Protestant Evangelical Christian America too? Oh well, forget about the facts. Who needs facts when the high road is to have faith? And any true Christian who dies in this pandemic will go to heaven anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, Jesus told us that when we see such things we should look up into the sky dome of heaven and be thankful, for this is yet another sign that Jesus is coming. Just ignore the many other pandemics that took place, like the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918 and the failed apocalyptic predictions that came with it of the end of the world. In fact, let's hope and pray things get worse because we'd rather be in heaven than here on earth. And ignore also the fact that if the world comes to an immediate end there are still billions of non-Christians who have not yet been reached with the saving knowledge of Jesus, many of whom could still be reached if God grants them more time. Ignore also that these people will burn in hell forever. God's patience cannot last forever. Who cares if he calls a halt to this world whenever he does? I don't. I only care about me. I want to go to be with God soon, today if possible. The people who wind up in hell deserve what they get, even those who die in this coming Swine Flu pandemic. Let them burn. I'm just thankful that in God's graciousness toward me he didn't end the world before I got saved. Isn't God so full of it [grace]? It's simply amazing!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let's thank God and do nothing to prohibit the Swine Flu from spreading because it's God's will. And let's look to the sky for Jesus and help raise money for doomsday ministries that tell the world of the coming disaster upon the heathen, atheists, homosexuals, criminals and child molesters for whom this disaster is being sent. We'll be raptured out of this mess, and even if not, his grace is sufficient for us. We know where we'll go when the time comes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be thankful and praise God in all things!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7149979263919047804?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Thank you to everyone who commented about Charlie's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;very successful hearing test&lt;/a&gt;---everyone in our household has been feeling a nice glow in the wake of it.  Thinking it over, in addition to Charlie's handling the testing and the being in the tiny booth and the new requests so well, what made a huge difference was the audiologist. She spoke to Charlie directly and straightforwardly and kept her requests clear and to the point; she told Charlie what was going to happen and praised him warmly, but not overbearingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie did well at the hearing test by drawing on what he's learned in the past ten years. The understanding of the audiologist also helped a tremendous lot. I wrote earlier today about more training about autism for police departments and others in the community; this audiologist (who would have, of course, been much more likely to come into regular contact with children on the autism spectrum) had clearly had a good share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, too, had Antonio the barber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a couple of years ago that Jim took Charlie to the local barber shop in the town we used to live in and sat him down in a chair and, thanks to the straightforward attitude of the youngest barber in the shop, Michael, taught Charlie to sit for a buzzcut. Michael, as Jim noted to me, just "treated Charlie like any other kid," telling Charlie to put his head up or down and not to move, and I think this "yeah no big deal" stance helped Charlie learn, yeah, it's no big deal to get a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie gets his buzz about every 3-5 weeks (he doesn't like getting soapy shampoo water in his eyes when I wash his hair when it grows out). Michael has moved on to becoming a fireman the next two towns over, but Vincent (who owns the shop) and Antonio have been glad to have Charlie sit in their chairs: No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the midst of a long bike ride during which they ran a couple of errands on a hot spring Jersey day, Jim and Charlie parked their bikes behind the barber shop. Charlie was ushered into Antonio's chair and Jim was waved off----as in, Jim went to the bank, Jim got sodas, Jim sat down and read the paper while Antonio buzz-cut Charlie's hair. Antonio used to work as a custodian at the local middle school and a photo collage of his many grandchildren is on display beside the mirror; as Jim noted, "he's really good with kids." Antonio certainly was steady and easy holding the clipper to Charlie's head and directing him to sit still and then check out his handsomeness in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding; a willingness to try; an ability to communicate a "you can do it" message: These go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And add up to one nice haircut.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240787345970"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/how_to_distort_atheist_goals.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09e788687fb85b8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">How to distort atheist goals</title><published>2009-04-26T23:31:18Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T23:31:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XBNHeym79bo/how_to_distort_atheist_goals.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/how_to_distort_atheist_goals.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Telegraph has a lovely &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/5219687/Atheists-target-UK-schools.html"&gt;article on how The National Federation of Atheist, Humanist and Secular Student Societies is going to brainwash children&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the kind of mud they're slinging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: &lt;span&gt;"Atheists are becoming increasingly militant in their desperate attempts to stamp out faith. It is deeply worrying that they now want to use children to attack the Christian ethos of their schools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Many parents will also be anxious at the thought of militant atheists targeting their children."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, lordy, lordy. "Attack the Christian ethos"? He says that like it would be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't trust the Telegraph, which is openly lying about the program planned. &lt;a href="http://atheistblogger.com/2009/04/26/telegraph-caught-lying-for-jesus/"&gt;Go straight to the source&lt;/a&gt; to find out what they're actually up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the AHS &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; wants to do is encourage interfaith discussion through a variety of events, focusing on both scientific and religious education, as well as supporting charity work. The aims of the current initiative are outlined in brief &lt;a href="http://www.ahsstudents.org.uk/press/releases/3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To teach students how to debate and create dialogue between school faith groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide the school with fun and educational events and activities, including two student-led courses: &amp;#39;Perspectives&amp;#39; in which a speaker from a faith group gives a talk followed by Q&amp;amp;A, and our &amp;#39;One Life&amp;#39; course, which considers moral and ethical issues without god. Many events will also support the scientific curriculum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage charity volunteering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give students the experience of running a group and managing events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show students that it's ok not to believe in god and encourage critical thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring out issues concerning religious privilege in schools such as collective worship and incomplete or biased religious education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those things, of course, are horribly objectionable to certain Christians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/how_to_distort_atheist_goals.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XBNHeym79bo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240785982537"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/ask_a_silly_question.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8b726e83c4976c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Passing thoughts"/><title type="html">Ask a silly question ...</title><published>2009-04-26T21:53:32Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T21:53:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/vdzkciwLE8o/ask_a_silly_question.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/ask_a_silly_question.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, Spring!

&lt;p&gt;Aren't you looking forward to seeing a tortured corpse adorning cars in your neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hideous plate is one of the options &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/article995257.ece"&gt;railroaded through the Florida legislature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious specialty plates offered by Sen. Ronda Storms, R-Valrico, and Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, made it onto a bill Friday even though many members had not seen images of those plates and none was produced for the debate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Siplin didn't mince words when asked what his "Trinity" plate looks like, saying, "It has a picture of my Lord and savior Jesus Christ." It, along with a "Preserving the Past" plate offered by Siplin, would benefit the Toomey Foundation for the Natural Sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Storms' "I Believe" plate would benefit Faith in Teaching, an Orlando company that funds faith-based programs at schools. Its design features a cross over a stained-glass window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just the hideous design and offensive obeisance to religion by the state…it&amp;#39;s that the money from these idols will be siphoned off to dubious organizations. &amp;quot;Faith in Teaching&amp;quot; is obviously non-secular; the &lt;a href="http://toomeyfoundation.com/index.html"&gt;Toomey Foundation&lt;/a&gt; might be a bit better, but I'm immediately suspicious of purported science organizations that plaster bible verses on all of their web pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/making_florida_highways_that_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/GC4D9WH-i4Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240778699067"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/support_cuts_and_systems_perspectives">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f57748abb9a1a03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Support Cuts and Systems Perspectives</title><published>2009-04-26T20:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T20:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/support_cuts_and_systems_perspectives" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogbomb/526961087/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1227/526961087_3923a945ac_m.jpg" alt="close up of a tangle of many different kinds and colors of wires" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At a time when the creation of jobs in the U.S. is a top priority, and indeed the goal of the economic stimulus, it seems the last thing that needs doing is to explicitly reduce jobs.  And yet, that seems to be just what is happening &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/04/cuts-to-disability-employment-programs.html"&gt;in Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move that one director of an agency which provides a day employment program calls "penny wise and pound foolish," Massachusetts has proposed a $7.4 million cut to funding for day employment programs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now regardless of whether "day employment programs" are a good solution, at least they may be a solution for some.  And expanding out, there have also been severe cuts to vocational rehabilitation and other employment related services, as we all know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What interests me most about the Massachusetts article is the notion of "penny wise and pound foolish," as well as some analysis that starts looking outside the immediate panic response to how a change in one place--cuts to day programs--affects change in another place--the use of crisis services, impact to family, a person's ability to live in the community and resulting expensive other types of placement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field I study, and my main Interest since earliest memory, is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system"&gt;complex systems&lt;/a&gt; field.  Quoting wikipedia's definition here which is pretty good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complex system is a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit one or more properties (behavior among the possible properties) not obvious from the properties of the individual parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system is a set of parts which relate to each other in some way that can be considered a whole relative to some environment (i.e. that which is not within the system).  Social systems, like those involved in economies, or, smaller, employment, or, smaller still, employment for people with disabilities, are complex.  They are comprised of interconnected parts that exhibit a behavior that isn't always obvious from examining individual bits (like funding to a particular program) in isolation.  So a lot of care needs to be taken to understand the parts, the whole, and the relationships before making changes that could impact the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I give presentations on systems thinking, I often joke that systems thinking will someday save the world--but it's only half a joke really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As policy makers look for where to make needed cuts, it's critical that they think about everything that connects to what is being cut, what the relationships are, and question whether there will be something like a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_effect"&gt;cascade effect&lt;/a&gt; that creates even more problems than the cut was intended to solve.  Short sighted, instant gratification, fixation on isolated parts, and lack of understanding the systems perspective might even be how we got into this economic predicament in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important that the people who make decisions that have effects us fully understand exactly what those effects might be--long term, big picture, and in relationship to our families, communities, state, nation, and the world--before they implement the decision.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240778501513"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1503463982088624837">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e985acd043eacc38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Educated People Can Disagree Agreeably and Learn From One Another</title><published>2009-04-27T03:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-29T12:29:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/P5e1tSkNndE/only-educated-people-can-disagree.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1503463982088624837/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1503463982088624837" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/only-educated-people-can-disagree.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">I received yet another email from a Christian professor who is planning on using my book in his classes. Here is what he said about my recent decision not to allow any more comments [Edit by popular demand we're now moderating comments]:&lt;span&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I have really appreciated reading your DC blog the past couple of months after very carefully reading, highlighting, and writing in the margins of &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/a&gt;. (I agree with your suggestion that it merits a second and third reading.) I was disappointed when I read about your decision to no longer allow general comments. I understand that you must get frustrated by the many banal comments of those who just want to argue rather than discuss intelligently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am planning to use your book in a couple of courses I teach, one undergrad and one grad class, and was hoping to use the blog as a way for my students to interact with you and others in the blogosphere. I would enjoy finding a venue by which that could still happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I figured you were getting some annoying and hateful posts. My concern is that there are so few places anywhere, including cyberspace, for genuine, thoughtful conversation between open-minded people on both sides of the theism fence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is what I have wanted my Blog to be from the beginning despite the attention getting name (once again, it's main purpose is to grab people's attention), although I don't claim to be open to Christianity at this point even if I AM willing to have an open dialog about it (which may be what he meant). But there are ignorant Christian trolls who comment here to try to disrupt and derail this discussion/debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what's the difference? Why is it that educated Christians and professors want to truly engage our arguments in a thoughtful and mostly mutual respectful manner but that ignorant Christians do not?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I have an answer. Only ignorant people (on both sides, by the way) think that whoever disagrees with them is stupid, ignorant and dumb. We can see this almost everywhere. An ignorant person not accustomed to fine wine, classical music, art, or the classic novels of the day simply cannot appreciate them. They have to be educated to see why such things are indeed on a higher level than cheap wine, rap music, graffiti or romance novels. What we fail to understand we also think is unworthy or undignified and that people who enjoy them are stupid, ignorant or dumb. But educated people know differently, even if on some levels they can still appreciate other expressions of these kinds of things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Full disclosure, I like cheap wine. I like some rap music and I don't listen to classical music much. I also think some graffiti is amazing, even if it's illegal. I dislike novels, even classical ones for the most part, especially romance novels (from what I understand romance novels are a woman's kind of pornography anyway). But then I am not claiming to be knowledgeable about these kinds of things. I lack the refinement of these tastes, but then I know that I do and I will never tell people with these more refined educated tastes they are ignorant or stupid for having them. I just don't think there is any comparison with the music of a Beethoven, Back, Chopin or Brahms with Vanilla Ice and some others, although many rappers are really creative. For instance, have you heard &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_089EURkNo"&gt;Wanna be a Baller&lt;/a&gt; by Lil' Troy? ;-)]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first few months after becoming a Christian I was dispensationalist. I remember reading through my Scofield Bible Study Bible notes as if these notes were as authoritative as the Bible text itself. I didn’t know any better. No alternative view was presented to me. So when I ran across a Christian who questioned this eschatology I had a hard time thinking that other person believed the Bible! I was ignorant. I later learned that Christian people had such disagreements. In fact, on issue after issue where I found disagreement among other Christians the more and more I learned that Christians can believe a wide variety of things and still believe the Bible. But this process took some time. As I became better educated I could embrace more and more Christians as Bible believers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same thing went for many different kinds of arguments I found at first thought ot be repelling, especially as I began studying philosophy. If you have ever thought that someone was completely ignorant to think there is no material world then just wait until you get into a Ph.D. program and take seriously George Berkeley’s arguments on behalf of Idealism. Then you will no longer think such an argument is stupid or absurd, even if you might still find it wrongheaded, if you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the point. As one becomes educated, truly educated, then the absurd doesn’t sound absurd anymore. You'll probably still think certain ideas are wrong, of course, but you cannot say of most any idea defended by an educated scholarly person that it is so completely out of whack that anyone who believes and defends it is just stupid, ignorant, or dumb. In fact, since none of us has a corner on the truth (and there is disagreement among philosophers about what truth is) then even those ideas we thought of initially as absurd might be correct after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the ignorant think that people who disagree are ignorant simply by virtue of the fact that they disagree. People who are educated will use the opportunity of interaction mainly as a time to learn from one another and then to disagree agreeably. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s something else. An educated person knows when someone else is educated. S/he can see it in how the argument is expressed, how much force is claimed for the argument, whether the person pontificates about things for which it isn’t possible to pontificate on, and so forth. For instance, when someone starts out an essay or comment claiming to "refute" a certain philosophical argument, that is a very large claim to make and is unlikely to happen (within certain restrictions, or course). Educated people know that the larger the claim is then the harder that claim is to defend. Educated people look for these kinds of things and they can tell when the person they are discussing something with is educated or not. The ignorant haven’t a clue. All they see is disagreement, and where they find it they automatically present their opponents a screwball award because they cannot recognize these clues. And they most emphatically cannot understand that the other person simply cannot say all that s/he knows in one short comment, one short posting, one short summary of an argument, or even one book. We all know more than we can say, although some people are better at saying it than others. So we must always assume the other person has more to say on a topic, and not assume that this is all he can say about it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ignorant person may also suggest some silly stupid objection to what a person writes as if this objection will end the debate. The ignorant person may even think such an objection has not even been considered before. The educated person offers better objections and asks whether it has been considered before. And an educated person will usually just ask of another recognized educated person what his response is to the objection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes the best thing is for an educated person, who is on your side of the issue, to tell the ignorant people on his side, that this is what he sees when he reads the arguments of the person on the other side of the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Educated Christians are saying that they appreciate our type of atheism here at DC, for the most part. And professors in both Christian and secular colleges are using my book in their classes on apologetics and atheism. This should be a clue to the ignorant Christians out there that educated Christians take me and this Blog seriously, that we know what we're talking about, and that we are worthy opponents, despite the fact that they still disagree. That's because educated people can disagree agreeably and learn from one another, although even educated people falter from time to time in the heat of a debate, which does happen, because we still disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish the ignorant Christians who comment here would understand this, but then to do so they must become educated. I can only hope that barring a good education they will listen to the educated Christians and engage us in respectful debates about theses issues, instead of name calling, slander and charges of stupidity, ignorance and of being dumb. This only reveals THEIR ignorance, for they are saying something different than their own professors in Christian colleges are saying when they choose my book as a textbook for their classes on atheism and apologetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q.E.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1503463982088624837?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

All went extremely well, and I was able to ask a few (I hope useful) questions, and also witness the way in which the people closer to the subject matter - the experimentalists - questioned their candidate. One thing I took away from this experience was a renewed admiration for the extremely hands-on way in which experimentalists, particularly those working in a subject that continually challenges one’s intuition, understand the concepts and quantities they deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a specific example, one question concerned how far various particles traveled from a primary interaction vertex in a detector. Obviously, a correct answer to this question requires the knowledge of an awful lot of physics. However, there are rough estimates one can do knowing a few simple facts such as the speed of light. Of course, we all know the speed of light, which we denote as c. Most of us physicists first learned that c is about 3 times 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; meters per second. If you are in my field you are more likely to use different units; namely those in which c=1. However, neither of these choices of unit is particularly suited to calculating something useful for a collider experiment or, indeed, to making an on the fly estimate of a human-sized quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimentalists in the room all use, of course, standard sets of units familiar to us all. However, they keep in their heads a bunch of handy human-sized versions, that just aren’t part of my (and I suspect many theorists’) usual way of thinking. In the case above, the relevant example is that light travels one foot per nanosecond (not metric, I know, but one meter per 3.3 nanoseconds somehow doesn’t have the same ring to it). I know the conversion takes hardly any time, and I know this isn’t a particularly scientifically deep piece of knowledge, but I think having a human-scale idea of uncommonly large physical numbers provides a very nice feel for the concept that just isn’t captured by the ways in which we normally, abstractly, think of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m interested to know what other common sense statements of uncommonly large or small physical quantities our wise and worldly readers might have at their fingertips. Feel free to chime in in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

But in fact these arguments and make-believe situations are irrelevent if torture doesn't work in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of my new weekly posts on evidence-based policy for the UK politics blog &lt;a href="http://www.liberalconspiracy.org"&gt;Liberal Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, I want to explore the evidence for torture, because if those who advocate it can't prove that it works, then they have already lost the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it's also a limited organization, and this &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/generals-who-do.html"&gt;post by Richard Hoppe at the Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt; exposes their flaws. It's blind. It's locked in to one strategy. It's response to people who try to branch out in new directions is to discourage them, often in a rather patronizing way. This is not a good approach to take when we've been deadlocked for years and they offer &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; prospects for future victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been making the argument for some time that the NCSE is our defensive line, and they are great at that...we don't want to lose them. In fact, they are so good that we haven't lost a creationist court case since Scopes, in recent years thanks to the invaluable assistance of the staff at NCSE, and we've built up such a body of legal precedent that we can feel fairly secure that they creationists are going to consistently get their butts kicked in the courts (it also helps that the &lt;a href="http://evaluatingchristianity.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/you-dont-trust-creationists-with-your-science-education-heres-why-you-shouldnt-trust-their-lawyers-either/"&gt;creationists are incompetent at both science and the law&lt;/a&gt;). With that success, however, comes complacency and overconfidence and a belief that their approach is is the One True Way…and now, a gradual drift into identifying more with the opposition than with a significant percentage of their own team and their own fans. They also seem determined to ignore reality — we live in a country that is split in the middle on the topic of evolution, and the creationists are not in decline. Victories in the courtroom are not the same as victories in the minds of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s our big problem: we have had no offense at all, and we&amp;#39;re never going to make any progress without one. Keeping the other team from scoring is important but doesn&amp;#39;t win us any games if we can never carry our arguments forward — we&amp;#39;re always being told to stop at the point where we are drawing the logical implications of science and evolution and told to back off…it might &lt;i&gt;alienate&lt;/i&gt; the other team. Worse, our defense is then rushing to help the apologetics of the opposition. This is all done in the name of what they call political pragmatism. Always, they say, they have to mollify the religious people on school boards, in government, and the electorate if they want to get anything accomplished; they can't &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; state outright that evolution refutes most religious views of creation, that science reveals a universe dominated by chance and necessity and natural processes, because, well, they'll throw science out then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How patronizing. How condescending. If true, this means that our so-called allies in this fight are actually not — they don&amp;#39;t ultimately want to support science as it actually is, but are instead fishing for scientists willing to use their authority to support the continued dominance of religious thought. And &lt;i&gt;our defenders are happy to give it to them&lt;/i&gt;. Is it any wonder that we are making no progress in changing American culture? The ruling ideology would like nothing better than to perpetuate the stalemate, and the leadership of the opposing minority willingly cedes them all kinds of ground in order to maintain what little we've got, and never takes a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we succeeding if the only way we can promote our ideas is by hiding the implications of those ideas, and pretending that the antithesis of scientific thought is fully compatible with science? &lt;b&gt;Collaborating with our opponents is not the same as making allies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when real allies in the cause of science do show up and try to make a difference, we are misrepresented in order to discredit us. This doesn't help, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a 3-Sunday series of talks on religion, evolution, and morality in a local Protestant church recently. Had I walked in there and opened with "OK, folks, in order to understand and accept evolution as I'll present it today, you have to deconvert" I'd have lost my (overflow) audience in the first five minutes. That would have robbed me of the opportunity to introduce religious people to the power and breadth of the theory and to describe the misconceptions that the fundamentalist Christians have been feeding children and adults in my community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to remember that line. I've never started a talk that way myself, even though I have also spoken in churches. Funny thing is, in those situations (as well as in the classroom) I just focus on telling the story of the evidence. That is our strength, right? I don't have to announce that the Book of Genesis is wrong and silly, but I also don't have to go out of my way to tell them some pretty excuse to allow them to continue to believe in talking snakes. And if I'm asked, I tell them straightforwardly that literal religious accounts are falsified by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also told them that one factor in my loss of faith was the promulgation of bad interpretations of the Bible that contradicted the evidence of science, and that they were going to drive more intelligent people out of their congregations if they insisted on adherence to falsified ideas. That often seems a more effective and &lt;i&gt;pragmatic&lt;/i&gt; approach than pretending they can believe whatever they want and still remain true to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also amused by the asymmetry of these situations. Francis Collins and Ken Miller can build reputations as public speakers on pronouncements of their faith, yet somehow the atheists in their audiences don't go running for the doors when they mention god. Are we to assume that Richard Hoppe's audiences are all weak and stupid, and incapable of coping with anything less than an affirmation of their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a little more confidence in them. I wouldn&amp;#39;t start with the ridiculous line he suggested (it&amp;#39;s false, for one thing), but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be at all reluctant to say that science contradicts many interpretations of the audience&amp;#39;s religion, and that if anyone needs to do any accommodation to reality, it&amp;#39;s not us, it&amp;#39;s them. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would flee; I might get more argument in the Q&amp;amp;A, though, which would be a fine and enlightening thing. I also don&amp;#39;t think that honesty about our differences necessarily makes enemies. I also think that ultimately, it is far more — and here&amp;#39;s a word you&amp;#39;ll rarely hear from me in regards to the foes of science — &lt;i&gt;respectful&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of respectful, there's another tactic that the allies of the NCSE have often used against the outspoken atheists in their midst, and it is one guaranteed to piss me off. It is the condescending attitude that they alone are actually doing any work; that the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; people are the True Americans of the heartland who don't have the fancy-schmancy educations and get their hands dirty in the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of the foot soldiers in this battle, a sergeant operating in a conservative rural county far from the ethereal heights of the University of Chicago. I&amp;#39;ve been at it (off and on, mostly on for the last 6 years) for more than 20 years. I published my first article on the political nature of the evolution/religion conflict in 1987. I am engaged at the local and state levels, the former on a weekly basis (search this blog on &amp;quot;Freshwater&amp;quot; for local stuff and see here for just one example of State BOE stuff). My political experience goes back to 1968, when I was a big city Democratic party ward officer. I have a hell of a lot better view of what&amp;#39;s pragmatically necessary and what is effective at the level of the local school board and the local church than Coyne can even imagine. Coyne (and Myers and Moran and Dawkins) are not engaged at that level on anything approaching a regular basis. They lead their congregations from high pulpits. They sit above the choir preaching a message that is disconnected from — indeed, sometimes antithetical to — the reality on the ground. They&amp;#39;re the generals who argued against air power, courtmartialed Billy Mitchell, and then watched ships sink at Pearl Harbor. Coyne wants to argue philosophy in a political war. That&amp;#39;s not a tactic, it&amp;#39;s a politically lethal red herring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew. I'm lucky that he didn't rail against the ethereal heights of Morris, Minnesota, and chose instead to sneer at a great university in a mere working class midwestern city. I might have felt picked upon. I'm also glad he chose not to hurl his contempt using that frequently vilified term, the "elites", or I might have mistaken the Panda's Thumb for World Net Daily for a moment. Isn't it such an American thing, to treat all but the lowest, most local level of action as a liability? To scowl at intellectual expertise as if it were a scarlet letter marking the bearer as worthy of ostracism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another failure of the NCSE. Rather than taking advantage of those voices like Dawkins and Coyne, they neglect them as dangerous and corrupting to their One True Message of the compatibility of science and religion. It&amp;#39;s a shame, too. I have nothing against Richard Hoppe and would agree that his work on the ground is invaluable, but he will not get the audiences and the media attention or spark the discussion and thinking of those &amp;quot;high pulpit&amp;quot; luminaries — and I doubt that he even gets the crowds of the lesser glimmering of a PZ Myers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I got the same attitude from Ken Miller in a podcast we did together. At one point he accused me of doing nothing to help science education, and bragged that he was busy criss-crossing Kansas doing talks while I was sitting at my little blog (and also teaching college biology courses, although he didn't mention that). It was remarkably condescending, and it also ignored the facts: people like Hoppe and Miller and the staff at NCSE have also been busily promoting the idea that atheists like me or Dawkins or Coyne are anathema in the public discourse, since we don't preach the message of compatibility. I was not giving lectures in Kansas &lt;i&gt;because I was not asked&lt;/i&gt;. It was not because I somehow think I am above the fray, or do not value public education as much as Ken Miller; I would enthusiastically take on the foot-soldier role if voices of my kind were not squeezed out of the forum by our own allies. This is why some of us are beginning to express our resentment of the approach taken by the NCSE and its friends: they have chosen as their preferred face of science spokespeople who are not representative of the majority of scientists, and who are definitely not at all representative of the significant fraction of even more militant atheists among us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of our message is also being ignored and misrepresented, all, apparently, as part of a campaign to make sure atheist voices are kept out of the much-valued "foot soldier" role. As &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/big-dustup-at-pandas-thumb/"&gt;Jerry Coyne has repeatedly said&lt;/a&gt;, our grievance is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that the NCSE is an insufficiently atheistic organization. We are most definitely not arguing that pro-evolution, pro-science promoters &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be atheists — we are not urging a reversal of the current situation with a boycott of religious speakers, and we do not want NCSE&amp;#39;s help promoting atheism (we are doing a phenomenal job of that already, I can say smugly). We are asking that this  pretense that religion and science are compatible, and that the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way to get political support is for the majority of scientists to sit back and shut up about their rational views while the scientists who endorse superstition are propped up as our façade, has got to end. If the national science organizations want to be pragmatic, then &lt;i&gt;stop speaking only favorably of religion&lt;/i&gt;. Stop bringing religion up altogether, and stick to the science. Or let godless voices join the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Hoppe's complaint did make me laugh aloud at one point, with his analogy to the atheists being the generals who tried to stop air power. He got it backwards. He's representing a view that wants to keep doing the same thing over and over again, fighting the last court case endlessly, disdaining those radicals who want to shake things up with innovative approaches. I'm sorry, Richard, but the &lt;b&gt;atheists are your air force&lt;/b&gt;. We&amp;#39;re going forward with a bold new offense against the regressive forces that have kept this country locked in a stalemate — we are going to change the culture with an aggressive promotion of rational ideas and our ongoing opposition to religious superstition. We like your slow old boats and your foot soldiers, and think they have an effective, even essential, role to play, too — but we&amp;#39;re going to fly with your support or without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get used to it. Of course, we'd be even more effective if we coordinated, rather than that you constantly refused to take advantage of our potential.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/foot_soldiers_who_lack_vision.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-09Xt9vJ5Gk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240771615249"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4244">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08d175c269fdea53</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Foot soldiers who lack vision</title><published>2009-04-26T18:48:17Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T18:48:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/foot-soldiers-w.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The NCSE is an excellent organization, and I've frequently urged people at my talks to join it. However, it's also a limited organization, and this &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/generals-who-do.html"&gt;post by Richard Hoppe at the Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt; exposes their flaws. It's blind. It's locked in to one strategy. It's response to people who try to branch out in new directions is to discourage them, often in a rather patronizing way. This is not a good approach to take when we've been deadlocked for years and they offer &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; prospects for future victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been making the argument for some time that the NCSE is our defensive line, and they are great at that...we don't want to lose them. In fact, they are so good that we haven't lost a creationist court case since Scopes, in recent years thanks to the invaluable assistance of the staff at NCSE, and we've built up such a body of legal precedent that we can feel fairly secure that they creationists are going to consistently get their butts kicked in the courts (it also helps that the &lt;a href="http://evaluatingchristianity.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/you-dont-trust-creationists-with-your-science-education-heres-why-you-shouldnt-trust-their-lawyers-either/"&gt;creationists are incompetent at both science and the law&lt;/a&gt;). With that success, however, comes complacency and overconfidence and a belief that their approach is is the One True Way…and now, a gradual drift into identifying more with the opposition than with a significant percentage of their own team and their own fans. They also seem determined to ignore reality — we live in a country that is split in the middle on the topic of evolution, and the creationists are not in decline. Victories in the courtroom are not the same as victories in the minds of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
        

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s our big problem: we have had no offense at all, and we&amp;#39;re never going to make any progress without one. Keeping the other team from scoring is important but doesn&amp;#39;t win us any games if we can never carry our arguments forward — we&amp;#39;re always being told to stop at the point where we are drawing the logical implications of science and evolution and told to back off…it might &lt;i&gt;alienate&lt;/i&gt; the other team. Worse, our defense is then rushing to help the apologetics of the opposition. This is all done in the name of what they call political pragmatism. Always, they say, they have to mollify the religious people on school boards, in government, and the electorate if they want to get anything accomplished; they can't &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; state outright that evolution refutes most religious views of creation, that science reveals a universe dominated by chance and necessity and natural processes, because, well, they'll throw science out then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How patronizing. How condescending. If true, this means that our so-called allies in this fight are actually not — they don&amp;#39;t ultimately want to support science as it actually is, but are instead fishing for scientists willing to use their authority to support the continued dominance of religious thought. And &lt;i&gt;our defenders are happy to give it to them&lt;/i&gt;. Is it any wonder that we are making no progress in changing American culture? The ruling ideology would like nothing better than to perpetuate the stalemate, and the leadership of the opposing minority willingly cedes them all kinds of ground in order to maintain what little we've got, and never takes a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we succeeding if the only way we can promote our ideas is by hiding the implications of those ideas, and pretending that the antithesis of scientific thought is fully compatible with science? &lt;b&gt;Collaborating with our opponents is not the same as making allies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when real allies in the cause of science do show up and try to make a difference, we are misrepresented in order to discredit us. This doesn't help, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a 3-Sunday series of talks on religion, evolution, and morality in a local Protestant church recently. Had I walked in there and opened with "OK, folks, in order to understand and accept evolution as I'll present it today, you have to deconvert" I'd have lost my (overflow) audience in the first five minutes. That would have robbed me of the opportunity to introduce religious people to the power and breadth of the theory and to describe the misconceptions that the fundamentalist Christians have been feeding children and adults in my community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to remember that line. I've never started a talk that way myself, even though I have also spoken in churches. Funny thing is, in those situations (as well as in the classroom) I just focus on telling the story of the evidence. That is our strength, right? I don't have to announce that the Book of Genesis is wrong and silly, but I also don't have to go out of my way to tell them some pretty excuse to allow them to continue to believe in talking snakes. And if I'm asked, I tell them straightforwardly that literal religious accounts are falsified by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also told them that one factor in my loss of faith was the promulgation of bad interpretations of the Bible that contradicted the evidence of science, and that they were going to drive more intelligent people out of their congregations if they insisted on adherence to falsified ideas. That often seems a more effective and &lt;i&gt;pragmatic&lt;/i&gt; approach than pretending they can believe whatever they want and still remain true to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also amused by the asymmetry of these situations. Francis Collins and Ken Miller can build reputations as public speakers on pronouncements of their faith, yet somehow the atheists in their audiences don't go running for the doors when they mention god. Are we to assume that Richard Hoppe's audiences are all weak and stupid, and incapable of coping with anything less than an affirmation of their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a little more confidence in them. I wouldn&amp;#39;t start with the ridiculous line he suggested (it&amp;#39;s false, for one thing), but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be at all reluctant to say that science contradicts many interpretations of the audience&amp;#39;s religion, and that if anyone needs to do any accommodation to reality, it&amp;#39;s not us, it&amp;#39;s them. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would flee; I might get more argument in the Q&amp;amp;A, though, which would be a fine and enlightening thing. I also don&amp;#39;t think that honesty about our differences necessarily makes enemies. I also think that ultimately, it is far more — and here&amp;#39;s a word you&amp;#39;ll rarely hear from me in regards to the foes of science — &lt;i&gt;respectful&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of respectful, there's another tactic that the allies of the NCSE have often used against the outspoken atheists in their midst, and it is one guaranteed to piss me off. It is the condescending attitude that they alone are actually doing any work; that the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; people are the True Americans of the heartland who don't have the fancy-schmancy educations and get their hands dirty in the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of the foot soldiers in this battle, a sergeant operating in a conservative rural county far from the ethereal heights of the University of Chicago. I&amp;#39;ve been at it (off and on, mostly on for the last 6 years) for more than 20 years. I published my first article on the political nature of the evolution/religion conflict in 1987. I am engaged at the local and state levels, the former on a weekly basis (search this blog on &amp;quot;Freshwater&amp;quot; for local stuff and see here for just one example of State BOE stuff). My political experience goes back to 1968, when I was a big city Democratic party ward officer. I have a hell of a lot better view of what&amp;#39;s pragmatically necessary and what is effective at the level of the local school board and the local church than Coyne can even imagine. Coyne (and Myers and Moran and Dawkins) are not engaged at that level on anything approaching a regular basis. They lead their congregations from high pulpits. They sit above the choir preaching a message that is disconnected from — indeed, sometimes antithetical to — the reality on the ground. They&amp;#39;re the generals who argued against air power, courtmartialed Billy Mitchell, and then watched ships sink at Pearl Harbor. Coyne wants to argue philosophy in a political war. That&amp;#39;s not a tactic, it&amp;#39;s a politically lethal red herring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew. I'm lucky that he didn't rail against the ethereal heights of Morris, Minnesota, and chose instead to sneer at a great university in a mere working class midwestern city. I might have felt picked upon. I'm also glad he chose not to hurl his contempt using that frequently vilified term, the "elites", or I might have mistaken the Panda's Thumb for World Net Daily for a moment. Isn't it such an American thing, to treat all but the lowest, most local level of action as a liability? To scowl at intellectual expertise as if it were a scarlet letter marking the bearer as worthy of ostracism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another failure of the NCSE. Rather than taking advantage of those voices like Dawkins and Coyne, they neglect them as dangerous and corrupting to their One True Message of the compatibility of science and religion. It&amp;#39;s a shame, too. I have nothing against Richard Hoppe and would agree that his work on the ground is invaluable, but he will not get the audiences and the media attention or spark the discussion and thinking of those &amp;quot;high pulpit&amp;quot; luminaries — and I doubt that he even gets the crowds of the lesser glimmering of a PZ Myers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I got the same attitude from Ken Miller in a podcast we did together. At one point he accused me of doing nothing to help science education, and bragged that he was busy criss-crossing Kansas doing talks while I was sitting at my little blog (and also teaching college biology courses, although he didn't mention that). It was remarkably condescending, and it also ignored the facts: people like Hoppe and Miller and the staff at NCSE have also been busily promoting the idea that atheists like me or Dawkins or Coyne are anathema in the public discourse, since we don't preach the message of compatibility. I was not giving lectures in Kansas &lt;i&gt;because I was not asked&lt;/i&gt;. It was not because I somehow think I am above the fray, or do not value public education as much as Ken Miller; I would enthusiastically take on the foot-soldier role if voices of my kind were not squeezed out of the forum by our own allies. This is why some of us are beginning to express our resentment of the approach taken by the NCSE and its friends: they have chosen as their preferred face of science spokespeople who are not representative of the majority of scientists, and who are definitely not at all representative of the significant fraction of even more militant atheists among us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/011143.html#011143"&gt;The box looked interesting:&lt;/a&gt; “Accidents, natural disasters, police operations, your decisions can mean life or death for those involved!” Hey, I’m there for that. “New: Real-time physics: falling debris, crashing buildings.” Price was right — I picked it up.

&lt;p&gt;
There are twenty missions on the game disk for the campaign game. All but one start with a short (approx. 30 sec.) movie showing how you got into that situation to start with. (In the video clip I just linked to, the train consists of boxcars filled with fireworks and tank cars filled with liquid oxygen.) During game play, you’ll be interrupted from time to time by more cut scenes as the world turns progressively to dung in front of your eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This game was originally produced by a German company, which explains the German uniforms worn by the firefighters, the European-style sirens, the German scenery, and the bizarre abbreviations for the vehicle types. DLK, for example, stands for Drehleiter (mit Korb), and is a ladder truck. RTW stands for Rettungstransportwagen, and is an ambulance. RW is Rüstwagen, an equipment truck (which you’re going to need if you want your Jaws of Life or chainsaw). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these folks are just parents, people concerned about their kids, people desperately looking for a cause for a devastating illness. Others are vocal advocates of nonsense, saying things that are proven beyond reasonable doubt to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result? Kids, including infants, are getting sick, and some of them are dying. Never, &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; forget that, no matter how loudly these people yell, and no matter what garbage they spout (including, inevitably, in the comments that will follow this very post). &lt;em&gt;Babies are dying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia,&lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-anti-vacc-movement-an-australian-perspective/"&gt; this movement is taking root as well&lt;/a&gt;. Calling the alarm to this, a TV program in Oz called &amp;quot;Sunday Night&amp;quot; aired an excellent exposé of what happens when parents don’t vaccinate their kids: they risk their children’s lives, and those of others. In the case shown on the TV show, a four-week-old baby, Dana McCaffery, died of whooping cough. This innocent infant wasn’t eligible for vaccination yet, but the lack of herd immunity — that region has lower-than-average vaccination rates — sealed her fate. The fact that other parents didn’t vaccinate their kids gave that little girl a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-63XHXxTM4"&gt;Here’s the segment from that program&lt;/a&gt;. Warning (and I’m serious): if you are a parent, or any kind of feeling human being, this segment is seriously disturbing. I could barely watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maggie at &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/04/26/meryl-dorey-endorses-homeopathy-for-treatment-of-whooping-cough/"&gt;Sceptic’s Book&lt;/a&gt; has written quite a moving article about this report and the result. The reporter in this TV program, &lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/presenter-profiles/-/4336456"&gt;Rebecca Maddern&lt;/a&gt;, did a pretty good job, though giving way too much time and credence to antivax mouthpiece &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/quackery/meryldorey.htm"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, who spouts the usual antivax mendacities about vaccination, including bragging — &lt;em&gt;bragging&lt;/em&gt; — that she was exposed to diseases when she was a kid, and didn’t get sick. At the six minute mark of that clip, she chillingly says that no one dies from measles or whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Dorey, please tell that to the parents of Dana McCaffery, the baby who was just one month old when she died from whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian skeptics are trying to get the word out about this, including giving praise to the reporter (who, it should be noted, cut to a picture of Dana McCaffery right after Dorey spouted her awful, horrifying garbage). I encourage you to watch that clip (if you can stomach it), read what Maggie wrote, and then &lt;a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunday-night/contact"&gt;email the station&lt;/a&gt; about this very, very serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antivaxxers claim to be concerned about children… but their total lack of critical thinking, their denial of the research, and their wholesale belief in conspiracy theories and antiscience rhetoric is making children sick. And some of these children are dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple. Vaccinate your kids. The life you save may be your own child’s, and it may very well be the life of  a child of some other parent who doesn’t have the choice you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Larsen, a Springville delegate, offered the resolution, titled "Resolution opposing the Hate America anti-Christian Open Borders cabal," warning delegates that an "invisible government" comprised of left-wing foundations was pumping money into the Democratic Party to push for looser immigration laws and anti-family legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Larsen said Democrats get most of the votes cast by illegal immigrants and people in dysfunctional families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it's not the Democrats who are behind this strategy, Larsen said. It's the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Satan's ultimate goal is to destroy the family," Larsen said, "and these people are playing a leading part in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Larsen's resolution contained quotes from the New Testament on the battle between good and evil. The copy of the resolution handed to delegates stated it "fulfills scriptural prophecies about our times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not at all surprised — it&amp;#39;s not just Utah, but these kinds of loons are everywhere in this country, and they do not get laughed off the podium when they bring up these claims. I am impressed that they Utah GOP actually managed to reject the resolution … but it was for entirely pragmatic reasons. They said it would cost them Latino votes if they openly professed that Satan was shipping immigrants to America. They didn&amp;#39;t say that that was crazy or wrong, just that it might hurt their image with Latinos. That also didn&amp;#39;t surprise me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/utah_fails_to_condemn_satan_ak.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/uwDP5O6n0uA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240757360142"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=678">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2fdb5eaffddc2ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism/ID"/><category term="evolution"/><title type="html">What Good Is Half A Brain</title><published>2009-04-26T14:48:35Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T14:48:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=678" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=524"&gt;post for NeuroLogica&lt;/a&gt; in which I discuss the latest transitional fossil find - a pinniped (seal, sealion, walrus) ancestor that was able to walk on land (a walking seal). One commenter simply asked “what good is half a flipper.” At first I assumed the question was tongue-in-cheek, but on second thought I guess I can’t know if it is serious or not. Either way, this is a common creationist point, and like most of their points it is one they continue to make despite the fact that it has been answered for decades. In fact, Darwin himself gave a reasonable answer to this anticipated objection in The Origin of Species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise behind the question is that in order for a feature to be selected for in a Darwinian sense it would have to provide some advantage to an organism. Evolutionary forces cannot plan ahead or look to the future - they cannot select for a feature because it is on its way to becoming something useful - it has to be useful every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a good point 150 years ago, but as they often say in courtroom dramas - it has been asked and answered. There are at least five phenomena that contribute to an explanation for the “half-formed” problem in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that applies to the half-flipper question, actually, is the easiest - sometimes a structure does provide an advantage every step of the way. A half-flipper is, in fact, a perfectly useful flipper. With something like flight there is a threshold a creature must get to in terms of morphological features before they can fly at all. Therefore a wing cannot be selected for only because it will eventually be used for flight. But this is not true of swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With swimming there is a continuous spectrum from barely being able to keep from drowning to highly adapted, fast and acrobatic swimming. Each tiny incremental change in morphology equals a tiny incremental improvement in swimming, and therefore can be selected for. So the dilemma does not even exist for the case of a “half flipper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phenomenon, which Darwin himself pointed out, is called exaptation or cooption. What this means is that a structure (or behavior, or biochemical pathway, etc) that originally is adapted to one function is used oportunistically for another function. With the classic example of a wing - a half-wing may be no use for flying, but a half-wing may be a fully formed something else. Therefore theropod dinosaurs may have evolved downy feathers for insulation. These feathers then were used for display, bringing in a new set of selective forces. The display feathers then may have been coopted for slowing a descent from a high jump, or extending the length of a predatory jump, or even for trapping small animals or insects. The new function then puts new selective pressures on the feathers and protowings, which are then, for example, optimized for gliding. The gliding wings can then be coopted for full flapping flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are therefore plausible scenarios for the evolution of a wing useful for flying, without having to pass through a useless half-wing stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would expect, in fact, evolution to take such chaotic and quirky paths, making it difficult to “reverse engineer” any structure or pathway that is the end result of a long and winding evolutionary path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, Behe’s irreducible complexity (the notion that a structure is irreducibly complex if it could not function if it were any simpler) is just a restatement of this old evolutionary dilemma, solved as above by Darwin himself. Behe ignores exaptation. For example, in his infamous bacterial flagellum example - a simpler flagellum may not function (actually this too is not true, but for the sake of argument), but there is evidence that it evolved from simpler structures that were used to inject toxins into other organmisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other evolutionary phenomena which could solve the problem of how to evolve a complex structure that could not function for its current utility until it had reached a certain minimal level of complexity. One is genetic drift. Populations are always generating new biodiversity from mutations and recombination. Any features not specifically selected against could arise, survive, and undergo further modification. This change in gene frequencies or propagation of new varities is called genetic drift, because it is not being forced in one direction by selective pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, structures and pathways that arise by chance alone may, at times and quite by accident, be coopted for some new behavior or ability. Even if it provides a crude tool and a marginal advantage, it can be selected for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a phenomenon known as gene duplication. Single genes, or sometimes even sections of a chromosome containing many genes, or even entire chromosomes, may be duplicated in the reproductive process. If a creature has two forms of a necessary gene, one copy can retain the original function, while the second is free to mutate and undergo genetic drift. It is free to experiment and may hit upon some new useful function. Once coopted, this new function will then be under selective pressures and can be refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it must be recognized that not all changes are incremental or minimal. There are regulatory genes that can have profound effects on the course of development. This is the “hopeful monster” hypothesis - that most such profound changes are likely to be detrimental, but evolution has millions of years and billions of organisms to work with, so it only takes an extremely rare beneficial change to create sharp turns in the path of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together these phenomena illustrate that evolution is not a clean, predictable, steady process - but rather a chaotic, unpredictable, historically contingent one. Weird, unlikely, and complex stuff happens because of the amount of time and number of individual organisms involved. In fact, the more we understand about evolution the more complex it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we continue to drill deeper in the science of evolution, the fact of evolution becomes more and more solid over time. Meanwhile, creationists continue to raise the same old objections to evolution that have already been answered. Sometimes they rephrase them, trying to get another round of debate out of a dead issue, but usually they just repeat their debunked nonsense. This one - what use is a half-whatever - will likely be around as long as there are creationists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240756376687"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/neocarbon/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5810b8a6aa6f739</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Neocarbon</title><published>2009-04-26T14:00:12Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T14:00:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/26/neocarbon/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a spate of far-right insanity about carbon over the past week or so; it’s like a handful of Congresscritters on that side of the aisle has taken crazy pills. Or more pills than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already showed you &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/23/speaking-of-texan-doomism/"&gt;Texas goofball Representative Joe Barton&lt;/a&gt;, who thought he had a Nobel Laureate on the ropes with his oh-so-probing questions about gas and oil that revealed Barton has a second grade understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/capitol_smoke.jpg" alt="Capitol smoke"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now House Minority Leader (!) John Boehner reveals he can out-Barton Barton &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/19/john-boehners-war-on-science/"&gt;in an exchange with Geroge Stephanopoulos&lt;/a&gt; that, well, has to be read to be believed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHANOPOULOS: […] What is the Republican plan to deal with carbon emissions, which every major scientific organization has said is contributing to climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOEHNER: George, the idea that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical. Every time we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide. Every cow in the world, you know, when they do what they do, you’ve got more carbon dioxide. And so I think it’s clear…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a &lt;em&gt;carcinogen?&lt;/em&gt; Who would say something as dumb as that? Oh — he must’ve heard it from Barton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Congressman? Methane is what comes out of cows. Not CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;methane&lt;/em&gt;. Well, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from cows — they breathe, after all– but in context he obviously meant methane. You’d think with his severe case of rectal-cranial inversion Boehner’d know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, no one can hold a candle to the pile of crazy that is Michele Bachmann (R-aving lunatic) who sets the bar for &amp;quot;barking mad&amp;quot; so high that Charles Manson can only sit back in jealousy. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAaDVOd2sRQ"&gt;Listen to this monologue by her about carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, and bear in mind she has a college education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/IAaDVOd2sRQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would flunk a fourth grade science class saying that stuff. Thank heavens she’s only in the friggin’ &lt;em&gt;United States Congress!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know where to start with this. Carbon dioxide is only 0.03% of the Earth’s atmosphere, not 3%. It is most certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; harmless, as too much of it will kill you. She’s right that it’s natural, but so is arsenic. It’s also important to life, but too much will kill you just as certainly as too much water will — you can’t breathe either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how she stresses how &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is, like humans cannot make it at all. We know where carbon dioxide comes from in human industry, and we know it’s not negligible, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/how_could_we_affect_the_earth.php"&gt;we know it has an effect&lt;/a&gt;. What she spouts here is basically a stream of lies piled one atop the other. In the end of that video Representative Earl Blumenauer pretty much smacks her down, letting everyone know that she was indeed simply making stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world some of these politicians live in is as bizarre and twisted as anything I have ever seen in a cartoon. It’s incredible to me that such know-nothings are actually able to control the laws and policies of this nation. Happily though, they do eventually come up for re-election. Maybe then we can breathe easy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I came across the &lt;em&gt;Rubes&lt;/em&gt; cartoon reprinted in the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Funny Times&lt;/em&gt; (a monthly compendium of humor, from various sources, published in Cleveland Heights). I haven't been able to find a copy on-line, but here's the set-up: a little kid has hit his thumb with a hammer, cries out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*@&amp;amp;%!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and his older brother tells on him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom! Bobby said asterisk, ampersand and other assorted grammatical symbols representing comic profanity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several entertaining points here: the conceit of having the brother report that Bobby &amp;quot;said … symbols&amp;quot;; the reference to these symbols as &lt;strong&gt;grammatical&lt;/strong&gt; symbols (rather than "punctuation marks"); and the elevated diction of "representing comic profanity". (You can google up some other occurrences of "grammatical symbols" used to mean 'punctuation marks', but the usage isn't very common.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching on the web for "comic profanity", I came across the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; story, from last September. Here's Dareh Gregorian and Rebecca Rosenberg, in "The Caped Cuss-Ader: Comic's Profanity Blunder", in the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; of 12 September:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy $#!+, Batman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics is asking stores around the country to destroy tens of thousands of copies of a new Batman comic book because of a printing error that revealed a slew of obscenities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Text every friend you&amp;#39;ve got, s- - -heads,&amp;quot; Batgirl tells a group of incredibly foulmouthed, drug-dealing thugs in &amp;quot;All-Star Batman &amp;amp; Robin the Boy Wonder&amp;quot; No. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sell your poison somewhere else. This here arcade belongs to the f- - -ing Batgirl."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S- and F-words were supposed to be blacked out, but two shades of black were used, and the expletives are clearly legible, as are the thugs' A- and F-words - and even a number of C-bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;All-Star Batman &amp;amp; Robin&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t aimed at kids, it also doesn&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;mature readers&amp;quot; warning on the cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC caught the error earlier this week as the comic was heading to stores. They were able to stop some shipments, and asked retailers who got copies to destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC said "a printing gaffe" caused "a problem with All-Star Batman. As soon as the problem was discovered, we quickly asked retailers to pull the issue. We apologize to our retailers and fans for any offense or inconvenience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters on the story wondered why DC Comics printed the words in full and then blacked them out, rather than using some other avoidance scheme.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240754654480"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1376">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d536659cf689f0f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Misnegation in the Encyclopedia Britannica</title><published>2009-04-26T13:56:34Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T13:56:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1376" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Breffni O'Rourke has contributed a lovely specimen to our growing &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1350"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of cases where combinations of negations and scalar predicates leave writers and readers in a state of confusion.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although both the Gaels and the Anglo-Irish had supported the Yorkist side in the &lt;span&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/span&gt;, the Yorkist king &lt;span&gt;Edward IV&lt;/span&gt; found them &lt;strong&gt;no less easy to subjugate&lt;/strong&gt; than had his Lancastrian predecessors. Succeeding in 1468 in bringing about the attainder and execution for treason of Thomas, earl of Desmond, Edward was nevertheless obliged to yield to aristocratic power in Ireland. The earls of Kildare, who thereafter bore the title of lords deputy (for the English princes who were lords lieutenant), were in effect the actual rulers of Ireland until well into the 16th century.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

N. Rao, Nisha Yadav, Mayank N. Vahia, Hrishikesh Joglekar, R. Adhikari, and Iravatham Mahadevan, "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/1170391v1.pdf"&gt;Entropic Evidence for Linguistic Structure in the Indus Script&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;, published online 23 April 2009; also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/1170391/DC1/1"&gt;supporting online material&lt;/a&gt;) claims a breakthrough in understanding the nature of the symbols found in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script"&gt;inscriptions from the Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Two major types of nonlinguistic systems are those that do not exhibit much sequential structure (“Type 1” systems) and those that follow rigid sequential order (“Type 2” systems). […] Linguistic systems tend to fall somewhere between these two extremes […] This flexibility can be quantified statistically using conditional entropy, which measures the amount of randomness in the choice of a token given a preceding token. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We computed the conditional entropies of five types of known natural linguistic systems […], four types of nonlinguistic systems […], and an artificially-created linguistic system […]. We compared these conditional entropies with the conditional entropy of Indus inscriptions from a well-known concordance of Indus texts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We found that the conditional entropy of Indus inscriptions closely matches those of linguistic systems and remains far from nonlinguistic systems throughout the entire range of token set sizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;More specifically, this paper represents an attempt to counter the arguments made in Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Witzel, "&lt;a href="http://www.safarmer.com/fsw2.pdf"&gt;The Collapse of the Indus-Script Thesis: The Myth of a Literate Harappan Civilization&lt;/a&gt;", Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies 11(2): 19-57, 2004, discussed previously in Science by Andrew Lawler, "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2026"&gt;The Indus Script — Write or Wrong?&lt;/a&gt;", Science, 306(5704): 2026-2029, 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmer et al. have already responded briefly, in Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Witzel, "&lt;a href="http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf"&gt;A Refutation of the Claimed Refutation of the Nonlinguistic Nature of Indus Symbols: Invented Data Sets in the Statistical Paper of Rao et al.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The paper in Science on 23 April by Rao et al.  was written in response to an article that the three of us published five years ago that has led to heated polemics over India’s oldest urban society. That paper argued that the short chains of symbols on Indus artifacts were not part of a writing system but of a simple nonlinguistic sign system of a type common in the ancient world. The vision of a nonliterate Indus society has solved a number of puzzles and now has many adherents, but it has also awakened resistance from Indian nationalists and researchers whose entire careers have been linked to the Indus-script thesis, one of whom is listed as a coauthor of this study. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Conditional entropy is not and has never before been claimed to be a statistical measure of whether or not a sign system is linguistic or nonlinguistic. Rao et al. only make it appear to be relevant to that end (as we find only in their online Supplemental Information section, but not in their paper itself) by inventing fictional sets of nonlinguistic systems that correspond (pace their claims) to nothing remotely resembling any ancient symbol system. If the paper had been properly peer reviewed it would not have been published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong words. But if you read the papers involved, and understand the concepts, you should come to agree that Rao et al.'s convincing-looking Fig 1A (shown below) is indeed pretty much irrelevant to the question being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RaoFig1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you're following the play at home, note that all the conditional entropies are in nats, and all are determined relative to just one preceding character. I couldn't find a clear explanation of the "number of tokens" on the x-axis, but it appears to mean that they estimated the average conditional entropy of the choices following the symbols that occurred 0-20 times in a corpus, 20-40 times, 40-60 times, etc. The gradual increase in estimated average entropy is then presumably due to the fact that the following-symbol distribution for the less-frequent cases is increasingly undersampled. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: No, according to a message from Rajesh Rao forwarded by Richard Sproat, this is *not* what the x-axis in that plot means. Rather, for each point n, the conditional entropy was re-computed based on the transition matrix limited to the n most frequent signs in the corpus. See the simulations below.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all that I have time for this morning, but I'll come back to this topic later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'll only register a small complaint about the lede in the story "&lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/indusscript.html"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Cracks 4,000-Year-Old Mystery&lt;/a&gt;", Wired, 4/23/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;An ancient script that's defied generations of archaeologists has yielded some of its secrets to artificially intelligent computers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call a program that counts bigrams and calculates &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy"&gt;conditional entropy&lt;/a&gt; an &amp;quot;artificially intelligent computer&amp;quot; is … Well, you&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Since this is a topic that traditionally generates more heat than light, I've left comments closed. However, if you have something to say about it, write me and I'll add your thoughts as an update. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 4/29/2009: In addition to the material below, see Cosma Shalizi's discussion &lt;a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/611.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #1, 4/26/2009: It seems to me that their Fig. 1 is especially unconvincing, since a random process that made random bernoulli choices from an underlying distribution with uncertainty equivalent to about 20 equally-probably alternatives would show a similar average estimated entropy (conditional or not), asymptoting to about 3 nats as the sample size increases. It&amp;#39;s true that their Table S1 shows that the bigram entropy for the Indus symbols is lower than the unigram entropy — but a &amp;quot;topic model&amp;quot; (e.g. a hidden markov model drawing from different symbol-distributions when it&amp;#39;s in different hidden states, and switching states relatively infrequently, as if to model the construction of different inscriptions for different purposes or dedicated to different gods) would accomplish this just as well as a quasi-syntactic system would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have a few minutes, I'll link to the code for a simulation showing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Pereira &lt;a href="http://earningmyturns.blogspot.com/2009/04/falling-for-magic-formula.html"&gt;nails it&lt;/a&gt;, alas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Once again, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; falls for a glib magic formula that purports to answer a question about language. They would not, I hope, fall for a similar hypothesis in biology. They would, I hope, be skeptical that a simple formula could account for the complex interactions within an evolutionarily built system. But somehow it escapes them that language is such a system, as are other culturally constructed symbol systems, carrying lots of specific information that cannot be captured by a single statistic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2, 4/26/2009:(Removed because it was based on a misunderstanding of the X-axis in Rao et al.&amp;#39;s Figure 1A — see below for a corrected version…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything one way or another about the Indus inscriptions — it&amp;#39;s just an attempt to refute by example the claim that numbers in Rao&amp;#39;s Fig. 1 bear in any way on the hypothesis that the inscriptions represent a writing system. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 3, 4/27/2009: OK, I've learned that my analysis of the x-axis of Fig 1A was wrong. The truth is that for each point n, the conditional entropy was re-computed based on the transition matrix limited to the n most frequent signs in the corpus. So I redid things this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, this time, I used a Zipf's-Law (1/F) type of frequency distribution rather than a negative binomial as in the previous (deleted) attempt. But again, I generated fake data using  a random process without memory, so that (the expectation of) its conditional entropy values will be exactly the same as its unconditioned entropy. The Matlab code is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Indus3.m"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the resulting graph, again, has values that would fit well into the middle group of Fig 1A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Indus1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Indus1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this simulation matches the values in Fig 1A using a unigram model, without any sequential constraints at all.  And if you want a different asymptote, just change the parameters of the simple, non-linguistic urn model that I used to generate the sequences. For example, the power-law exponent in the simulation code used for the graph above was 1.7 — below are the results for 1.1 (red) 1.5 (blue) and 1.9 (black).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Indus1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Indus3a.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, there are lots of easy ways to get a difference between different-order n-gram entropies without assuming that the underlying process is anything like a writing system, as I'll explain some other morning, if there's interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, I remain deeply puzzled about the relevance of Fig 1A to the evaluation of the Indus Script hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, within a few minutes of posting this, I got email from Cosma Shalizi and Richard Sproat with their own simulations. Cosma stuck to a geometric distribution as in my original (now deleted) example, and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The entropy here is just the negative log likelihood of the estimated Markov chain divided by the sequence length.  (I happened to have Markov-chain estimating code which calculated the likelihood.)  It's the MLE of the transition probabilities, not their smoothed estimator, but that shouldn't make a huge difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pdf of Cosma's results is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ShaliziPlot.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Richard Sproat wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I get a very good fit to their results for the Indus corpus with a model that has 400 elements with a perfect Zipf distribution, with alpha=1.5, and conditional independence for the bigrams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard's Python code is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SproatCode.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the resulting graph is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SproatPlot.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240746636549"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/pat-calahan-more-than-setting-jim-carrey-straight.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5cd8e1d4384dd54e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Emergency Preparedness"/><category term="Weblogs: Roundups and Reviews"/><title type="html">Pat Calahan: More Than Setting Jim Carrey Straight</title><published>2009-04-26T11:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T11:04:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/pat-calahan-more-than-setting-jim-carrey-straight.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran across &lt;a href="http://padraic2112.wordpress.com/"&gt;Pat&amp;#39;s Daily Grind&lt;/a&gt; when following up on who was rebuking Jim Carrey for his stupidity and mendacity.  Pat wrote&lt;a href="http://padraic2112.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/in-which-i-take-jim-carrey-to-task/"&gt; In Which I Take Jim Carrey to Task&lt;/a&gt;.  So I thought I&amp;#39;d poke about and see what else interested Pat.  As it turns out, a lot of things (some titles are mine and some are Pat&amp;#39;s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise and relief, it was positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story centred around the recent death of four week old Dana McCaffery from whooping cough just two weeks out from being eligible for the vaccine. Dana lived in an area of the North Coast of New South Wales where there is a high rate of non-vaccinated children, hence the level of herd immunity is low, allowing for the spread of the disease amongst the population. The tragedy of the tiny baby’s death was highlighted by the fact that she was too young to be vaccinated, but died from a completely preventable illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporter &lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/presenter-profiles/-/4336456"&gt;Rebecca Maddern&lt;/a&gt;, emphasised the importance of herd immunity, using the example of a very young boy who had undergone a heart transplant and was therefore not strong enough to be immunised. He relies upon herd immunity as his only mechanism for prevention of childhood ilnesses. Stock footage of children with polio in calipers drove the message home that we need not go back to times when kids were crippled by polio, or died from measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of journalistic balance, we were obligated to endure the opposing view, hence, enter Meryl Dorey from the &lt;a href="http://avn.org.au/library/"&gt;Australian Vaccination Network&lt;/a&gt;. These people spread misinformation and lies about the safety of vaccination, with no remorse. As professional scaremongers, they go by the catch phrase, “love them, protect them, never inject them”. Whilst I would prefer they are not given a platform whatsoever some of the stuff spouted from Meryl on tonight’s show was enough to make you question her state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/N-63XHXxTM4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=445&amp;amp;height=364" width="445" height="364"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toni McCaffery; “..I did not want to be seen as a vaccine crusader, I just wanted to be a Mum”.  David McCaffery; “Nor is it our responsibility, it’s the responsibility of government and they need to take charge”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about childhood diseases, including whooping cough, Meryl Dorey said her mother used to just put her out with sick kids so she could get infected, and thereby gain natural immunity;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You didn’t die from it 30 years ago and you’re not going to die from it today”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny that, when the entire story is based on the death of a four week old girl from whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the reporter asked her; “What if one of your children got whooping cough? (to which she responded they had), “And did you seek help from the medical profession?”, she has this gem to offer;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, we treated whooping cough homeopathically and none of us were sick for more than 2 weeks. My vaccinated children got it and my unvaccinated children got it.  And none of us were sick for more than 2 weeks and it was nothing more than a bad cough”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(According to the story, three out of her four children are not vaccinated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued her scaremongering by bleating the much debunked vaccines-cause-autism line;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reports that we get are children who have seizures, children who become brain damaged, children who develop diabetes, who develop autism, these are serious reactions after vaccination”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report only briefly touched upon “vaccine damaged kids” with one teenager explaining he became sick one week after his first round of immunisations, but this was very brief. Mostly, we heard from doctors and scientists, such as a pediatrician describing his heart break at watching a baby turn blue from coughing. Professor &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Peter McIntyre&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.ncirs.usyd.edu.au/"&gt;National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance &lt;/a&gt; also encouraged parents to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only criticism I have of the story is that Meryl’s comments about treating whooping cough with homeopathy were left unchallenged. In my experience, many people perceive homeopathy to be a herbal treatment, and therefore assume it has some medicinal effect. Perhaps this was the case for Rebecca, since she failed to question Meryl about this quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders if Meryl’s children did in fact have whooping cough, since she described their symptoms as nothing more than a “bad cough”. A bad cough is not I the way I would describe the distressing footage which aired earlier in the story, of a baby with whooping cough gasping for air and screaming. I raised this issue with Rebecca in a congratulatory email I sent her and suggested she might like to follow it up with a story on &lt;a href="http://homeopathyplus.com.au/hplus/immunisation-issues/homeopathic-immunisation-for-meningococcal-disease.html"&gt;homeopathic vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction to the story, Sunday Night host Chris Bath called the vaccination debate &lt;em&gt;“..a wake-up message to parents which needs to end right now”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done Channel 7 for a well researched and accurate story. Please email the show &lt;a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunday-night/contact"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and let reporter Rebecca Maddern and the producers know that they are to be congratulated for accurate scientific reporting. Also there is a poll on the homepage asking whether vaccination should be compulsory. Please vote &lt;a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunday-night/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that both Rebecca Maddern and Toni and David McCaffery may be subject to abuse from the anti-vax crowd as a result of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already heard that the anti-vaxers are “hysterical” about the way they and their cause was portrayed in the story. A source revealed this response from Meryl Dorey who described the show as “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most horrible, one-sided report I have ever seen”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it was even worse than I’d feared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“. She ended her rant with “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I despair about the cover up, the children who will be injured by these shots and the way in which our organisation and the families who have been hurt by vaccines have been portrayed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to mobilise the troops. Please help by emailing Sunday Night, voting in the poll, and linking to my blog from Twitter, Facebook or your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I came on board 2½ years ago we've had a series of handlers or "community managers" who have all been competent, charming women. Punning a little, I have fondly called them my Ovarylords. To my knowledge this has not raised any hackles before. But yesterday I used the pun while criticising one of our overlords for a traffic-boosting effort that was in my opinion misguided and a little naive. Wrote I, "my Ovarylord suddenly turns into a cheerleader". This didn't go over well at all. But to my surprise it seemingly wasn't the cheerleader part that offended this woman, but my referring to ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise now that this was seen as a case of a WASP male, me, joking about an oppressed group. I can't tell jokes about Jews or black people or gays. It wouldn't be funny: it would just be seen as hostile. But I don't see the Sb Overlords as a oppressed group in relation to myself, regardless of the fact that they're women and have ovaries. On the contrary, I perceive the Sb Overlords as my bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in one of the most gender-equal countries in the world. This may paradoxically make me look like a misogynist to people in other countries since I am not conditioned to treat women as an oppressed group. Women still have a worse average salary here than men. But in Sweden, when a man jokes about women, it is not like a German joking about Jews or a white Texan joking about black people. An ovary is not necessarily an emblem of the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/dont_mention_ovaries.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/bxESz1bXI1E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240736783763"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/standing_on_the_street_is_not_a_crime">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67876b67f1e302b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Standing On the Street Is Not a Crime</title><published>2009-04-26T08:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-26T08:43:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/standing_on_the_street_is_not_a_crime" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.townoflakeshore.on.ca/businessresources/images/BabyStreetSidewalk1.JPG" height="170" alt="Sidewalk in Lakeshore, Canada from http://www.townoflakeshore.on.ca/businessresources/images/BabyStreetSidewalk1.JPG" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="220"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A friend told me that she used to live next door to a family who had a teenager on the autism spectrum. Often, she remembered, he liked just to stand in the front yard and watch the cars and passersby go by. I noted that Charlie likes to do the same. We don't have a front yard with our condo and Charlie would probably stand by the mailboxes just off the main road for long periods of time if we let him (we don't). He's usually quiet and just stands with his eyes on the street and, sometimes, his hands tucked under his chin until we direct him to cross the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this, Charlie's doing pretty much what an autistic teenager was doing, when he was beaten by Chicago police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-police-teen-autismapr25,0,3799143.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, on Wednesday night, 16-year-old Oscar Guzman was taking a break from working at his family's fast-food restaurant in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was watching cars go by when a police cruiser pulled up and two officers began asking him questions, his family says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guzman didn't understand the questions, said his sister Nubia, 25, and looked down, away and eventually began walking away. Diagnosed with moderate autism at age 4, he doesn't like confrontation, his sister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officers went after him, his family said, prompting the frightened boy to run into the family restaurant, yelling "I'm a special boy!" as he fled, his sister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Guzman's parents yelling to the officers that he was a "special boy" with "special needs," one of the officers struck Guzman in the head with a baton, cutting a gash that would require eight staples, his sister said. The parents witnessed the blow being struck, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ground, blood pouring from his head, Guzman, who has the mental capacity of a 5th grader, mumbled again and again, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I submit. I submit," his family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guzman's family is considering filing a lawsuit against the officers and believes that they should be fired. The Chicago Police Department says that the incident is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, this incident occurred in the same week that the police were promoting their "award-winning Crisis Intervention Team, a program to train officers to recognize the needs of citizens with mental illness or disabilities." A member of the team has an 18-year-old son on the spectrum. Further, the police had held their first "Autism Safety Awareness" with &lt;a href="http://easterseals.org/"&gt;Easter Seals&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly there's a desire to educate first responders about autism. But what happened to Oscar Guzman reminds us all that telling people about autism and making them "aware" is definitely not enough.  Hopefully the police department can use this incident as a starting point for discussion about what not to do, and what to do. Reading about how Guzman responded, I immediately thought of my own son and realized that he would probably respond in the same way---he'd be confused, terrified out of his senses, and run (Jim and I would be running too).  Why in the world did the officers strike Guzman with a baton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora and I have written more than a few posts about safety in general and about the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=police"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; in particular. The amount of education that needs to be done here is daunting, as evidenced by the recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/drunkenness_and_demonic_possession_are_not_autism"&gt;incident in Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; in which police thought a young man on the spectrum was &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_mistaking_disability_for_drunkenness--dangerously"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt;. We know that the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/really_not_prepared_more_on_criminal_justice_autism"&gt;criminal justice system is not prepared&lt;/a&gt; to deal with individuals with disabilities; we need to go beyond bemoaning and bewailing this and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to see some extremely impressive analysis of the situation, then you should head on over to the guys at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/"&gt;Effect Measure&lt;/a&gt;, who are putting the mainstream media to shame. But the people I'm about to present to you have a rather different take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of just how different this take is, the title of the piece I'm about to quote is "&lt;a href="http://statesecession.blogspot.com/2009/04/it-is-time-to-shoot-back.html"&gt;It is Time to Shoot Back&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they start coming for you this time it will be time to shoot back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not Americans any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not our America any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time they will be coming for your guns and they will be there to insure that if you refuse to be vaccinated or the vaccine doesn't kill you, they will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is about to become the Operation Northwood's killing fields and the last battleground for freedom...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assuming anyone will fight, beyond a few tired old men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as far as I can make out, the flu is a man-made disease that the U.S. government have created, in Mexico, in order to scare people, in the U.S., into taking a vaccine, which will then do nasty things like kill or damage the brain or otherwise taint their precious bodily fluids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things become clearer when we look at the source for some of his other articles, which is the ever-amusing &lt;a href="http://www.rense.com"&gt;rense.com&lt;/a&gt; (a bit like whale.to but with worse graphics). One of their pieces is &lt;a href="http://www.rense.com/general85/wicked.htm"&gt;particularly enlightening&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTENTION AMERICA!!!! This is highly significant. The WHO "Pandemic Control Room" is a creation of the Illuminati elite for the final "end-game" killer virus mapping and tracking, and is thus equipped with super-computers tied to all U.N. member government's security forces.  This "control room" is where any declarations of "pandemic" will originate. When such a "declaration" is sent to President Obama, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security "Pandemic Task Forces" will be deployed. Each State Governor will be notified that the provisions of the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that all Americans must consent to mass vaccinations, or be guilty of a FELONY crime (without a TRIAL, mind you!). And why a FELONY and not a mere 'misdemeanor'? Simple.  Police agencies know that the use of "DEADLY FORCE" is only approved for felony suspects when they resist arrest.  Refuse the government's untested, untried, highly suspect "MADE IN CHINA" vaccine, and you will instantly be labelled a felonious criminal. So, refuse the forced vaccine, and then resist forced relocation to a prepared "quarantine compound" (i.e. concentration/re-education camp) and you can "legally" be shot and killed. (Justified "deadly force".)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, don't laugh, there is one pretty solid piece of evidence backing this up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama makes an official visit to Mexico, and a short week later, Mexico City schools, Universities, and all PUBLIC BUILDINGS are shut down in pandemic fear -- (for the first time since the devastating 1985 earthquake!) Again, is this just a bizarre co-incidence??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, who better to carry out a secret act of biological warfare on a neighbouring country than the president during a visit with his entourage of officials and journalists providing a handy cover? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you want to keep up with this conspiracy as it unfolds, I'd recommend you head on over to Twitter and start following &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SuperGodiva"&gt;@SuperGodiva&lt;/a&gt; , who is keeping her readers up to date on all the latest developments, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swine Flu reported as unusual as it affects the most healthy (20-45) vs weak kids/elderly. Perfect pathogen to quell dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are going to take a lot of quelling...&lt;/p&gt;

Ever wonder if creationists’ guillibility has any limits? Well if you have, the answer is no…no, they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the discovery made by &lt;a href="http://footbullet.net/2009/04/13/the-magnetic-fields/"&gt;one blogger who decided to prank call the Word of Faith Christian Center&lt;/a&gt; with some amusing bogus  news stories that would rock their creationist brains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put in a call to the Word of Faith Christian Center and spoke to a lady who immediately shared my concern when I told her that I had recently heard news of scientists who were creating a magnetic field to stop Jesus from returning to Earth. We prayed together that these scientists be stopped and that atheism be crushed with the full force of God’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it gets worse. They then called back later and told them that Obama admitted to being a secret Muslim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another call to the Word of Faith Christian Center, I spoke with a man who seemed confused, at first, when I told him that Barack Obama had just admitted to being a Muslim and performing the Salaat, as he hadn’t heard anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then told the man that I was calling from Perth in Western Australia, and the conversation went as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re a day ahead of us… Do you guys get news before us sometimes?”&lt;br&gt;
“Uh, yeah…”&lt;br&gt;
“So we’ll be hearing about this later? Oh what a tremendous revelation that we were deceived!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it had only just happened in Australia (which is “in the future”), he prayed a preventative prayer to stop it happening in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, that’s the problem with all us “Evolutionists.” We’re not thinking fourth dimensionally! When you get to Australia, “those Indians won’t even be there!” Sorry, couldn’t resist! I bet you didn’t even know the Earth moved at 88 miles per hour, did you? Learn something new every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/crime/bal-pushia0424,0,3230832.story"&gt;Kevin Jerome Pushia is like a lot of pastors&lt;/a&gt;. He befriends the developmentally disabled. He persuades them to list him as a beneficiary on insurance policies. He then hires a hit man with $50,000 in church funds to rub them out  so he could collect life insurance money. You know, the way Jesus would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s quite organized too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A terse notation in Pushia’s planning calendar for Feb. 5, the day after [Lemuel] Wallace was found dead in a Leakin Park bathroom stall from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and back, reads: “L.W. project completed,” police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it’s safe to say religion is not to blame for this, though perhaps Pushia’s plot was made all the easier given his trusted position in the church. Though that’s purely conjecture on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got just 4 words for Mr. Pushia:  “Movie Rights” and “Call me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case somehow someone out there was still not convinced that Michelle Bachmann is one of the stupidest people to ever be elected to office in the U.S., in just 3 minutes, she supplies more than enough evidence that this is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know I said in the headline that her stupidity is all natural but who am I kidding? Such stupidity isn’t merely there from birth. No, it takes a team of expert morons teaching him from kindergarten all the way through higher education and beyond to contribute in making a person this stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, according to Ms. Bachmann, if something is natural, then it’s good for you. You know what else is natural? Cyanide. Arsonic. Methylmercury. Hemlock. Cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know where to begin with this one, so I’ll pass it over to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/minnesota_once_again_embarrass.php"&gt;PZ Myers to refute some of her more idiotic statements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Coyne characterizes those organizations’ positions as meaning that NCSE “cuddles up to [religion], kisses it, and tells it that everything will be all right.”  John Wilkins, who AFAIK does not second Coyne’s motion, even has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/04/science_and_religion_for_indiv.php" rel="external "&gt;a multiple-choice question&lt;/a&gt; on the issue going.  This post grew out of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/04/science_and_religion_for_indiv.php#comment-1590277" rel="external "&gt;a comment I made&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Coyne has made a surprisingly confused argument against a straw man, and I’ll outline why below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let me make a couple of disclaimers.  Recall the Panda’s Thumb policy regarding contributors (which is currently not visible for some reason).  Basically, posts on Panda’s Thumb are the views of the post authors and not of some corporate “Panda’s Thumb.”  We all differ on one or more issues, and we argue about them publicly and privately, sometimes with great vigor.  This is one of those issues.  What I post is from me, not other PT authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I am an atheist.  On the late (and by some, lamented) Internet Infidels Discussion Board where I was an administrator, my sig said I was 6.5 on the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=742" rel="external "&gt;Dawkins scale&lt;/a&gt; on which Dawkins himself laid claim only to a 6.  (I’m now &lt;em&gt;consigliere&lt;/em&gt; to the administrators of &lt;a href="http://www.secularcafe.org/index.php" rel="external "&gt;The Secular Cafe&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, I’ll first describe one plain fact: &lt;em&gt;people exist who are both religious (Christian) believers and competent, even distinguished, scientists&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense of actually doing standard science in a context like a secular university or industrial laboratory and publishing in the peer reviewed scientific literature. Those people (excluding the presuppositionalists of the AIG, ICR, and Disco ‘Tute sort) do not in their scientific work invoke supernatural entities as causal or explanatory variables. If one reads their scientific papers one finds that they address genuine scientific issues without reference to angels, demons, gods, or intelligent designers. Their papers in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; are indistinguishable from the papers of scientists who are not religious believers. So it follows that individual scientists can make some sort of accommodation with their religious beliefs &lt;em&gt;that does not impact their science&lt;/em&gt;. It is quite obviously the case that one can be both a religious person and a working and productive scientist: they exist and in at least some cases (Kenneth Miller, Francisco Ayala) flourish in a scientific environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is what Coyne is arguing against, and there he’s confused.  Reading &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/" rel="external "&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; one actually sees that he’s making a false claim.  Let me illustrate it by a representative quotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a professional organization makes such strong statements about the compatibility of science and faith, and ignores or gives but a polite nod to the opposing view, that organization is &lt;em&gt;endorsing a philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “strong statements” are apparently such radical claims as this quoted by Coyne from the NAS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of the evidence for evolution can be compatible with religious faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many [religious denominations] have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Coyne quotes this from NCSE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In public discussions of evolution and creationism, we are sometimes told that we must choose between belief in creation and acceptance of the theory of evolution, between religion and science. But is this a fair demand? Must I choose only one or the other, or can I both believe in God and accept evolution? Can I both accept what science teaches and engage in religious belief and practice? This is a complex issue, but theologians, clergy, and members of many religious traditions have concluded that the answer is, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyne adds &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t get much more explicit than this.  To those of us who hold contrary views, including the idea that religion is dangerous, this logic sounds like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are sometimes told that we must choose between smoking two packs a day and pursuing a healthy lifestyle.  Many cigarette companies, however, hold unequivocally that no such choice is necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How on earth is it a “strong statement … endorsing a philosophy” to make existence claims that are so easily defended?  Those denominational statements exist, just as individual scientists who are religious believers exist.  Coyne is here tilting at a windmill of his own making.  What “opposing view” is there – that those denominational statements and individual scientists don’t exist?  Bah.  NAS has not taken a “philosophical” position that I can see.  (I pressed Francisco Ayala on this a few months ago.  He mentioned that Steven Weinberg was on the drafting committee that wrote the statement.  Weinberg is not particularly soft on religion.)   The NAS statement points out two plain facts: some good scientists are believers and some denominations do not see a conflict between their version of Christianity and evolution.  That Coyne believes that religion is dangerous (a sentiment that I largely share: it can be dangerous to self and society to listen to voices inside one’s head or to those whose only claim to authority is a private pipeline to one or another god) is irrelevant, a &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;.  The question is whether people can both hold some sorts of religious beliefs and do good science, and as I noted above, that is a plain fact, and it is not &lt;em&gt;endorsing&lt;/em&gt; a philosophical position to observe that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after a bit of diversionary fluff claiming that he “enormously admires” NCSE and its current leaders, Eugenie Scott and Kevin Padian, Coyne specifically attacks NCSE’s approach.  He writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pro-religion stance of the NCSE is offensive and unnecessary – a form of misguided pragmatism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baloney.  Pure unadulterated knee-deep baloney.  First, of course, NCSE’s statements are not &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt;-religion; they are restatements of the facts I noted above: Some good scientists have religious beliefs, and some Christian denominations publicly aver that their theological views and science do not conflict.  Now, they may be mistaken – Coyne would say they are – but that does not say anything about the existence of their claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Coyne has constructed a straw man, that NCSE and NAS and AAAS &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; particular religious views, and rants against it.  He is in this respect not all that different from Larry Caldwell and his wife, who &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/14/MNM915T5JB.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1" rel="external "&gt;brought suit&lt;/a&gt; against the University of California Museum of Paleontology’s and NCSE’s &lt;a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/" rel="external "&gt;Understanding Evolution&lt;/a&gt; site because it claims, like NCSE, AAAS, and NAS, that science and religion &lt;a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php#d1" rel="external "&gt;can be compatible&lt;/a&gt;, again, a plain statement of fact: those people exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m one of the foot soldiers in this battle, a sergeant operating in a conservative rural county far from the ethereal heights of the University of Chicago.  I’ve been at it (off and on, mostly on for the last 6 years) for more than 20 years.  I published my first article on the political nature of the evolution/religion conflict in 1987.  I am engaged at the local and state levels, the former on a weekly basis (search this blog on “Freshwater” for local stuff and see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/the-win-in-ohio.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for just one example of State BOE stuff).  My political experience goes back to 1968, when I was a big city Democratic party ward officer.  I have a hell of a lot better view of what’s pragmatically necessary and what is effective at the level of the local school board and the local church than Coyne can even imagine.  Coyne (and Myers and Moran and Dawkins) are not engaged at that level on anything approaching a regular basis.  They lead their congregations from high pulpits.  They sit above the choir preaching a message that is disconnected from – indeed, sometimes antithetical to – the reality on the ground.  They’re the generals who argued against air power, courtmartialed Billy Mitchell, and then watched ships sink at Pearl Harbor.  Coyne wants to argue philosophy in a political war.  That’s not a tactic, it’s a politically lethal red herring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value Coyne’s contributions to science and I like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-True-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0670020532/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1240705453&amp;amp;sr=8-1" rel="external "&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; a whole lot – I bought it and I use its arguments and information where they’re appropriate.  But he’s tactically ignorant and apparently doesn’t know the nature of the battle on the ground.  Dueling OpEds in the NYTimes are not the venue in which this war will be won or lost.  Political battles are not won by generals; they’re won by foot soldiers on the ground, often in spite of the diversions of the generals.  The creationists know that approach; we scientists don’t, by and large.  They know it’s a political war.  We haven’t done so well at realizing that political wars are won one household, one school board, &lt;em&gt;one church&lt;/em&gt; at a time.  NCSE knows that, and knows what it takes on the ground.  To win those battles we don’t need generals who are ignorant of the nature of the issues on the ground.  We need advocates who are not hampered by generals who divert and hamper them with ill-advised philosophical and tactical sermons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a 3-Sunday series of talks on religion, evolution, and morality in a local Protestant church recently.  Had I walked in there and opened with “OK, folks, in order to understand and accept evolution as I’ll present it today, you have to deconvert” I’d have lost my (overflow) audience in the first five minutes.  That would have robbed me of the opportunity to introduce &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; people to the power and breadth of the theory and to describe the misconceptions that the fundamentalist Christians have been feeding children and adults in my community.  And that’s a losing strategy, Jerry.
&lt;/p&gt;

What horrible words they use to describe each other!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=BoraZ+cilantro" title=""&gt;asked why&lt;/a&gt; is this and searched &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=cilantro" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://beta.friendfeed.com/search?q=cilantro" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; for discussions, as well &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander" title=""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=cilantro&amp;amp;btnG=Search" title=""&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=cilantro&amp;amp;btnG=Search" title=""&gt;Scholar&lt;/a&gt; for information about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - cilantro is the US name for the plant that is called coriander in the rest of the world. In the USA, only the seed is called coriander, and the rest of the plant is cilantro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - there are definitely two populations of people: one (larger) group thinks that it is the best taste ever, while the other group thinks it is awful. The latter group is not simply incapable of tasting cilantro - they can taste it in minuscule quantities hidden in food and describe it as "dirty dish-soap water taste". People who cannot stand cilantro leaf are perfectly OK with eating the coriander seed. So, it is something in the leaf that makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third - anecdotal information from scouring the Web suggests ("me and my Dad hate it...") that the type of response to cilantro is inherited. It is also not experiental (those who hate it, hated it when they were kids, those who love it sometimes first tried it when they were already old and loved it at first try, and the response does not change with age, amount, kind of food preparation, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth - there is no scientific literature that I could find on the genetics of this. Is the difference at the level of the gustatory (or olfactory) receptors, or at higher-level processing centers in the brain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth - there is one paper that shows that the type of response to cilantro taste has nothing to do with the individual being a supertaster or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixth - There are a few older papers that identified chemical compounds in the leaves of cilantro, and a few about the allergy to cilantro, but no final identification of the compound that makes the difference in taste to the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does anyone else know more about this? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, be nice to people who are not your cilantro-type - they cannot help it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/do_you_love_or_hate_cilantro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/-VhGe7MMLPk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240696840501"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8064946606387348810">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac0ddfd9a2b0632b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Science in the Media:Put Up or Shut Up</title><published>2009-04-25T21:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T22:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/science-in-mediaput-up-or-shut-up.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8064946606387348810/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8064946606387348810" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Kathy Sykes is a professor of sciences and society at the University of Bristol (UK).

When the child got off the bus with "facial cuts and facial, neck and chest bruises," the bus driver and bus aide (who were both substitutes) told the boy's father, Roy Woolery, that "at the bus stop that they had turned their heads for a minute and when they turned back, they assumed he had pinched himself." But the bus's security videotape revealed that the 7-year-old was assaulted by another student;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The boy's mother, Shannan] at the bus stop that they had turned their heads for a minute and when they turned back, they assumed he had pinched himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She said (the bigger boy) would hold down my son with one hand and with the other hand would just beat him with a closed and open fist and was choking him. (The bus driver and aide) would notice it and step in, and that happened on and off continuously on that bus ride," Woolery said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither adult separated the boys, Woolery said the investigator told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7-year-old has had nightmares and his behavior has regressed since the incident. He has been reassigned to another bus. His parents have requested to see the videotape but, as Shannan Woolery says, they "'would never be allowed to see it.'" She has made a formal request to do; further, an investigator from the Children's Division has told her that she is "trying to get the Greene County Juvenile Office," as the case involves "child-on-child" violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the &lt;a href="http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904250347"&gt;News-Leader&lt;/a&gt; story is &lt;a href="http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904250347"&gt;Officials shrug off bus beating, says autistic boy's mom&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, too, the bus driver and bus aide did not complete an incident report on April 17th, and the runaround the Woolerys are getting suggests that officials are more concerned about making sure they're got themselves covered. But what about the students on the school buses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this is an opportunity to reflect on the tremendous progress we’ve made so far. On the other hand…the UN set &lt;a href="http://www.rbm.who.int/worldmalariaday/countdown.html"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; as the date for uniform malaria coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;em&gt;614 days&lt;/em&gt; left until the day set as the target.  The plan is that by 2010:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of people at risk from malaria are using locally appropriate vector control methods such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLins), indoor residual spraying (irS) and, in some settings, other environmental and biological measures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of malaria patients are diagnosed and treated with effective anti-malarial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treatments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in areas of high transmission, 100% of pregnant women receive intermittent preventive treatment (iPT);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the global malaria burden is reduced by 50% of the 2000 levels: ~175-250M cases annually and less than 500,000 deaths annually from malaria. &lt;a href="http://www.rbm.who.int/worldmalariaday/keyfigures"&gt;&lt;img title="figure2-21" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/figure2-21.gif?w=300&amp;amp;h=207" alt="figure2-21" width="300" height="207"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph &lt;a title="PDF" href="http://www.rbm.who.int/worldmalariaday/index.html"&gt;from the Global Malaria Plan&lt;/a&gt; shows the projected effects of these interventions on different timelines.  Acting quickly &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we, as individuals in the US, do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net/its-easy-to-help/"&gt;Nothing but Nets&lt;/a&gt; is one way to contribute.  Let major pharmaceutical corporations know you applaud (and expect!) their efforts to lower pricing on malarial drugs.  Lastly, let your legislators know you support funding for malaria research and aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one is hard–right now things are pretty tight in the US for a lot of people. Personally, I may actually have to abandon our house and let it go into foreclosure, if we can’t sell it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m still so, so privileged to live in a place with clean water and electricity on demand and little threat of infectious disease (relatively).  Don’t forget that even now, as financial times are hard, we &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; are pretty darn lucky compared to our brothers and sisters in Africa, Asia, and South America struggling with malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

But equal opportunity doesn't have to mean "exactly the same as."  The presence of an opportunity, and how that opportunity is actualized, are two different ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tennessee, an AS student with 19 colleges courting him is having trouble getting a high school diploma &lt;a href="http://www.wreg.com/sns-ap-tn--historywhiz-diploma,0,7787475.story"&gt;because of algebra&lt;/a&gt;.  In the UK, an AS student who has conditionally been accepted at Cambridge was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/20/aspergers-school-rejection-cambridge"&gt;denied admission to high school&lt;/a&gt;.  And in less-exotic-to-me Portland, Oregon, I talked with support staff about how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Prince-Hughes"&gt;Dawn Prince-Hughes&lt;/a&gt; became an expert with a PhD on a GED and a series of independent studies.  Either because of the rigidity of the educational system, or because of our own personal learning style not fitting well with the educational system, doing education the same way as others may be neither appropriate nor desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions that come up a lot when I talk with people about access to post secondary education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Is it possible to go to college with a modified high school diploma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What if general education requirements outside of Interests are too hard to manage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What if being in a classroom is too hard to manage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. What if standardized tests are too hard to manage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know a single "correct" answer to those questions, but I do know a lot of little possibles.  I also know that the rigidity of the educational system in the U.S. is a huge barrier for non-traditional learners.  But, on the hopeful side, there are also some "back doors"--ways around these barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modified (or other-non traditional high school) diploma?  No experience personally, but parents in my area have reported that colleges don't care as much as is often threatened.  I do know that when one is in high school a disproportionate amount of weight is put on the connection between high school and college.  Wait a few years after high school graduation, and many colleges don't even ask for a transcript.  Some colleges even have admission processes that are about personal essays, portfolios, and experience, not about diplomas or SAT scores.  Or--this is something I've done personally to bypass admission requirements--take a few classes at a university without applying for admission; then use the university transcript instead of the high school (or, in my case, undergraduate) transcript.  There are options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen. ed. issues?  Heh, this one I am quite familiar with.  I skipped gen. ed. with a specialized bachelors, and then grad school--well there is no gen. ed. for that!  Try a degree that doesn't require, or has minimal requirements for gen. ed., such as a fine arts degree for artists, or a specialized technical associates degree.  Or, perhaps even better, choose an accredited university which allows students to design their own curriculum, like &lt;a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/"&gt;Evergreen&lt;/a&gt;.  A third option is to work out alternatives for a particularly difficult gen. ed. class as a disability accommodation (e.g. substituting a course that is possible for one that is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classroom issues?  Online schooling and distance learning is becoming more and more available.  Then there's the mentoring route a la Prince-Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standardized tests?  This is another one I'm familiar with.  While some universities may shout, "REQUIREMENT!" my personal experience has been that standardized tests can waived on grounds of disability and with proof of ability in those areas the test is intended to measure (e.g. can this person succeed at university courses?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but the main point is that just because the educational system is ridged, or ill suited to us, or because the idea of "must do the same things as everyone else" is in vogue, does not mean we must do things the same way as everyone else "just because."  For those of us who the system doesn't work for, there are other ways to achieving the same results, to truly give us equal educational opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240683063233"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e18c85a0d4220a0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">GeoCities Confidential</title><published>2009-04-25T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/geocities.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Eight-year-old rumor finally comes true: Yahoo has announced they will be shutting down GeoCities.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240682718892"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/say-what-you-mean-bear-witness-iterate.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/babf293d4e3899d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stories About Me"/><title type="html">Say what you mean.

&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/09/wormseyeview"&gt;A Worm&amp;#39;s Eye View&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend&amp;#39;s wife is dying. She has been headed undeviatingly to this end, to this room of her own at the far end of the neurological ward on the seventh floor, for fifteen years at least, ever since she started to stumble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I last saw her, in the observation ward next door, she was completely immobile, vegetal, in her wheelchair. Now, when she lies in bed there are fragments of sudden movement, none of which seem to be connected to anything. It is like watching an ocean liner go down, as the water floods the different switchboxes: lights go on and off in the ballroom; in the cargo hold a crane rattles across the ceiling, chains swinging. The master&amp;#39;s wheel suddenly twirls decisively. But the master and all the crew fled long ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Ford"&gt;John M. Ford&lt;/a&gt; responded with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worm drives helically through the wood&lt;br&gt;
And does not know the dust left in the bore&lt;br&gt;
Once made the table integral and good;&lt;br&gt;
And suddenly the crystal hits the floor.&lt;br&gt;
Electrons find their paths in subtle ways,&lt;br&gt;
A massless eddy in a trail of smoke;&lt;br&gt;
The names of lovers, light of other days --&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps you will not miss them. That&amp;#39;s the joke.&lt;br&gt;
The universe winds down. That&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s made.&lt;br&gt;
But memory is everything to lose;&lt;br&gt;
Although some of the colors have to fade,&lt;br&gt;
Do not believe you&amp;#39;ll get the chance to choose.&lt;br&gt;
Regret, by definition, comes too late;&lt;br&gt;
Say what you mean. Bear witness. Iterate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnmford.com/"&gt;John M.

&lt;p&gt;It's also precisely my position on the matter. There are many people who argue that religion provides a &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; evolutionary advantage — I find them unconvincing. Thomson is explaining how religion&amp;#39;s origin is indirect, as a byproduct of properties of the brain that we find useful in modeling our world and social interactions…and religion is a parasite that hijacks these traits to promote a caricature of these properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday I worked my way through the hundred's of comments on PZ's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_pro-test.php"&gt;I am Pro-Test&lt;/a&gt; post.  One theme that kept cropping up was that a great deal of animal testing is unnecessary, and that informed and attentive consumers should be able to kill the demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought, therefore, that it would be worth returning to a question I talked about a while ago, in a single paragraph of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/08/dvd_review_physicians_speaking.php"&gt;fairly lengthy DVD review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Why do animal tests continue when cruelty-free products are available?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We're going to have to really struggle to find an ethical rationale for &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/crime/bal-pushia0424,0,3230832.story"&gt;this pastor's monstrous behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Baltimore pastor who worked with developmentally disabled people was charged Friday with befriending a blind and disabled man in his care, then paying a hit man $50,000 in church funds for an execution so he could collect life insurance money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Police say Kevin Jerome Pushia, 32, who worked for four months as an operations manager for the Arc of Baltimore before abruptly quitting in January, confessed to plotting to kill Lemuel Wallace.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Pushia told police he persuaded Wallace and "numerous" other mentally challenged individuals to list him as a beneficiary on insurance policies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A terse notation in Pushia's planning calendar for Feb. 5, the day after Wallace was found dead in a Leakin Park bathroom stall from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and back, reads: "L.W. project completed," police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Errm, Pushia must have wanted the money so he could perform good works, and he was helping Lemuel Wallace to be happier in heaven with Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it would be easier to admit that religion is ineffective at imposing any kind of socially useful moral code, but is a handy disguise for the amoral among us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/clerical_collar_fails_to_insti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/uh-Pm8EC-X8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240675790120"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/torture_sean_hannity.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38510f7ffea5b14d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Torture Sean Hannity?</title><published>2009-04-25T16:38:05Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T16:38:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/4nuguHY4qx4/torture_sean_hannity.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/torture_sean_hannity.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I heard that Sean Hannity had jauntily offered to allow himself to be waterboarded, I confess to a moment's small, viciously gleeful anticipation.

She opens:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scientists want to see more science and technology in the media, but we're making life hard for ourselves by forever criticising each other's efforts or denouncing journalists and film-makers for not portraying science in ways we approve of. While healthy debate can improve science communication, I think we could all shut up a bit, and stop the more rabid criticism altogether. I include myself here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Prof. Sykes is not a biologist, which may account for the fact that she sees little wrong with stunts like New Scientist's recent "Darwin Was Wrong" inanity:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXkJYbOgGUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/66gj6P_kqWk/s400/currentcover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:125px;height:165px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SXkJYbOgGUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/66gj6P_kqWk/s400/currentcover.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Similarly, New Scientist recently took flak over its cover that proclaimed "Darwin was wrong". The article inside described discoveries that are leading to modifications to the theory of evolution. A cheap trick to sell magazines while giving fodder to the enemies of evolution? Sales certainly went up that week, but if more people than usual bought the magazine and read the article, more people will have found that scientists agree that Darwin was fundamentally right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The problem, as pretty much every evolutionary biologist knows too well, is that most people who seek to undermine science will use the cover and not read the article.  It was irresponsible, and it damaged New Scientist's standing with scientists, without a doubt.  I certainly have a much lower opinion of the magazine at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, I agree with Prof. Sykes's frustration on another point:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have ranted and railed at scientists and journalists who treat tentative results as if they are certain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But, she continues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Does ranting do any good? In some cases it does, especially if science is being carelessly mangled or deliberately distorted. But in many cases communicators are passionate about science and are simply trying to communicate it as clearly as they can to as large an audience as possible. We risk drowning out what's good with a stream of public bickering. We also risk discouraging a new generation of communicators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What's the solution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you're still troubled by how others communicate, why not spend less time ranting and get out there and communicate in ways you do like? Blogging is easier than ever, for example.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The thing is, lots of researchers do have blogs.  And they use them for many purposes, such as: 1) criticizing inaccurate journalism (usually including clarification of the subject), 2) explaining new discoveries to a broad audience, and 3) praising good journalism.  My blog certainly does this, as do many of the blogs I follow.  In other words, the ranting is hardly decoupled from clarification in many cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My feeling is that Sykes is a little disconnected from the main issues as they are seen by scientists, especially since many of the most vocal critics of bad reporting are also engaged in communicating science themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is inaccurate science reporting better than no reporting at all?  I think it is an open question.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-2698224805717805818?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/S8RAsv6b9Vw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240674387478"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7599869413719060958">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6487d28d8c00e79e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DNA barcoding" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Postdoctoral position in molecular identification ("DNA barcoding") of pathogens and disease vectors.</title><published>2009-04-25T14:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T14:46:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/gTa4X8Chjh0/postdoctoral-position-in-molecular.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7599869413719060958" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/postdoctoral-position-in-molecular.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Outstanding applicants are sought for a two-year postdoctoral position at the University of Guelph, focusing on the development of molecular identification methodology ("DNA barcoding") for a wide range of pathogens, parasites, and disease vectors.

In this sense, the lessons provided by historians and philosophers can be relevant for modern science.  Familiarity with the history of science is also critical for effective teaching, so again, historians can play an influential role in improving science education.  This is true not only for university-level science courses taught by professional scientists, but also in protecting education standards at the high school level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is an example of that -- Dr. Abigail Lustig, a historian at the University of Texas Austin, presenting her testimony before the Texas Board of Education.  It is very brief, but eloquently clarifies the crucial distinction between evolution as fact and as theory, and the substantial difference in historical debate and timing of acceptance of Darwin's ideas on these two issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/08zw7jkLZf4%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For my take, see &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/21p11486w0582205/fulltext.pdf"&gt;Evolution as fact, theory, and path&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;E:EO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-5395675741317911508?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/LltnoE7OUFk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240673906944"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/25/differential-elemental-ablation-of-micrometeoroids/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f69df46845c004bb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Differential elemental ablation of micrometeoroids</title><published>2009-04-25T15:37:42Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T15:37:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/25/differential-elemental-ablation-of-micrometeoroids/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I love the jargony science speak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title refers to something I find totally cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space is not empty. This close to a star like the Sun, even after billions of years, space is filled with junk. Tiny bits of rock, ice, and metal are everywhere, the leftover shrapnel from asteroid collisions, or detritus sloughed off of comets. Every day, the Earth plows through many tons of such material, which mostly burns up in our atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/10/stardust_meteor.jpg" alt="Stardust reentering Earth’s air"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009GL037389.shtml"&gt;Scientists have now detected for the first time&lt;/a&gt; (PDF journal paper &lt;a href="http://www.cora.nwra.com/~diego/2009GL037389.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that as a particle enters our atmosphere, the different materials in it burn off at different times. They found that sodium and potassium burn off first, when temperatures are still low in the meteoroid. As the little chunk of cosmic fluff penetrates deeper into our atmosphere, the air thickens and the meteoroid heats up. When it hits about 1800 K (1500 C or 2800 F) materials like silicon, iron, and magnesium that have a higher vaporization energy — that, is, need to get hotter to vaporize — start to burn off. At 2500 K (2200 C or 4000 F) the calcium, titanium, and aluminum finally boil away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s amazing to me is that were able to determine this at all. The micrometeoroids we’re talking about here are very tiny, maybe 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; grams — in some cases, too small to see. Even at the bigger end that’s a tiny little piece of debris. Normally, the chemicals in an object like this would be measured using spectra — breaking the light up into colors and examining them; different elements emit different colors of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these meteors are too small to create enough light to measure. So scientists got clever: they used radar! Radar reflects off of ionized air, and the amount of ionization — the amount of free electrons in the air — changes the strength of that reflection. By carefully measuring just how strongly a meteor reflects radar as it burns up, scientists were able to figure out just when various elements burned off the hot little visitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time measurements like this have been done, and show that this appears to be the main method that micron-sized particles of metal get into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, the region of the atmosphere around 100 km (60 miles) high. That may not seem terribly important, but this is one more component that makes up the vastly complex  tapestry of the Earth’s atmosphere. Every time a new puzzle piece falls into place is a time when we understand a little bit more about the ocean of air above our heads. And since we need it to, say, &lt;em&gt;breathe&lt;/em&gt;, I’m glad there are folks out there working so hard to piece it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I’m fascinated by meteors. These little guys come screaming in from outer space, booking along at dozens of kilometers per second relative to us. They slam into our air, heat it up, vaporize, and leave that lovely and ephemeral glowing tail stretched out behind them. There’s always a thrill, a shock, when you see one, and it’s hard not to gasp and say &amp;quot;Oooooohhhhhhhh!&amp;quot; when one flashes into your field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like everything else in the Universe, there are multiple facets to meteors; we can appreciate them for their sudden flare of beauty and surprise… and we can also study them to see what they can teach us. Science and beauty are two sides of the same coin, and don’t let anyone ever tell you differently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240673526148"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/minnesota_once_again_embarrass.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49d5a73cd9ddcb2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Minnesota once again embarrassed by Michele Bachman</title><published>2009-04-25T16:15:03Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T16:15:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/fofRTwVbx_0/minnesota_once_again_embarrass.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/minnesota_once_again_embarrass.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michele Bachmann gave a science lecture to congress. As you might imagine, this was a grand spectacle of stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/IAaDVOd2sRQ%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few things that jumped out at me (I'm sure you can find more by listening carefully, but I could not bear to pay too much attention).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She repeats over and over that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a natural gas. Yes, we know…no one is claiming otherwise. (Also, what would an &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; gas be, anyway?) Nitrogen is also a natural substance, it helps plants grow, and we produce perfectly natural nitrogenous materials from our bodies — so does that mean that we should stop sewer services and allow everyone to wallow in their poop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She claims that not one study has ever been produced to show that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is harmful, and she goes further to claim that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a &lt;i&gt;harmless&lt;/i&gt; gas. We could correct that in just a few minutes: give me a large tank of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a small room containing Michele Bachmann, and we'll give her a personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere is 3% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;? Is she really that ignorant? It's more like 0.03%. And again, no one is arguing that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is evil — it&amp;#39;s that its concentration has distinct effects on the temperature of the planet, and that concentration is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize, world. We'll try harder to get this loon out of office at the next election. Until then, could you all either just ignore her, or point and laugh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is excellent news. Having read her book, as well as Richard Evans' account of the trial, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lying-About-Hitler-History-Holocaust/dp/0465021530/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1240666156&amp;amp;sr=1-7"&gt;Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial&lt;/a&gt;, I had always thought that the story of David Irving's ill-fated attempt to silence Professor Lipstadt by suing her for libel in the U.K., whose libel laws are notoriously plaintiff-friendly, would make an excellent movie. It has it all: Drama, fighting against long odds, and, above all, a villain who is a caricature of the worst of British blowhards, David Irving. (On second thought, it doesn't have romance; hopefully the producers won't try to add a cheesy romantic subplot...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that optioning the rights to a book is a long way from actually shooting a movie and that many are the stories whose rights are optioned that never find their way onto film. Even so, I don't think it's too early to start making casting suggestions. Even though it's a very obvious choice, I vote Meryl Streep to play Professor Lipstadt. However, that leaves the question of who could play David Irving. Irving himself, in a characteristically lame attempt at humor, has &lt;a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/08/09/JChron_190908.html"&gt;suggested John Cleese to play Lipstadt&lt;/a&gt;. How droll, Mr. Irving, and, no, Anthony Hopkins is not a good option to play you, unless he does it as Hannibal Lecter, although Jack Nicholson might be a good option if he's in full &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; mode. However, having John Cleese play Irving would make sense, especially if he does it in his full-out Basil Fawlty mode. I could totally picture that. Or maybe Rowan Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, hey, that's just me. What about you? Who should play David Irving in a movie about the Lipstadt trial?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/who_should_play_david_irving.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/F56TOLr6--Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240669906040"><id gr:original-id="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/?p=366">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6526cf482ee9a37d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative Medicine"/><category term="General Skepticism"/><category term="homeopathy"/><title type="html">My Family Members Aren’t Immune</title><published>2009-04-25T14:31:29Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T14:31:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/2009/04/25/my-family-members-arent-immune/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, my aunt sent me the name of a ‘nutritional supplement’ that her cousin had sold her sometime back.  When she first told me about it, I pointed out that it sounded fishy.  I did some research on the product, and found that it a product sold through a multi-level marketing company called “&lt;span&gt;FirstFitness&lt;/span&gt;“.  The website is more dedicated towards promoting new distributorships than its products, and like most &lt;span&gt;MLMs&lt;/span&gt;, stresses how the participants can quit their stressful, high income jobs and work from home a few hours a week, and eventually win a Mercedes, dream vacations, and the like.  Of course, you have to sign up 10 people, who each need to sign up 10 people…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was persuaded to buy something called &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;a title="Lipomax 10" href="http://*%20there%20have%20been%20some%20studies%20of%20milk%20thistle%20on%20liver%20disease%20in%20humans,%20but%20these%20have%20been%20small.%20some%20promising%20data%20have%20been%20reported,%20but%20study%20results%20at%20this%20time%20are%20mixed.%20%20%20%20%20*%20although%20some%20studies%20conducted%20outside%20the%20united%20states%20support%20claims%20of%20oral%20milk%20thistle%20to%20improve%20liver%20function,%20there%20have%20been%20flaws%20in%20study%20design%20and%20reporting.%20to%20date,%20there%20is%20no%20conclusive%20evidence%20to%20prove%20its%20claimed%20uses.%20%20%20%20%20*%20recent%20nccam-funded%20research%20includes%20a%20phase%20ii%20study%20to%20better%20understand%20the%20use%20of%20milk%20thistle%20for%20chronic%20hepatitis%20c.%20additional%20research,%20cofunded%20by%20nccam%20and%20the%20national%20institute%20of%20diabetes%20and%20digestive%20and%20kidney%20diseases,%20includes%20studies%20of%20milk%20thistle%20for%20chronic%20hepatitis%20c%20and%20nonalcoholic%20steatohepatitis%20%28liver%20disease%20that%20occurs%20in%20people%20who%20drink%20little%20or%20no%20alcohol%29.%20%20%20%20%20*%20the%20national%20cancer%20institute%20and%20the%20national%20institute%20of%20nursing%20research%20are%20also%20studying%20milk%20thistle,%20for%20cancer%20prevention%20and%20to%20treat%20complications%20in%20hiv%20patients./"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lipomax&lt;/span&gt; 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, advertised as a homeopathic remedy to ’support optimal liver function’  and  ‘&lt;span&gt;help&lt;/span&gt; relieve the symptoms of bloating, fatigue, water                      retention, allergies, sluggish bowels and a sluggish metabolism.’  That’s some powerful stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients include ground dandelion seed, ground Celandine stem, milk thistle powder, and a ‘proprietary blend’ which is 99% turmeric extract, turmeric being a &lt;span&gt;spice&lt;/span&gt; that gives mustard its characteristic yellow color and is a component of many curry powder blends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For milk thistle, I did find that some research has been done, through the National Institute of Health, but through the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicines.  If you’ve kept up with the news, you’ll remember that the sponsors of this center have been disappointed that the research has turned up no efficacy in anything they’ve studied to date.  As far as milk thistle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;There have been some studies of milk thistle on liver disease in humans, but these have been small. Some promising data have been reported, but study results at this time are mixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although some studies conducted outside the United States support claims of oral milk thistle to improve liver function, there have been flaws in study design and reporting. To date, there is no conclusive evidence to prove its claimed uses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent &lt;span&gt;NCCAM&lt;/span&gt;-funded research includes a phase II study to better understand the use of milk thistle for chronic hepatitis C. Additional research, &lt;span&gt;cofunded&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span&gt;NCCAM&lt;/span&gt; and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, includes studies of milk thistle for chronic hepatitis C and nonalcoholic &lt;span&gt;steatohepatitis&lt;/span&gt; (liver disease that occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Nursing Research are also studying milk thistle, for cancer prevention and to treat complications in HIV patients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;nada&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My quick search of the dandelion and celandine showed even less promise – all the links were to natural or homeopathic sites, and talked about the wonders of these all-natural ingredients, and how they have been used ‘well known and used throughout Europe’ which apparently is meant to confer status.  The sites claim that these herb promote health, aid digestion, improve liver function (apparently most of us are going around with non-functioning livers), prevent colds, inhibit tumor growth, improve appetite, cure yeast infections, and decrease glucose levels.  Considering that my aunt is a diabetic, I’m not sure that taking dandelion capsules would be a good idea, if it really did change glucose levels in the blood willy-&lt;span&gt;nilly&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my aunt was a bit embarrassed, and threw the stuff away.  I suggested that she take the company’s money-back guarantee to heart and get her $35 back.  She needn’t be embarrassed.  I don’t know the cousin who sold her the stuff very well, but I recall that she is a bit incredulous about a great many things (she out one time belonged to a religious group who thought they could raise people from the dead), and was likely merely trying to supplement her income.  The herbal, natural, and homeopathic supplements generate billions of dollars in sales each year, so there are a lot of well-intentioned, educated people who are uninformed about what is being sold, legally.  Oprah is a big source of unsubstantiated garbage.  For instance, she touts &lt;span&gt;Acai&lt;/span&gt; berry, and sales increase dramatically.  Wikipedia states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently, the &lt;span&gt;açai&lt;/span&gt; “berry” has been touted and marketed as a highly beneficial &lt;a title="Dietary supplement" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt;. Companies sell &lt;span&gt;açaí&lt;/span&gt; berry products in the form of &lt;a title="Tablets" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablets"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Juice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Smoothies" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothies"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, instant drink powders, and whole fruit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketers of these products make claims that &lt;span&gt;açai&lt;/span&gt; provides increased &lt;a title="Energy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; levels, improved &lt;a title="Sexual" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual"&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; performance, improved &lt;a title="Digestion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Detoxification" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"&gt;detoxification&lt;/a&gt;, high &lt;a title="Fiber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title="Antioxidant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; content, improved &lt;a title="Skin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; appearance, improved &lt;a title="Heart" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health, &lt;a title="Sleep aid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_aid"&gt;improved sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and reduction of &lt;a title="Cholesterol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; levels. More dubious claims include reversal of &lt;a title="Diabetes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a title="Chronic illness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_illness"&gt;chronic illnesses&lt;/a&gt;, as well as expanding size of the &lt;a title="Penis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt; and increasing men’s sexual virility and sexual attractiveness to women.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_Palm#cite_note-0"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_Palm#cite_note-1"&gt;[2] &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a title="Weight loss" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As of March 2009, there are no &lt;a title="Scientific control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt; studies backing up any of these claims. According to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="ABC News" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; correspondent Susan Donaldson, these products have not been evaluated (in the &lt;a title="United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;) by the &lt;a title="Food and Drug Administration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, and their efficacy is questionable.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_Palm#cite_note-james-2"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In late 2008, lawyers for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="The Oprah Winfrey Show" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show"&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt; began investigating alleged statements from supplement manufacturers who suggested that frequent &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oprah guest Dr. &lt;a title="Mehmet Oz" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mehmet&lt;/span&gt; Oz&lt;/a&gt; had recommended their product or &lt;span&gt;açai&lt;/span&gt; in general for weight loss.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;a title="(Link)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_Palm"&gt;(Link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best we can do is to educate, gently, one person at a time. This morning, my mom sent me another one of those emails about how &lt;span&gt;Swiffer&lt;/span&gt; cleaning solution kills pets, and added this note:  ” thought I’d send it on just in case. please don’t google it and correct it,  just delete.”  She meant, don’t send her a link fromSnopes about how this is not true.   I of course looked it up, and found that it not only wasn’t true and had numerous factual errors, the manufacturer of &lt;span&gt;Swiffer&lt;/span&gt;, Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, had issued press releases about the misinformation being circulated.  Someone sent that link to my mom, someone who had probably received it via email on a list with hundreds of other email addresses in the chain, and some people would stop buying a perfectly safe product, and pass the email along yet again.  I love my mom, and I’m not criticizing her, but she didn’t want to know the truth, and certainly didn’t want to respond back to the person who sent the email to her.  And that is why bad information persists against the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

A $370 fine just for using the word &amp;#39;poof&amp;#39;, even within the family?  What next?  Jail time just for calling one&amp;#39;s clumsy husband a stupid bastard?  Family life would collapse. Intrafamilial insults are part of a great British tradition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, studying of the fine detail of the article (in the &lt;i&gt;Metro&lt;/i&gt;, a free UK newspaper) revealed that it wasn't a matter of word use at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother, one Celia Duncan, actually swung her car around in a U-turn on seeing her estranged son holding hands with his boyfriend in an Aberdeen street, screeched to a halt behind the two boys, and as they fled in terror over a wall and into some woodland, she chased them, hollering "Fucking poofs!"  Later she went further, with a voicemail: "I will get you, believe me, and you will get your fucking head kicked in."  Finally she underlined it by texting: "I will get you and your poof."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Poof' (which has the vowel of &lt;i&gt;put&lt;/i&gt;, not the vowel of &lt;i&gt;poo&lt;/i&gt;) is a familiar and rather mild deprecatory term for homosexuals, familiar in the variant form "poofter" from an early Monty Python sketch about a homophobic Australian philosophy department.  It is dismissive, and nobody using it in anger or contempt would retain my respect; but my impression is that it is not as hostile or ugly as the American English term &lt;i&gt;fag&lt;/i&gt;.  And anyway, I don't think that our response to "hate speech" should ever be the legal tabooing of individual words.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, &lt;i&gt;poof&lt;/i&gt; has not been entered on some index of words that will get you fined $370 if you use them around the house.  Nor should it be, in my view.  This story is not about lexical choice or linguistic freedoms.  Rather, the moral of this story is that running after a 16-year-old kid threatening to kick his fucking head in for holding hands in with someone he has feelings for is not legal in Britain, even if the boy is your biological offspring.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celia Duncan was fined but spared the prison sentence that might ordinarily be expected to follow a threat of death or grievous bodily harm.  Her son Stuart will presumably continue to find the company of his boyfriend more appealing than that of his homicidally inclined mother.  But it's not a linguistic issue.  The Language Log Free Speech division and Word Taboo Response Team can stand down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The title is a blend of the French words &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Anglais&lt;/span&gt; "English" and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;laid&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot; — perhaps it could be approximately translated as &amp;quot;Uglish&amp;quot;.  And M. Brûlé&amp;#39;s argument, according to the synopsis on his web site, is a rather odd one, at least from the perspective of historical plausibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Longtemps, la suprématie de la France a rayonné sur le monde entier. De tout temps, les Français ont néanmoins reconnu les nombreux apports des différentes langues et sociétés au patrimoine culturel mondial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;De nos jours, la culture anglo-saxonne domine le monde. Qu’elles soient britanniques ou américaines, les élites anglo-saxonnes ne s’intéressent qu’à elles-mêmes. Musique, littérature, dramaturgie, il n’y en a que pour les œuvres de langue anglaise créées par des locuteurs anglais. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For a long time, the supremacy of France illuminated the entire world. At all times, the French nevertheless recognized the numerous contributions of different languages and societies to the cultural patrimony of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;These days, the anglo-saxon culture dominates the world. Whether they are British or American, the anglo-saxon elites are interested only in themselves. Music, literature, drama — there is nothing but English-language works created by English speakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MichelBrule.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MichelBrule.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a recent interview with Catherine Girouard ("&lt;a href="http://www.journalmetro.com/linfo/article/216309"&gt;Michel Brûlé : Celui qui a l’anglais comme ennemi&lt;/a&gt;", Métro Montréal, 4/21/2009), he tries a different tack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Q: Qu'est-ce qui vous a poussé à écrire ce livre?&lt;br&gt;
A: J’ai fait une observation révolutionnaire très simple, qui est que le «Je», «I» en anglais, est hypertrophié en étant toujours en majuscule. Cela change la façon de désigner l’autre. C’est un cas unique en linguistique. Et les gens sont tellement obnubilés par l’omniprésence de l’anglais qu’ils ne se sont même pas rendu compte de cette évidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Q: What drove you to write this book?&lt;br&gt;
A: I made a very simple revolutionary observation, which is that the English "I" is hypertrophied by being always capitalized. This changes the way one looks at the Other. It's a case unique in linguistics. And people are so confused by the omnipresence of English that they don't even notice this evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-media version of his message is also available in the form of the remarkable music video for his song &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7xBZXMp6Y"&gt;Poubelle&lt;/a&gt; ("Garbage"), inspired by his &lt;a href="http://www.proddauphine.com/brule.php?page=contenu&amp;amp;id_rubrique=5"&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; that "la culture anglo-étatsunienne est devenue tellement dégénérée qu’il vaut mieux en rire" ("Anglo-UnitedStatesian culture has become so degenerate that it's better to laugh about it"). At about 1m36s into the video, you can see Brûlé and his dancing girls adding Canadian and American flags to a growing pile of hamburgers, pizza, breakfast cereals, Coca Cola, Hollywood videos, toilet overflow, and other symbols of la culture anglo-étatsunienne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for his song &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FIK3zj4pws"&gt;Königsberg&lt;/a&gt; is less obvious; but for those who may be puzzled about why he's singing in German about the loss of East Prussia to the Russians, he &lt;a href="http://www.proddauphine.com/brule.php?page=contenu&amp;amp;id_rubrique=5"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Avant de devenir Kaliningrad, ville russe depuis 1946, Königsberg a été allemande pendant 692 ans. À noter que Königsberg veut dire Montis realis en latin d’où vient le nom de Montréal. Verra-t-on un jour Montréal devenir Montreal ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Before becoming Kaliningrad, a Russian city since 1946, Königsberg was German for 692 years. Note that Königsberg means Montis realis in Latin, from which comes the name Montréal. Will we one day see Montréal become Montreal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube comment: "Pis cé toué qui parle de préservé notre langue gros tabarnack?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Though I think that would be &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;mons regius&lt;/span&gt; in Latin, wouldn't it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defense Association of Anglophone Quebec &lt;a href="http://daaqinternational.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/press-release-stop-hate-literature-in-its-tracks/"&gt;wants to see him prosecuted&lt;/a&gt; under Canada's preposterous hate-speech laws. If this happens, it will be one more argument against those deeply misguided statutes, in my opinion. However, the distribution of competitive government subsidies is obviously a different matter, and according to &lt;a href="http://www.michelbrule.com/coor.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on Brûlé's web site,&lt;/p&gt;

But it was not as I thought: &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; of the other four invited commenters (Patricia T.  O'Conner of &lt;a href="http://www.grammarphobia.com/"&gt;Grammarphobia.com&lt;/a&gt;, Stephen Dodson of &lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/"&gt;Language Hat&lt;/a&gt;, Ben Yagoda of &lt;a href="http://www.benyagoda.com/yagoda-on-writing.php"&gt;BenYagoda.com&lt;/a&gt;, and Mignon Fogarty the &lt;a href="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/"&gt;Grammar Girl&lt;/a&gt;) are distinctly critical.  &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; gets a rough ride. Perhaps not as rough as I would like, but never mind, there is a developing consensus here that I approve of.  (And E. B. White himself might even have approved; he thought that &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/~myl/languagelog/archives/001908.html"&gt;no smooth ride is as valuable as a rough ride&lt;/a&gt;.) Dodson reminds us that on Language Hat he has called &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; "the mangiest of stuffed owls", a book that has been "undercooked and overpraised" (I &lt;b&gt;knew&lt;/b&gt; I liked this guy). &lt;a href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/happy-birthday-strunk-and-white/"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, once the moderator had spent the necessary 48 hours digging out from under the gigabytes of comments that had been flying in at the speed of light, hundreds of comments appeared below the prepared remarks of the five invitees; and they are overflowing with the sort of righteous pothering and ad hominem attacks that I had been expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know (can I talk frankly with you, since you're Language Log readers?) I get so sick of seeing the same allegations again and again.  I hate the allegations and I despise the alligators.  Once again I see that someone does a price comparison of a used paperback copy of &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; with a brand new hardback copy of &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Now first, even if you can get &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; for a dime, that's not much use if its advice is hopelessly &lt;b&gt;wrong&lt;/b&gt;.  Second, they play a double game.  People who don't know about &lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt; say "Who's this guy we've never heard of who doesn't know shit from Shinola, criticizing our wonderful little book?  Who anointed him the big expert?"  But those who do know that I co-authored a major reference grammar of English play a different game: they say it's too big of too expensive or whatever to be a &lt;b&gt;rival&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;, and accuse me of being &lt;b&gt;jealous&lt;/b&gt;, as if my goal had been to get hundreds of thousands of college students and technical writers carrying &lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt; around with them in specially manufactured gigantic canvas pockets bolted into their clothes.  For heaven's sake, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt; is not intended for college freshers!&lt;/b&gt;  It's a great big fat ugly reference work and &lt;b&gt;I never mentioned it&lt;/b&gt; in connection with why Strunk and White are bumbling grammar idiots or what students should read instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing in the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; comments that I've seen elsewhere is a commenter asserting that I &lt;b&gt;lack a sense of humor&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; is really just joking.  That&amp;#39;s why it deliberately breaks all its own rules, see!  It&amp;#39;s just a merry joke!  Well, if it&amp;#39;s just humor, I wonder why students aren&amp;#39;t told that.  (Would a Dave Barry &amp;quot;Mr Language Person&amp;quot; column do just as well?)  And why do all these bigwigs rhapsodize about the book with tears in their eyes if it&amp;#39;s jus&amp;#39; foolin&amp;#39; and none of its rules are seriously meant?  I assume these &amp;quot;Pullum has no sense of humor&amp;quot; people are not Language Log readers, are they.  Or maybe they are.  Perhaps I ought to tag all my posts with the &amp;quot;Humor&amp;quot; tag…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on, comment if you like, I don&amp;#39;t care anymore.  Do your worst…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, before I go, one more thing.  I'm also seeing commenters say that the book you should really have is Henry Fowler's &lt;i&gt;Modern English Usage&lt;/i&gt;!  What the hell is going on here?  Fowler's book dates from 1926.  It's a third of a century older than &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;; and Fowler was a marked eccentric even then.  Some of his articles are very scholarly (he was a man who really did know grammatical analysis), but some are completely quixotic.  Others are pages and pages of weird raving about things he just happened to have bees in his bonnet about (he prattles on for a page about "Irrelevant allusion", for example).  Some of it is very interesting for a serious English language scholar.  But as a guide for writers in the 21st century?  A book that was clearly in preparation more than a hundred years ago, by a man born in 1858?  When Harper's and American Heritage and Merriam-Webster all have much better books out?  What is this epidemic of nostalgia?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

I responded by saying...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not really. For every person who believes that a certain story is allegorical, metaphorical, or symbolic, I guarantee that I could find another person who believes it is entirely literal. I further guarantee that each person could use hermeneutics to find textual justification for their respective positions. What does this say? How can one definitively determine literal from figurative? Is the resurrection of a dead man allegorical, metaphorical, and symbolic? If not, why not? “Most people understand that the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;resurrection&lt;/span&gt; is full of allegories, metaphors, and symbolism.” How is that statement less valid than the one above?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact of the matter is that those who argue that the Bible is an allegorical, metaphorical, or symbolic book belong to a generation that has merely retreated from the position of their predecessors. Apologists for religion have changed over the years, just as apologists for other pseudoscientific disciplines have incorporated new interpretations for more recent evidence that debunks their disciplines. The first ghost photographer was found to be a fraud when living people started showing up in his pictures, but this doesn’t discourage the field from forming new explanations for subsequent ghost photographs.  The first spirit-rapper confessed that the otherworldly sounds in her sessions were the popping of a joint in her big toe and not communications from the dead, but this doesn’t discourage the field from continuously pressing the validity of subsequent ghost whisperers.  The first footage of Bigfoot was admitted to be a hoax by the man who made the suit and the man who wore the suit, but this doesn’t discourage the field from forming new explanations for subsequent films.  The first verifiable crop circles were made by two men who confessed to having invented the whole idea in a pub, but this doesn’t discourage the field from forming new explanations for subsequent crop circles.  Abductees alleged that the first space aliens told them that they came from Mars and Venus, but once scientists determined those worlds to be inhospitable to life, abductees talked of subsequent abductors hailing from far away solar systems.  In this same manner, once science destroyed a literal reading of the Bible, the book retreated into the realm of symbolism and other such explanations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7212978192900993346?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sometimes it all just comes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie had a hearing test yesterday. He and Jim and my parents and me (the family that goes to testing for The Boy together sticks together) all went to the rehab section of a local hospital. The testing was done by an audiologist in a small sound-proof booth (so my parents had to stay in the waiting room---no room in the booth for all). The audiologist put squishy (best word to describe them) yellow headphones on Charlie's ears and, after first testing to make sure he didn't have any ear infections or swelling (he's had maybe two ear infections since he got ear tubes in April of 1999), she had sit in the booth at a little table (so little that Charlie tilted the table when he pulled up his knees under it). Jim and I went over a laminated sheet of pictures with Charlie and he identified all of them except for one of a cowboy (but if it had been a train conductor......).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another audiologist sat outside the booth and said a series of words that sounded alike (socks/clocks); the first audiologist held up a card with eight or so pictures on it and Charlie had to point to which one was said. He'd been asking for a break and saying he was done after the initial testing; with the audiologist sitting beside him and holding up the card, he settled immediately into "school-time mode" and smiled at Jim and me across the table (I was sitting at it; Jim stood by). And Charlie identified almost all the words correctly on the first try, and gladly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the first audiologist pulled out a color-shape-pegboard toy that Charlie used to have once upon a long long time ago (as in, when he'd last had his hearing tested---spring of 1999). She took off all the foam shapes and instructed Charlie to listen for a beep from the headphones and, on hearing the beep, to put the foam shape on the matching-colored peg. She gently held Charlie's hand so he wouldn't put the foam shape on the peg till he heard the beep and after just a few rounds, he got it, and did the beep/put-shape-on-colored-peg activity twice over, and gladly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're done!" the audiologist proclaimed with a smile. She explained the test to Jim and me: Through the headphones, Charlie had heard words and beeps said at different volumes; he could hear these even when in a whisper, and his hearing is within normal range. Jim and I noted that Charlie had last had his hearing test when we lived in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Charlie was just being diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it had been basically impossible to test his hearing, let alone test him. The audiology exam was one of many tests that Charlie had to do in a two-day evaluation at the Child Development Center at the Minneapolis Children's Hospital. He struggled just to stay in the testing area and in the room for each test and not to cry, scream, or otherwise make it clear, he wanted &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;. For the audiology test, he had to stay in a small room (I can't remember if Jim and I were allowed to be with him) while a series of noise-making animals (bear with cymbals, bear with drums, other stuffed creatures with mini musical instruments) appeared out of the wall. Charlie didn't really look in the direction of the noise; he was crying for much of the test, as it was, and the audiologist and Jim and I had to mutually, sadly, agree that we couldn't really do more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to yesterday afternoon, Charlie sitting in the tiny sound booth, alert, grinning at times, talking, frowning and furrowing his eyebrows---"that's ten years" Jim said, and we both were thinking of all the efforts, hours, struggle that we and so many teachers and therapists had invested to educate Charlie. It occurred to me that he hadn't had a hearing test till now because he wouldn't wear headphones until a few months ago (his current teacher taught him to wear them); because it was thought that it'd be "too hard" for Charlie to go through the test. It took effort and concentration on Charlie's part to do the test, to look at the pictures and understand what was asked of him. But rather than groaning at the prospect of having to concentrate and focus, I think Charlie was eager to do so. He's certainly used to doing these at school and, after being on Spring Break for a week, his face suggested that he was relieved to be back in "school-time mode."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie ran out of the booth to see my parents. Jim and I followed slowly, eager to relate the latest chapter of Charlie's accomplishments and very, very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; proud.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240638211210"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3065">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe02c52ccb13bc27</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="Astrology"/><category term="Bulgaria"/><category term="Emil Leshtanski"/><category term="psychic"/><title type="html">Another astrologer failed and didn’t see it coming</title><published>2009-04-25T05:40:32Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T05:40:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/another-astrologer-failed-and-didnt-see-it-coming/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/04/astrologer-in-trouble.html"&gt;&lt;img title="psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c.jpg?w=223&amp;amp;h=138" alt="psychic-crystal-ball_1114702c" width="223" height="138"&gt;This time it’s a Bulgarian astrologer named Emil Leshtanski&lt;/a&gt;, who predicted 800,000 people would be killed by a massive earthquake that would hit the city of Haskovo on Easter night. And guess what happened. Yup, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the abysmal track record of psychics and charlatans didn’t stop hundreds of people from sleeping in tents and in their cars for fear of being crushed by collapsing buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I bet Leshtanski wishes something horrible did happen to all those people because they’re majorly pissed off and want to prosecute Leshtanski for spreading false information and inciting a panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur Scientist doesn’t think this warrents legal action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to two years in jail. But while it’s always good for a fraud to be so publicly exposed, I’m not sure prosecution is in order. People, after all, should have freedom of speech. Though it could be said that telling an entire city they’re all going to die is the same as shouting “fire” in a crowded theater. Still, it’s not unreasonable to assume that the person shouting “fire” might have actually seen a fire. But believing someone who says the Earth is going to shake because of how the stars are positioned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I disagree. I’m a huge free speech advocate but one of the few exeptions to free speech I agree with is the proverbial “shouting fire in a crowded theater” and I think this absolutely is akin to the “shouting fire in a crowded theater” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leshtanski incited panic and hysteria, which endangered lives. And while I love Amateur Scientist, I think he runs the risk here of seeming like he’s blaming the victims for being gullible enough to believe a reading of the stars signaled threat. But whether it’s shouting fire or a baseless Chicken Little-like cry that the sky is falling based on astrological signs, its just as real to those driven to a panic. So I’m happy that the stars are telling me a prison cell is in Leshtanski’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan, &lt;a href="http://www.allnewsweb.com/page6696692.php"&gt;the Kazakhstan government has allegedly decided their money would be best spent on building the world’s first alien embassy, as in space alien embassy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;If these reports are to be believed, the authorities have already allocated a large plot of land in the city of Almaty for this ambitious project. Facilities to be built within the complex will include a guesthouse, theatre and translation service. A purpose built UFO landing pad and checkpoint will be attached to the embassy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;Kazakhstan’s government believes open contact with aliens is imminent and by being the first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;nation to specifically create such facilities they are convinced they will reap enormous financial and economic rewards. The Kazakhstan Government also see this as a chance to demonstrate their nations forward thinking policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has got to be an elaborate prank because I find it hard to believe that Kazakhstan could possibly thikn their nation is more forward thinking than the rest of Western world. And wouldn’t it occur to them at all that the space aliens might not be anything like us and might not have any use for such things as a theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just no way this is real story. If this would true, it’d make every comedian’s day. It’s just too absurd, far more absurd than Borat’s “Running of the Jew” festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There most recent &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/jenny-mccarthys-autism-cr_b_190486.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, is by Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald.  Wow, a doctor, sounds scientific and medical, maybe there is something bad with vacinations…. oh, wait, Huffington Post &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Fitzgerald is a licensed acupuncturist, certified clinical nutritionist, and a homeopath. She has a Master’s Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Doctorate in Homeopathic Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah she’s a doctor, but she’s a doctor in a bunch of crazy, made up, potentially health threatening lies. Listening to this lady is like bringing your car to a mechanic who has a doctorate in flying carpets, except she wants to kill or cripple your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone needs to call out the Huffington Post for supporting the nuts who want you and other people to not vaccinate your children.   I don’t care who it is, liberal, conservative, whatever.  I also think hosts like Keith Olberman need to stop using commentators from Huffington Post, as it has no credibility if it is willing to run this crap.  In fact, Keith should make Huffington Post, or at least these contributors the worst people in the world on an upcomming show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, these people would rather your kid had measles, mumphs, chicken pox, smallpox, polio, etc, than got a vaccine that has scientifically been shown again and again to not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

My request is a simple one. I would like skeptics and Christians alike to call for a debate between myself and Dr. William Lane Craig on the topic, &lt;em&gt;Is Christianity more probable than atheism?&lt;/em&gt; Use your Blogs and websites to issue this call if you would.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never mind for the moment that my friend and former professor Bill Craig has basically &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/dr-william-lane-craig-i-will-not-debate.html"&gt;said he won’t debate me&lt;/a&gt;. If people were stopped so easily from pursuing their goals this world would be a different place. He can change his mind. People do all of the time especially when pressure is put on them to do so. On a recent poll many people think I &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/craigloftus-debate.html"&gt;would win such a debate&lt;/a&gt;, even if most think I will lose it. About that poll I wonder if some of the Christians who voted I would lose probably just think that since the skeptics are wrong then there is no way any skeptic can win a debate against any Christian apologist. And I wonder if many of the naysaying voters have &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;read my book&lt;/a&gt; or seen me debate against David Wood on the problem of suffering, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/07/loftus-v-wood-debate-is-now-online.html"&gt;seen here&lt;/a&gt;, which most people think I won. Keep in mind that in the debate I had with Wood I did not know in advance how he would argue. But when it comes to Bill Craig I have been a student of his works and debates and I pretty much know his arguments inside and out. He would have to come up with something completely new to surprise me. But I think I could surprise him with a debate strategy I won’t reveal until the time comes to debate him, if it comes. I have watched Craig’s debates enough to know what to say and I want to surprise him with something so different he’ll be taken aback. I am sort of an expert on Craig. I’ve followed him for years, first as a student, and now as a skeptic. I probably know Craig and his work better than most other skeptics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many skeptics are now hesitant to encourage debates with Craig because of the recent losses coming from &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/william-lane-craig-won-by-landslide.html"&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2009/03/craig-debate-wrap.html"&gt;Richard Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, who said: “As I had predicted, I didn't win the debate.” Carrier debated Craig even though he admitted he expected to lose. I do not expect to lose. At the very minimum I expect to hold my own, and I think I could win. I have a habit of succeeding when others tell me I cannot do something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eddie Tabash is actually calling for a debate between Craig and me even though he watched in person as Hitchens lost the debate with Craig. I’d like for others to join Tabash if you think one of the premier skeptical debaters on our age knows what he’s talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to debate experience I think I’ve had more of it than most of the skeptics who debate Craig. Most all of the skeptics that Craig has debated probably never debated before, and some of them win, like most recently &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/is-god-necessary-for-morality-william.html"&gt;Shelly Kagan&lt;/a&gt;. The only skeptics who have had a great deal of experience in formal debates are probably Eddie Tabash, Dan Barker and Hitchens. So even though I don’t have as much formal debate experience as they do, it may not matter since I'm sort of an expert on Craig. Besides, I’ve been winning debates ever since I won an argument against my 7th grade math teacher and all of the other students in that class over a math problem. And I debate these issues every single day here at DC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason I’m Blogging about this is to try to get Bloggers all over the web to call for this debate, from both skeptical and Christian Blogs. If you’re a Christian why wouldn’t you want to see such a debate? And if you think I’ll be trashed then why wouldn’t you want to see me eat my words? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The saying goes, “if you build it he will come,” and I think if you Blog it Craig will come around. Is he scared of me or something?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-4739577208625624962?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resist this temptation!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noted in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_6.php"&gt;part 7&lt;/a&gt;, there are good reasons that we (by which I mean scientists and the public) ought to be engaging in dialogue about issues like research with animals.  Avoiding dialogue altogether would mean cutting off the flow of information about what actually happens in animal research and about how animals actually matter to scientists and non-scientists alike.  Given that what the public knows and cares about has some influence on how much public money is allocated to support scientific research and on what kinds of laws and regulations govern the treatment of animals (including the treatment of animals in scientific research), opting out of dialogue altogether is a risky move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in this post, I offer suggestions for how to have a productive dialogue about animal research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_7.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_7.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/yXl8JARMPPM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240620188049"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1295">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08de2f0eaf99ca97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Media Reporting of Research: Consistently Poor</title><published>2009-04-24T22:33:41Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T22:33:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/media-reporting-of-research-consistently-poor/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">In fact, I think that the only thing that is consistent about the mainstream media’s reporting of research (particularly research that relates to health) is that it is poor.

While items like wheelchair ramps might be useful to some of my friends they aren't really for me, so at first I was at a loss as to what to request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered someone telling me about newfangled toaster ovens and cooking devices that can be set to automatically turn themselves off.  I don't use the toaster oven (or stove, or any sort of Thing That Heats Up) unless someone's around because I tend to wander off and forget I've turned stuff on. This, obviously, is dangerous and bad.  But "smart ovens" or "smart stoves" might be just the ticket.  I'm a long-time user of technology to replace "executive function" areas I'm weak in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/technology_news/4216434.html"&gt;smart houses&lt;/a&gt; and how a house might be souped up to improve quality of life, increase safety, and reduce stress and strain.

dog. To people who don't love dogs, it probably seems silly to be so upset over an animal, but
he was really a member of the family, and losing him really knocked me for a loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'm trying to first get caught up on my book schedule, so I haven't had time for any
substantial blog posts. But while I was bumming around, a comment showed up on one of my old
posts. For background, several times in the past, I've written about the Lords Witnesses, a
Jehovah's Witness spinoff group that claims to have discovered a "bible code" by which prophecies
are embedded in the bible. They've been predicting that Manhattan will be hit by an atomic bomb.
They've proposed somewhere around 20 different dates. Their latest prediction was April 4th of
this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; My last post about the Lord's Witnesses and their goofy prophesies was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/return_of_the_bible_code_bozos.php"&gt;back in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. But this week, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/return_of_the_bible_code_bozos.php#comment-1576620"&gt;new comment&lt;/a&gt; on that post showed up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It's an amusing comment. The gist of it is that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; has discovered the
	one true bible code; that everyone else who's found bible codes is really just being
	duped by Satan, and that anyone who doesn't accept the truth of his one true
	bible code is an agent of Satan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/04/yet_another_bible_code_bozo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/04/yet_another_bible_code_bozo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/hSutPDibm50" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240608882504"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullying_at_any_age_is_wrong">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2262c5a7d82a792</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Bullying At Any Age Is Wrong</title><published>2009-04-24T21:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T21:22:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullying_at_any_age_is_wrong" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.uplanddesigngroup.com/Cafeteria-2.jpg" height="180" alt="High school cafeteria from http://www.uplanddesigngroup.com/Cafeteria-2.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="230"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My school district, like many others around the nation (if I may be US-centric, not knowing how this topic is being addressed in other countries), has a number of policies, initiatives, presentations, task forces, and the like against &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullies_can_go_away"&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. I'm glad these exist though (to be my cynical self), I have to wonder how much these sorts of programs accomplish as far as changing the hearts and minds and manners of children to "have empathy" and the like for their peers, and especially if those peers are different. Charlie, due to his needs, is never without a teacher or aide when he's at school, and does not have to deal with the social battleground (if you want to see it that way) of the school cafeteria. But I've heard plenty of stories from parents about their children on the spectrum (one mother noted how, whenever her son sat at a table in the cafeteria, everyone got up and left) and from adults who recall their own experiences. Reading about what happened to 23-year-old Theresa Murphy in Blackburn town center in the UK makes it clear, bullying can happen at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy, yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/4314484.Anger_as_yobs_prey_on_vulnerable_Blackburn_woman/"&gt;Blackburn Citizen&lt;/a&gt; reports, has autism and epilepsy and had gotten off a bus when "when she was 'bullied' into handing over the cash to yobs." Murphy gave them the £70 that she had with her to make them go away and later had her first seizure in 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/4314484.Anger_as_yobs_prey_on_vulnerable_Blackburn_woman/"&gt;Blackburn Citizen&lt;/a&gt; simply notes that there needs to be more understanding (well, obviously) and that police are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until we accept that individuals with disabilities are not "abnormal" and "weird" and other unnecessary stereotypes, bullying isn't going to end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240607459450"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/handy-compilation-of-refutationsrebuttals-for-anti-vax-claims.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aed5210d287d1e49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Vaccination"/><title type="html">Handy Compilation of Refutations/Rebuttals for Anti-Vax claims</title><published>2009-04-24T20:19:04Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T20:19:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/handy-compilation-of-refutationsrebuttals-for-anti-vax-claims.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="AntiAntiVax: Home" href="http://antiantivax.jottit.com/"&gt;AntiAntiVax: Home&lt;/a&gt;.</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240606487307"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8513176334554375162">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac6c6b9775e4c5f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Atheism - An Australian Perspective [Part 1 of 3]</title><published>2009-04-24T17:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T18:19:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/9Y6vI2MVLZI/atheism-australian-perspective-part-1.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8513176334554375162/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8513176334554375162" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/atheism-australian-perspective-part-1.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">See below&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/OTInM9ZXhZ8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-8513176334554375162?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

His efforts are said to have led to six years of warfare that have claimed the lives of 47 people in New Guinea.  Rhonda Roland Shearer’s &lt;a href="http://www.stinkyjournalism.org/latest-journalism-news-updates-149.php"&gt;very long blog&lt;/a&gt; at StinkyJournalism.org provides more details. There’s a connection to Language Log because Shearer asked linguist Douglas Biber to assess whether the long, numerous, and allegedly direct quotations in Diamond’s article were actually spoken language or whether they were written language modified to look like direct quotes. Biber is an expert on measuring the differences between written and spoken language, so it was prudent for Shearer to seek his help with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpus_linguistics"&gt;corpus linguistics&lt;/a&gt; to help resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Biber’s first impression was that the quotations were academic writing rather than speech, but he wanted to analyze them further, which he did, basing his results on a huge data base of spoken and written English, The Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English. Following are excerpts from Biber’s report to Shearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;Over the last 25 years, a research approach has been developed for the empirical analysis of such grammatical characteristics. Referred to as ‘corpus linguistics’, the approach is based on the analysis of very large collections of natural texts from thousands of individual speakers and writers. Computer programs aid the analyses, which result in descriptions of the grammatical features that are especially frequent, features that are typical, and features that rarely occur. In addition, by comparing corpora with different kinds of texts, it is possible to contrast the grammatical characteristics that are usually found in conversation to those usually found in academic writing (or any other spoken or written varieties).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The most comprehensive grammatical description of English undertaken from this perspective is the 1,200-page Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (LGSWE; Biber et al. 1999). The research for that project is based on analysis of a very large corpus that represents four major varieties: conversation, fiction writing, newspaper writing, and academic writing. For example, the sub-corpus for conversation includes c. 6.4 million words, produced by thousands of speakers. The sub-corpus for academic writing includes 5.3 million words from 408 different texts. Computational / quantitative analyses of these corpora allow us to make strong generalizations about the grammatical characteristics that are frequent or rare in conversation, contrasted with the features that are frequent/rare in academic writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Biber explained that he carried out a 3-way comparison:&lt;br&gt;
1. a quantitative analysis of the grammatical characteristics of Diamond’s quotes [i.e., the quotations attributed to Wemp as his spoken words in the 4/21/08 New Yorker article]&lt;br&gt;
2. a quantitative grammatical analysis of Wemp’s actual speech [verbatim transcripts of speech produced by Wemp collected by Shearer] and&lt;br&gt;
3. the research findings from the LGSWE [large-scale corpus analysis of conversation and academic writing].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biber then continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;Taken together, the linguistic analyses indicate that it is extremely unlikely that The New Yorker quotations are accurate verbatim representations of language that originated in speech. To put it simply, normal people do not talk using the grammatical structures represented in these quotations. However, these quotations do include several grammatical structures found commonly in academic writing, suggesting that the quotations were produced in writing rather than being transcribed from speech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;He gives some examples:&lt;br&gt;
Adjective and/but adjective (e.g., tall and handsome) was 100 times more frequent in Diamond quotes than in speech.&lt;br&gt;
Preposition + Relative pronoun (e.g., each battle in which we succeeded in killing an Ombal) was 100 times more frequent in Diamond quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Biber concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;These comparisons show the magnitude of the discrepancies between the grammatical style of normal conversation contrasted with the grammatical style of the Diamond quotes. To find one of these grammatical features in a normal conversation is noteworthy. To find repeated use of this large constellation of features in actual spoken discourse, some of them occurring c. 100 times more often than in normal conversation, is extremely unlikely. In contrast, these are all features that are typical of academic writing, suggesting that they have their origin in writing rather than actual speech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other corpus studies (e.g., the book University Language; Biber 2006) have shown that these same features are rare and exceptional in even academic speech, including university lectures. In contrast, what we find in the Diamond quotes is the pervasive use of a suite of grammatical constructions, which are all rare in conversation but common in formal writing. This constellation of grammatical characteristics is also strikingly different from the grammatical style of the verbatim transcripts of speech produced by DW [Daniel Wemp]. In sum, the analysis strongly indicates that the Diamond quotes are much more like discourse that was produced in writing, reflecting the typical grammatical features of formal academic prose, rather than verbatim representations of language that was produced in speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It will be interesting to see what The New Yorker’s lawyers will be able to do with Biber’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/strong&gt; is this Monday, and we have webcomic artists Jeffrey Rowland of Overcompensating &amp;amp; Wigu and Jon Rosenberg of Goats! It is going to rock so hard you will require extra socks. Details at &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Boston Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; or RSVP on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/event.php?eid=156729695246&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Double Feature podcast is fun and about movies and hosted by skeptics, and they just posted a new episode in which I appear to chat a bit about Loose Change! It was plenty of fun – &lt;a href="http://doublefeatureshow.com/?e=hard-rock-zombies-loose-change"&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading article penned by &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/23/jim-carrey-loves-the-pro-disease-movement/"&gt;Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt;, and knowing that leading antivaxxers David Kirby and RFK Jr. also write for HuffPo, I was expecting to see things I wouldn’t be terribly happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/jenny-mccarthys-autism-cr_b_190486.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was just posted supporting Jenny McCarthy and her campaign, which, if successful, will bring back measles and polio to our children. Read it if you dare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so transparently antiscience that I had to know who wrote it, and what do I see? &amp;quot;Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald&amp;quot;. Oh great, I thought. A doctor. So what’s her specialty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/#blogger_bio"&gt;click her bio&lt;/a&gt;! It says she’s &amp;quot;a licensed acupuncturist, certified clinical nutritionist, and a homeopath. She has a Master’s Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Doctorate in Homeopathic Medicine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ka&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLAM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. When I read that my brain asploded&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#homeofootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am embarrassed I ever wrote anything for HuffPo, which is now a cesspool of misleading misinformation. Funny though; I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get people asking me &amp;quot;What’s the harm in believing in things that aren’t real?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net"&gt;What’s the harm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles (with possibility of encephalitis and permanent brain damage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death&lt;/em&gt;. That’s the harm. The antivax movement, the people who promote homeopathic water, the people who want you to poke you with needles… they are peddling nonsense &lt;em&gt;that doesn’t work&lt;/em&gt;. And worse, when they convince someone that their fantasy is correct and the entire scientific and medical establishment is wrong, that person will be denied treatment that may actually do some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks may honestly care about others, and may be honestly trying to help. I’m sure that’s the case for Fitzgerald, who seems sincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sincerity doesn’t make you right. And in the case of the antivaxxers it can make you — and everyone else — sick. Very sick indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="homeofootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I keep wondering how you get a doctorate in homeopathy. Maybe the less you study the more powerful your learning is. Or you could grind up the people who passed the exams the year before, mix one molecule of them with water, and drink up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-medpot24-2009apr24,0,1972910.story"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt;, the sentencing has been pushed back until June 11th. Maybe some sanity will settle out by then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randi takes a different tone this time as a recent letter has shown that his adopted country is sometimes less than compassionate. Are politics more important than people? Maybe, but it shouldn't be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Randi -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand this:  I heartily endorse and accept marijuana use for medical purposes; research has clearly shown that it works efficiently in that role, and brings comfort and relief to the suffering.  As a result of this stated conditional acceptance, I have been approached by those who advocate general use of the substance on the same level that tobacco enjoys.  Generally, this makes sense to me, except that if its use were to bring with it the same dreadful health penalties that accompany tobacco, I would be reluctant to accept that.  I am not a drug user, I have never even been inebriated.  That is my personal choice, and I feel that other persons should also enjoy freedom of choice, even if taxes are imposed on that freedom in order to legislate it; I don’t want out-of-control drivers threatening my safety, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

Somehow, you've decided that the word of two celebrities whose popularity averages out to C-list (at best) trumps the mountains upon mountains of actual scientific evidence from actual scientists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can hear the cries now: "but Jenny and Jim &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; scientists on their side!" Yes, and so do the flat-Earthers, the Creationists, and (to co-opt the antivax crowd's favorite example) the tobacco companies. What Jenny and Jim and Generation Rescue and Age of Autism and the other pro-disease groups &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; have is anything resembling a preponderance of evidence to support their hypotheses. They don't even have enough evidence to make their hypothesis seem like a worthwhile and plausible research avenue. After the MMR/Autism link was demonstrated to be the result of an interest-conflicted researcher gaming the data from small poorly-controlled studies using analysis from a compromised lab, the antivax crowd changed the hypothesis--now the connection was proposed to be the mercury in thimerosal, not the measles virus in MMR. So the real scientists rolled up their sleeves again, the legal process bent over backwards to accommodate the antivaxxers' suspicions, and thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines while scientists tested the hypothesis. Study after study, data set after data set, have refuted the purported link between thimerosal and autism, and oh by the way, there's no proposed mechanism for such a link anyway, given what we already know about how ethylmercury compounds like thimerosal interact with the body. Now the antivaxxers have shifted the goalposts again, retreating to that refuge of scoundrels and charlatans, the vague and unscientific notion of "toxins." They throw out terms designed to baffle and frighten the chemistry-illiterate public and intentionally fail to understand the important role of dosage in determining a substance's toxicity. And despite this failure to comprehend basic things like measurement, they augment this toxin gambit with a mantra of "too many, too soon." Yes, curse those doctors for giving our children too many attenuated viruses and viral protein fragments before they can be exposed to the real things. I mean, surely nature, which is &lt;a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1751122"&gt;fluffy and nice and clean and wonderful to all living things&lt;/a&gt; would be much more forgiving with its &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;exposure schedule&lt;/a&gt;. How well we remember those halcyon days of tooth enamel-destroying fevers and iron lungs. If it weren't for the fact that "toxins" is sufficiently vague and untestable and unfalsifiable as a complaint--so much so that it's ubiquitous among woo-woo garbage--I would expect the next antivax meme to be about the "energy" of the vaccines causing autism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This constant goalpost-shifting is not a hallmark of a scientific hypothesis. It's not the sign of rational examination of claims or a desire to actually determine whether or not one's convictions are true. It's the tactic of the true believer, the unsinkable rubber ducks whose certainty insulates their beliefs from criticism, evidence, and any harsh contact with reality. Good science has invalidated each of their hypotheses in turn, demonstrating that their proposed causal link is borne out of fallacious post-hoc thinking and unscientific ideology. The scientific method is to abandon mistaken hypotheses, not to make them vaguer and less prone to falsification until they lack any explanatory power at all. This is what the antivax crowd has done; this is emphatically not scientific. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenny McCarthy trusts her "mommy instinct" and her Google-based research, but neither of these are reliable sources of truth. The Internet is wonderful in that it gives everyone a voice, and terrible in that it lacks any quality control or fact-checking requirement. "Mommy instincts" are great for skinned knees and stormy nights, but they aren't reliable sources of truth--just ask any geeky kid whose mom says he's the handsomest boy in his school, or any mom who thinks her college-bound daughter is pure and virginal as the driven snow. If "mommy instinct" were as reliable as Jenny seems to think, then there would be no need for pediatricians. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she is a celebrity, and so is her boyfriend, and so they have the means and prestige to promote their arrogant, dangerous ignorance to a humongous audience of credulous people, and they are given equal standing with actual scientists, their ignorance pitted against actual evidence as though the two had similar claims to the truth. I'm all for celebrities having and sharing their opinions; what they shouldn't be doing (and what our media shouldn't be complicit in allowing them to do) is pretending that their SAG memberships make them authorities on anything more complicated than method acting. I applaud celebrities like Amanda Peet for standing up and giving the side of reason and science a voice, but I deplore a system and a society where the side with the most famous people on it is commonly believed to be the side with the truth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So go ahead, put your kids at risk for dozens of debilitating, easily preventable diseases by putting your trust in this asshole:&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SfIEOpQb0bI/AAAAAAAAA9w/uOMfVV7HJUw/s1600-h/batman-still01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:214px;height:320px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SfIEOpQb0bI/AAAAAAAAA9w/uOMfVV7HJUw/s320/batman-still01.jpg" border="0" alt="That&amp;#39;s right, Batman fucking Forever." title="That&amp;#39;s right, Batman fucking Forever." vspace="2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me, I'll stick to science.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1699606082673942540?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240600074886"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1367">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/279f2230387dd969</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Changing Times"/><title type="html">Maureen Dowd interviews Alexander Graham Bell</title><published>2009-04-24T19:04:01Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T19:04:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1367" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;… as &lt;a href="http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2009/04/ms-dowd-interviews-the-inventor-of-the-telephone.html"&gt;translated by Nancy Friedman&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/opinion/22dowd.html"&gt;original MoDonese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240598728001"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7572519976603683150">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95f5f9b56946fe39</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Can watery asteroids explain why life is 'left-handed'?</title><published>2009-04-24T18:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-25T22:55:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/can-watery-asteroids-explain-why-life.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7572519976603683150/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7572519976603683150" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> It&amp;#39;s time to re-visit the so-called &amp;quot;racemization&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chirality&amp;quot; problem.

I have been looking for good views of the planet from space.  In fact, two nights ago my TV satellite provider Dish Network launched the Earth Channel, with a 24/7 view of the earth from the EchoStar 11 satellite.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/earth1.gif" title="earth1.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/earth1.gif" width="300" alt="earth1.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDvaU-GyIYE"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; with a compressed 24 hour series of stills taken from the camera.  At one point you see the moon passing behind the earth.  Of course since it’s a TV satellite, it’s geosynchronous and you’ll only ever see the western hemisphere.  As far as I can tell, though, you cannot get it online anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one is pretty cool.  Even though the image is not very sharp, you can actually &lt;a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/space/webcam.htm"&gt;control a little web cam&lt;/a&gt; on a the Tate satellite, in polar orbit 400 km above the earth…  Add a focus button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot seem to get &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html?param=station"&gt;NASA’s ISS webcam stream&lt;/a&gt; to work.  Darn.  Too popular?  Not Mac compatible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Al Gore’s 1990’s vision of an Earth-viewing satellite, originally called Triana, and later renamed DSCOVR, &lt;a href="http://space.skyrocket.de/index_frame.htm?http://www.skyrocket.de/space/doc_sdat/triana.htm"&gt;sits in storage at Goddard&lt;/a&gt;, having been built but cancelled in 2006.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, it appeared for some time that a similar fate awaited Nobel Prize winner Sam Ting’s &lt;a href="http://ams.cern.ch/"&gt;Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer&lt;/a&gt;, designed to search for antimatter (antihelium nuclei, in fact) and other things in space.  Construction of the $1.5 billion satellite was completed, and it awaits launch at CERN.  An additional, final Space Shuttle mission, STS-134, was added to the 2010 NASA schedule.  It was authorized by Congress in the fall but I am not sure if funding has been appropriated yet.  (My money is on Sam Ting, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, where are the cool views of our planet from space?  &lt;/p&gt;

A new &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/04232009/news/regionalnews/tamper_with_marriage__were_in_big_troubl_165728.htm"&gt;archbishop has tried to use biology to argue for his archaic moral position&lt;/a&gt;, and I just want to slap him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archbishop Timothy Dolan yesterday said advocates of gay marriage "are asking for trouble," arguing that traditional, one-man/one-woman marriage is rooted in people's moral DNA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"There's an in-built code of right and wrong that's embedded in the human DNA," Dolan told The Post in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview, a week after becoming the New York Archdiocese's new leader.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Hard-wired into us is a dictionary, and the dictionary defines marriage as between one man, one woman for life, please God, leading to the procreation of human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every word an ignorant lie. There is no genetic basis for a moral code except, perhaps, in the broadest sense of intrinsic rewards for social behavior — Catholicism is not biologically heritable. There is nothing in us that hardwires simplistic monogamy — human cultures have had a wide range of different patterns of sexual behavior. And gay people do not have desires in defiance of their biological impulses, but as consequences of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, well, I&amp;#39;m sure Timmy Dolan will go far in the Catholic hierarchy — it doesn&amp;#39;t reward intelligence or knowledge, and he&amp;#39;s got neither.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/moral_dna.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/iSc5BUDgB5E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240592657119"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9197">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8adc55b15ea2bb8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="protest"/><category term="wine"/><title type="html">Révolte des Vignerons</title><published>2009-04-24T16:35:40Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T16:35:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/HYeDil7avG0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/revolte-des-vignerons/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Levitt's cheap wine advocacy may have met its match.

Over the ocean, the typical droplet size is much smaller in ship exhaust than in the natural cloud cover, producing different reflectivity, leading to high contrast white ship trails.  As Cliff discusses, you can imagine the interest that national security agencies might have in this effect….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(EDIT: Actually, it turns out that contrails are primarily due to vapor released during combustion, not nucleation, so the processes are somewhat different.)&lt;/p&gt;

They create two gaps, one on each side. But it is often used because it pithily exposes the intellectual buffoonery of those evolution deniers (aka creationists) who deny common descent. What is a “gap;” how big does it have to be to call into question common decent; or rather how small do the gaps have to shrink before creationists will accept common descent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest outright lie in the creationist camp, still frequently parroted, is that there is a lack of transitional fossils in the fossil record. That is why it is important to showcase to the public the steady stream of beautiful transitional fossils that are being added to our already copious fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent issue of &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7241/full/nature07985.html"&gt;Nature, scientist present&lt;/a&gt; yet another pesky gap filled in with a transitional fossil, this one an early pinniped - which includes seals, sealions, and walruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossil is between 20-24 million years old and is dubbed &lt;em&gt;Puijila darwini. &lt;/em&gt;Here is the technical description from the Nature article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new taxon retains a long tail and the proportions of its fore- and hindlimbs are more similar to those of modern terrestrial carnivores than to modern pinnipeds. Morphological traits indicative of semi-aquatic adaptation include a forelimb with a prominent deltopectoral ridge on the humerus, a posterodorsally expanded scapula, a pelvis with relatively short ilium, a shortened femur and flattened phalanges, suggestive of webbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the creature was able to walk on land, was likely a carnivore, but had some early adaptations to the water, such as webbed feat. Think of an otter (it was 110 cm long) with a long tale and the teeth of a dog.  The earliest pinniped fossils come from 20-28 million years ago, about the same time as this fossil, and already have fully developed flippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fossil suggests answers to several unknowns - what evolutionary path did pinnipeds take, what are their closest relatives, and where greographically did their evolution take place? This fossil suggests they evolved in the fresh waters of the arctic, as opposed to the the northwestern US, where the earliest pinniped fossils were found. This one fossil does not settle this last question, but does suggest the arctic as a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can anticipate the standard creationist denial. They will argue that this fossil cannot be a direct ancestor to pinnipeds because it is as old, and not older, than the earliest pinniped fossils with fully formed flippers.  This is true, as the authors of the Nature article readily state. Most fossils will not be direct ancestors to living descendants. This is because evolutionary relationships are bushy - they are not a ladder of linear progression. A randomly discovered fossil is therefore likely to be on a side branch, not one that lead directly to species that happen to be extant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of Archaeopteryx - the transitional species between small theropod dinosaurs and modern birds. Archaeopteryx is almost certainly not on the main line that lead to birds. But it does show that in the right time and place there were feathered dinosaurs that had half reptilian and half bird-like morphology. Evolutionary theory also predicted that we would find more - and we have, in spades. There is now a fairly full assortment of feathered dinosaurs at different stages of evolution from dinosaurs to birds, filling in the gaps on either side of archaeopteryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same was true of Ambulocetus, the walking whale. This one species is clearly transitional from terrestrial mammals to whales, but was also adapted to it current niche. It didn’t “know” that its clade was evolving toward whalenss, it was just adapted to its current lifestyle. We can only put it into perspective today - as a transitional species, because we know what some of its ancestors became. And, as with Archaeopteryx, we have since found numerous other fossils filling in the gaps on either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also look at Australopithecus robustus. This was not the first extinct hominid discovered, but let us say this was the only fossil homonid we had. It is clearly transitional between humans and modern apes, suggesting that we share a common ancestor. But it is also clearly not a direct ancestor of modern humans. It sits on an evolutionary branch that exists in the morphological space between humans and chimpanzees, but is not on the branch that leads directly to modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality we have many homonid fossil species, and we have a pretty good idea of those whose direct ancestors are modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists rhetoric is often clueless about the nature of speciation. They argue as if they think that one species turns into another, but ignore the fact that one species can turn into two or more through speciation - separated populations taking different paths. They are therefore puzzled that (taking this new fossil for example) a slightly older fossil can look more like modern pinnipeds than this new fossil. They ignore the fact that the definition of “modern” or “advanced” is relative - in this case relative to modern pinnipeds. When one common ancestor species splits into two, one of which leads to modern pinnipeds and the other does not, the ones on their way to becomming modern pinnipeds will look more like their modern descendants than those on the branch that did not evolve in that direction. So species on the side branch (again, “side” relative to the line that lead to extant species), may retain features that are “primitive” in the extant line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further clarify this point (because it is so often confused by creationists), evolution predicts that we will find fossils that are morphologically roughly transitional between extant species with a common ancestor and at a time and place in the past where this evolution was taking place. But it does not predict a strict linear sequence because speciation creates a complex and bushy picture of evolutoinary relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what has happened, and is happening, in each of the examples I gave and many others, is that as more and more fossil are found they fit nicely into a reasonable tree of relatedness, temporally and morphologically. Evolution predicts that something like &lt;em&gt;Puijila darwini &lt;/em&gt;had to exist, and at about the age that it is. Creationism does not. It further predicts that we will find more fossils that flesh out pinniped evolution even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation “scientist” Duane Gish famously quipped in his many debates with scientists that the notion of terrestrial mammals evolving into whales was like a cow taking to the water, a strategy he characterized as an “utter” failure. Nice pun, but intellectually vacuous. He should have been thinking of otters, not utters. There are already known many living species with various degrees of adaptation to aquatic life. Otters and beavers are comfortable on land, but are good swimmers.  Seals and sealions are able to awkwardly shuffle about on land, but are even more adpated to the sea, with flippers instead of feet. Manatees are similar to walruses, but are one more notch further adapted to the sea and lost their ability to amble out onto land. And whales are fully adapated to aquatic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These creatures do not represent and evolutionary sequence, but they do show a plausible sequence of variable degrees of adaptation to the water. And we have been finding fossil species that show a similar sequence, with walking whales and now walking seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossil evidence for common descent is so stunning in its confirmation of evolutionary theory, that I cannot help wonder about the cognitive dissonance it creates in any creationist even modestly familiar with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

I was interviewed extensively for it, and contributed to the ideas and some of the script, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3469056433/sizes/l/in/set-72157617130394057/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3499/3469056433_ca81208466_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take explosives seriously, folks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We filmed the clips I was in last year, in November and December. This involved a helicopter ride over Niagara Falls, and going to Phoenix, Arizona to detonate explosives and &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/naked-science/3899/Overview#tab-Photos/3"&gt;shoot guns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a lot of pictures; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/sets/72157617130394057/"&gt;they’re posted on Flickr&lt;/a&gt; for your enjoyment. It includes people shooting guns, aerial views of Niagara Falls, and an unfortunate shot of an injury I sustained due to holding a .38 pistol the wrong way. Watch out for powder burns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took quite a bit of video, so &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWgb64PvcKE"&gt;here’s a little taste&lt;/a&gt; of what it’s like to film a documentary on destroying a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/cWgb64PvcKE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, our explosives and gun expert was &lt;a href="http://www.cfxaz.com/"&gt;Cory Starr&lt;/a&gt;, who was fun to work with. His assistant &lt;a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewPicture&amp;amp;friendID=41000079&amp;amp;albumId=2513017"&gt;Cortney McLeod&lt;/a&gt; is in there too. The director of the clips (with the English accent) is Lorne Townend, and assistant producer &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=750280584"&gt;Nicola Tremain&lt;/a&gt; organized all the logistics of the shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I’ll add something funny to me. I’ve known astronomer &lt;a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~durda/"&gt;Dan Durda&lt;/a&gt; since we were undergrads together at Michigan. We both write and both do a lot of documentaries, but in more than two decades this is the first time we’ve been in a show together! Even though we weren’t together for filming, that was still cool to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also doing two more documentary interviews in the coming weeks, including working with Lorne again, so expect to hear more about stuff like this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240590156528"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_freedom_aac_when_and_where_its_needed">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9bdd58503c4a1365</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">New Freedom: AAC When and Where It's Needed</title><published>2009-04-24T16:21:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T16:21:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_freedom_aac_when_and_where_its_needed" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3004/2713811844_307b1f30f4_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3004/2713811844_307b1f30f4_m.jpg" alt="a communication disc in a field under a blue sky" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So.  I got my announcement that &lt;a href="http://proloquo2go.com"&gt;Proloquo2Go&lt;/a&gt; is now available in the iTunes store Wednesday morning.  Several hours later my atlas-camera-alarm-emergency phone-sms device-Internet anywhere-notepad-schedule-calendar-and general other-half-of-my-brains iPhone had also become a shiny new AAC device.  I spent the afternoon exploring, reprogramming, being excited, and developing a wish-list of features I'd like to see in a next version.  I truly, truly am not trying to sell specific products here on this blog--I write about this because it's what I use, what I have hands-on experience with in day to day life.  But the topics that come up for me with the specific devices I use do, I hope, point out some concepts that are more global in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this case, as I become ever more giddy about the new freedom I will have from the new device, the idea of advances in &lt;a href="http://www.washington.edu/accessit/articles?109"&gt;assistive technology&lt;/a&gt; meaning new freedom is not restricted to any one specific piece of technology, to any one individual person (can think even as broadly as changes in wheelchair design over the past 50 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when the limits of my communication were defined by specific people, specific topics, and so many random factors it might as well have been star alignments.  I remember too the freedom that came with starting to use alternative communication means, and having my world open, limits became defined instead by paper and pen, by portability, battery power and flat surfaces.  My options opened; a new world opened.  Limits redefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as technology becomes even better suited to match my specific needs, my limits are being redefined again--increased portability, hours and hours of battery life, the ability to communicate while moving, walking, without a screen between me and my conversation partners--and things I haven't discovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up before computers even existed in people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a computer I can hold in one hand and operate with a single finger gives me the freedom to communicate with others no matter where I am, no matter when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just... well, &lt;em&gt;neat&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=19327&amp;amp;top=10825&amp;amp;deep=2&amp;amp;trail=22"&gt;a lot of AAC solutions&lt;/a&gt; out there.  Even though a solution might be totally different from mine for others, finding a good match between a particular AAC solution and an individual's personality, abilities, and usage needs can be a big step in redefining individual limits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240589916279"><id gr:original-id="532 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f2ce5ab586efdc2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="BPSDB" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/112"/><category term="homeopathy" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/256"/><category term="Jeremy Sherr" scheme="http://www.layscience.net/taxonomy/term/559"/><title type="html">In which Jeremy Sherr amusingly responds to some questions</title><published>2009-04-24T13:05:28Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T13:05:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/532" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[bpsdb]&lt;/b&gt; A little while ago, Jeremy Sherr was interviewed on an online video-cast about homeopathy. Viewers - all seventy of them - were invited to ask questions, posing them in a forum that had been set up for the event. Since I've been following &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/467"&gt;Sherr's activities recently&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I'd take the opportunity to ask a couple, but they weren't answered, and after a while I forgot about them. Then &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com"&gt;Gimpy e-mailed me to say that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lecanardnoir"&gt;@lecanardnoir&lt;/a&gt; had spotted some answers being posted, and the answers are rather amusing, and more than a little disturbing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://homeopathyworldcommunity.com/forum/topics/question-for-jeremy"&gt;first question I asked&lt;/a&gt; referred to a comment he made on his blog: &lt;i&gt;"I have little interest in the many new paths of homoeopathy that have addressed Aids and the epidemic."&lt;/i&gt; Naturally I can't refer you to this, since Sherr decided to delete his posts after they were heavily criticised. At any rate, it was rather an odd thing to say, and I was curious to know more about it. Here is Jeremy's reply (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#990000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It is just not for me. I respect anyone who is trying to help the situation holistically and especially with homoeopathy. But my way is the classical way as described by Hahnemann. And the first thing one must know about treating epidemics according to Hahnemann is not to have any prior notions, ideas or theories (par 100). &lt;u&gt;I therefore actively avoid other peoples' findings that are not based on the classical way&lt;/u&gt;, because I would rather find out for myself. By the classical way I mean that if anyone has seen 100 or more cases, sifted out the pure AIDS symptoms and sorted out the most essential ones, and then worked the case As If One Person (par 102), I would be very interested in that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#990000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am sure a great many homoeopathic methods 'work', but that is not my only criteria".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm truly speechless at the sheer irresponsible wild-eyed lunacy of this statement. Yes, he really did say that: &lt;i&gt;"I therefore actively avoid other peoples' findings that are not based on the classical way."&lt;/i&gt; This is a man who is trying to set up homeopathic AIDS clinics in Tanzania stating that he ignores research produced by other homeopaths, and that he doesn't care if what they produce works or not because he would &lt;i&gt;"rather find out for myself"&lt;/i&gt; and apparently &lt;i&gt;"working isn't everything"&lt;/i&gt; (paraphrasing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying in vain how to make the stupidity of these words any clearer, but I can't. It astonishes me that anyone can not see how utterly irresponsible this attitude is. The job of a doctor is to treat people, and the only thing that matters is the efficacy of the treatment. To reject a potential cure for AIDS because it doesn't suit your particular style of homeopathy is just inconceivable. What kind of mind produces this nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering that to some degree, and equally remarkable, is his response to my second question, in which I commented on the "hostility" he had received from some bloggers, and asked if he had any advice on "how we should deal with these sorts of people". This reply is almost &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/43"&gt;Obi-like&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#990000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;u&gt;From my enquiries these blogs actually have very little traffic going through them. Most of the traffic is actually from homoeopaths&lt;/u&gt;, and a close group of the bloggers’ friends swimming around in their own swill. My advice is to ignore, ignore, ignore. Don't even visit these pages, and if you do never use links or Google to get there, because that just ups their Google rating. There is no chance of convincing or influencing them, &lt;u&gt;especially because some are supported by powerful bodies&lt;/u&gt;. And &lt;u&gt;they are experts at distorting anything you say&lt;/u&gt;. Just forget them, or if you want, write your own blog with your opinions, and make sure not to put links to them in it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#990000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;It might help to imagine these bloggers as a group of noisy naughty adolescent kids playing outside your window. &lt;u&gt;Their games have meaning for themselves only.&lt;/u&gt; Probably not wise to get into an argument with them, easier to close the window and get on with your work."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Sherr has degenerated into pure fantasy, and the claims made are just bizarre. I don't know where Jeremy's "enquiries" took him, but badscience.net is one of the &lt;a href="http://www.wikio.co.uk/blogs/top"&gt;top blogs in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, while layscience.net has been visited &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/stats/index.html"&gt;over 166,000 times in April already&lt;/a&gt;, representing around 25,000 unique people from around the world. Jeremy's video interview attracted 70 viewers. And one of those was me, with several other badscience.net forum denizens in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally deluded are the dark conspiracy theories about funding by "powerful bodies." This blog and the BPSDB server currenly cost me around £360 per year to run, and when I install BPSDB v3.0 soon, that will rise to nearly £600. Against that, I have one advertising contract for around a hundred quid a year. I would dearly love to know where I'm supposed to be picking up these Big Pharm cheques from, but they'd probably refuse me since I've happily savaged pharmaceutical firms before. I write about these issues because I find them interesting, and I care passionately about them, not because I make money from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me neatly to this gem: &lt;i&gt;"Their games have meaning for themselves only."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't "games". These are people who see the activities of people like Sherr and find them disgusting. These are people who, when they see somebody without medical training setting up AIDS clinics in Africa, are deeply concerned. These are people who, when they see that person "treating" Africans while happily explaining that they refuse to even read information about potential cures that don't fit their particular style, are disgusted. Public health is not a game, nor is it primarily an opportunity for personal development, it is an ongoing battle to get the right treatments to people, and even if you believe that homeopathy works, Jeremy Sherr's cavalier attitude to not just modern medicine but the findings of other homeopaths, simply cannot be acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

We understand his need to save face with the base. But there’s still work to do if Gordon is serious about reforming extremist anti-vaccine rhetoric, and this is a nice start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon, who has advised Jenny McCarthy on matters medical and scientific, is well positioned to become a change agent in the autism wars.  As a physician he swore to “never do harm to anyone”,  and what better place to start than debunking some of the destructive myths at the heart of the anti-vaccine movement. A few that come to mind are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no anti-freeze, ether, or aborted fetal tissue in vaccines, and formaldehyde is a natural by-product of single carbon metabolism. “Green vaccines” is a deceptive marketing pitch with no practical application in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for an autism epidemic is paper thin, and most of today’s children with ASDs would have received a different diagnosis, or no label at all, prior to 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks of serious adverse reactions, which are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific method is the best way that we have to separate nonsense from fact. And though imperfectly applied, it is far more reliable than talk show wisdom or diagnosis by celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Don't get me wrong, I had an enormous amount of fun writing my commentary on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;Fire Marshal Bill's attempt to explain vaccine/autism pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. It was a hoot, if I do say so myself, but it depresses me that writing such posts is so necessary so often. Fortunately, it's Friday, and you know what that means (well, at least some of the time, anyway). That's right, it's time for some woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, it's not just any woo. In fact, it's woo that relates to my area of expertise. As you may recall, I do a lot of breast cancer surgery, and I run a lab the focus of whose research is breast cancer. And what woo it is! it's a shame that it may now be off the market. Well, not really, and it's not even clear to me that it is off the market. After all, you can still buy Airborne, even though the company was fined millions for making exaggerated and false advertising claims. I still occasionally see Enzyte "male enhancement" commercials even though the company that makes Enzyte was similarly fined big time and its CEO is facing a prison term. So, I'm not surprised that I'm still seeing the website for the &lt;a href="http://intimatehealth.net/b.html"&gt;Brassage&lt;/a&gt; pushing the same woo. What is the Brassage, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's serious, serious woo. Indeed, it claims to be able to "stimulate" lymphatic flow in the breasts and thereby--well, why don't you take a guess what "stimulation" of lymphatic flow in the breasts will do, ignoring for the moment that a bra isn't going to stimulate lymphatic flow in the breasts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_not_just_a_b.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_not_just_a_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/0U320mYgKwo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240585650879"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/friday-round-up-2/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e6e552bd7aa8ae8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skeptics"/><category term="RC Forum"/><title type="html">Friday round-up</title><published>2009-04-24T15:07:20Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T15:07:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/friday-round-up-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They knew all along?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A recent story in NYT: '&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html?_r=1&amp;amp;emc=eta1"&gt;Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate&lt;/a&gt;' has caught our attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://throbgoblins.blogspot.com/2009/04/creative-differences.html"&gt;Marc Roberts'&lt;/a&gt; take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2fgn3xZDtkI/SfMMkf8OftI/AAAAAAAACkc/O352yM9lenY/s1600-h/ArtSTRIP(MINI)(web).jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2fgn3xZDtkI/SfMMkf8OftI/AAAAAAAACkc/O352yM9lenY/s400/ArtSTRIP(MINI)(web).jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latest skeptical song from Singer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the annual &lt;a href="http://www.egu.eu/home.html"&gt;European Geophysical Union&lt;/a&gt; (EGU)'s &lt;a href="http://www.egu.eu/news/news/article/10/general-asse.html"&gt;general assembly&lt;/a&gt; was held in Vienna. Friday afternoon, I went to one of the conference&amp;#39;s last talks to learn about the latest news from the climate skeptics (have to keep an open mind…). It was probably the talk with the smallest audience in the whole conference (see the photo, but note there were a couple of individuals who were not captured by camera), despite an unusually long slot (30 min) allocation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/singer.jpg" title="singer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/singer.thumbnail.jpg" alt="singer.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And not much news, I'm afraid, apart from that SEPP plans to release it's &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/not-the-ipcc-nipcc-report/"&gt;NIPCC&lt;/a&gt;'09 in May. I understand it will be a thick report (800 pages?). The main messages were (a) that GHGs were unimportant - allegedlly supported by &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117857349/abstract"&gt;Douglass et al. (2007)&lt;/a&gt;, and (b) solar activity was the main reason for the recent global warming and the mechanism involved &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/cosmic-rays-don%e2%80%99t-die-so-easily/"&gt;galactic cosmic rays (GCR)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Singer how he could explain the most recent warming when there is &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/recent-warming-but-no-trend-in-galactic-cosmic-rays/"&gt;no trend&lt;/a&gt; in the GCR-flux or other indices of solar activity since 1952. He countered by saying he was glad I asked him this question, and announced that he had done his thesis exactly on the topic solar wind and GCRs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to answer that I had written a book about solar activity and climate, and I repeated my question. He could not answer in the end - other than saying that we have to look at the data. I told him that we already have looked at the data (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2002/2001JA000507.shtml"&gt;Richardsson et al 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2005GL023621.shtml"&gt;Benestad, 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/proceedings_a/rspa20071880.pdf"&gt;Lockwood &amp;amp; Frohlich, 2007&lt;/a&gt;), so I recommended him to read up on RC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is Mr. SETI…the Senior Astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. He is the host for the SETI Institute’s excellent weekly radio program and podcast “Are We Alone?”. He is also an author; most recently of: &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Confessions of an Alien Hunter&lt;/a&gt;: A Scientist’s Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth recently had a very intriguing OP-ED in the New York Times called &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/opinion/14shostak.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;Boldly Going Nowhere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:282px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/seth1.jpg" alt="I COULDNT RESIST THIS PIC OF SETH" width="272" height="320"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I COULDN&amp;quot;T RESIST THIS PIC OF SETH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opens with:&lt;br&gt;
“It’s a birthright proffered by science and prophesied by “Star Trek,” “Battlestar Galactica” and a thousand other space operas: We’re destined to go to the stars. Our descendants will spread beyond this nondescript solar system and seek adventure and bumpy-headed pals in the stellar realms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem though is that this is a “pipe-dream” as Seth calls it. The distances to other solar systems are so immense that even our adjectives aren’t up to the task. Our technology as well has similar failings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical combustion rockets can get to the moon in days and mars in months but a journey to the sun’s closest stellar companion, Proxima Centauri, would take 800 or so centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be better than our best chemical rockets which can go maybe 10 miles per second. Ion Beam probes are a relatively new technology which have flown in space with great results. They accelerate charged particles out the back of the ship, slowly accelerating it to respectable speeds of even  50 miles per second. Nuclear powered craft are another near-term technology that could probably go 20 times faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undeniably wicked fast but still it would take many (even super-sized) lifetimes to get people to another star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we need some really exotic technology to get to other suns in a manageable timeframe. Something like worm holes or antimatter drives. Now I won’t go into detail about the feasibility of these methods, suffice it to say we won’t be seeing this tech anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this tech arrives, Seth’s idea is to forget the humans entirely.  Instead of sending them to other solar systems, send the solar systems back to us using telepresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telepresence is a rapidly improving technology that essentially floods your senses with information to create the convincing illusion that you’re at another real location. You may think that this is just an immersive virtual reality and it is true that they are very similar and use much of the same technology. The key functional difference though is that with telepresence the “thing” at the other end of the line is a real environment and not a wholly computer-generated one. This has been done with the hi-res data we’ve collected from Mars. Have any of you seen any of the Mars Imax movies? They’re incredible. They can really make you feel like your there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea then, and I love this idea, is to resurrect and update NASA’s &lt;a href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3ap.html"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; of nuclear-powered rockets and use this technology to send micro-bots into deep space at about 1/10th the speed of light. With no humans to take care of and bring home, these probes can be very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:670px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/Nasa-NukeEngine1.jpg" alt="FROM NASA NUCLEAR ENGINE ARCHIVE" width="660" height="310"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FROM NASA NUCLEAR ENGINE ARCHIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, depending on the financing and international cooperation, we could conceivably launch these probes before the end of this century which means we could have images and other information from the nearest known planetary system, Epsilon Eridani by the middle of the next century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth says:&lt;br&gt;
”These microbots would supply the information that, fed to computers, would allow us to explore alien planets in the same way that we navigate the virtual spaces of video games or wander through online environments like Second Life. High-tech masks and data gloves, sartorial accessories considerably more comfortable than a spacesuit, would permit you to see the landscape, touch objects and even smell the air…to walk a landscape that basks in the light of another star, to hear the whistle of an alien planet’s wind and feel its sting on our faces”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current telepresence technology cannot yet simulate all human senses with the fidelity that Seth describes above but by the time this information arrives back at earth in next century things will be a little different. Barring a disaster of the natural or cultural kind, I’m sure it will be trivial to hook the information up to our femto-tech nervous systems and transport ourselves light years away to experience other worlds with all our senses (and a bunch we don’t have yet)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240584343139"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_pro-test.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd7db2dc1ef5f801</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">I am Pro-Test</title><published>2009-04-24T15:40:15Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T15:40:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/uZB6fKNBeQ8/i_am_pro-test.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/i_am_pro-test.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/04/activists-clash-peacefully-over-animal-experimentation-at-ucla-demonstrations.html"&gt;rally in LA for a group in favor of animal experimentation, Pro-Test&lt;/a&gt;, which also had a counter-rally by animal rights groups. You can guess which side I'm on in this debate: blocking experimentation on animals would kill biological research dead. The tactics of the anti-vivisectionists are also reprehensible and deserving of condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro-Test group, an offshoot of an &lt;a href="http://www.pro-test.org.uk/"&gt;Oxford, England-based group&lt;/a&gt; founded in 2006, was organized by J. David Jentsch, a UCLA neuroscientist &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-me-research13-2009apr13,0,924507.story?track=rss"&gt;who was the target of a recent attack&lt;/a&gt; by anonymous animal-rights activists.  In the attack, Jentsch&amp;#39;s car was set on fire while it was parked in front of his Westside home.  (The FBI recently announced that a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible has been increased to $75,000.)  Jentsch, who researches schizophrenia and drug addiction, conducts tests on monkeys.  While he acknowledges that some monkeys are killed as part of his research, he maintains that they do not suffer.  Jentsch was expected to speak at today&amp;#39;s rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we're biologists. We're in this business because we have a passion for the organisms we study, not because we're some kind of sick sadists. We're also currently swaddled up to our ears in regulations and monitors to prevent abuses of the animals in our care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the article discussing this rally has associated with it a poll. This makes me rather cranky—it&amp;#39;s a serious issue worth discussing, so please, don&amp;#39;t slap a stupid internet poll on it. It just means that advocacy groups will push at the numbers as if they mean something. So, please, go forth and destroy this pointless metric:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/04/activists-clash-peacefully-over-animal-experimentation-at-ucla-demonstrations.html"&gt;Can medical research on animals be conducted humanely?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes -- and I support it if the animals are treated well 27% (1872 votes)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.prosebeforehos.com/video-of-the-day/04/24/der-what-is-carbon/"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt;. No comment from me needed, let his own words speak for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing on ABC's This Week, the Ohio Republican was asked what to describe the GOP plan to dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, "which every major scientific organization said is contributing to climate change."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Boehner replied:  &lt;span&gt;"The idea that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical. Every time we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide. Every cow in the world, you know when they do what they do you've got more carbon dioxide."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We in academia are part of an insidious plot to promote Obama's socialist agenda by teaching nothing but "community organizing" all the time. At least, that's the impression you might get from right wing anti-academic freedom sites, as &lt;a href="http://collegefreedom.blogspot.com/2009/04/conservative-stupidity-while-googling.html"&gt;this quote might suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google the phrase "college and university courses in community organizing" and you get 9,990,000 entries, at least as of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem: the goon who did this search typed it into google &lt;i&gt;without the quotes&lt;/i&gt;, which means that it returned every page where a college used the word &amp;quot;college&amp;quot; and a university used the word &amp;quot;university&amp;quot; and a community used the word &amp;quot;community&amp;quot;. Properly enclose the phrase in quotes, and the number of entries you get is…two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republicans do make me despair of humanity, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to go through the information on the site myself.  So if some of the information is repetitive, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in the interest of openness and transparency, I will state my conflicts of interest up front: none.  I have not talked to a drug rep in at least 20 years.  Outside of a trip to San Francisco as a fellow, paid for by the company who was funding a drug study my boss was participating in, I have accepted no gifts or money of any kind from big (or little) pharma since I was a medical student.  Nothing.  I don’t even eat the pizza at conferences (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I am a hospital based adult Infectious Disease doctor.  I make zero money from vaccines.  In fact, I only make money if people get sick with infections.  For my bottom line, giving vaccines to prevent disease is counter productive to my bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why 14 studies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fouteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; is child (8) of &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, one of the autism organizations that, among other things,  promotes a link between vaccines and autism. The web site opens with  Amanda Peet, my favorite actress (2),  who generated a brouhaha when she suggested that vaccines were safe. As the top of the home page of fourteenstudies.org quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fourteen studies have been conducted (both here in the US and abroad), and these tests are reproducible; no matter where they are administered, or who is funding them, the conclusion is the same: there is no association between autism and vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen Studies refers to Ms. Peet as “Spokesperson for Sanofi Aventis, a vaccine manufacturer.”  They imply she is a shill for big pharma.  As best I can tell she is a spokesman for &lt;a href="http://www.vaccinateyourbaby.org/about.cfm"&gt;Vaccinateyourbaby.org&lt;/a&gt;, a site by &lt;a href="http://www.ecbt.org/"&gt;Every Child by Two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Child By Two (ECBT) was founded by former First Lady Rosalynn Carter and former First Lady of Arkansas Betty Bumpers in 1991 as a result of the measles epidemic that killed nearly 150 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced.  Whenever I think of Rosalyn Carter, I think evil incarnate.  Don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Peet is a spokesman for Vaccinate Your Baby, which gets support from the vaccine maker sanofi pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Child By Two’s Vaccinate Your Baby campaign is made possible through an unrestricted, educational grant from sanofi pasteur (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Peet is generously volunteering her time to support this cause and does not receive compensation for her time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone besides me think this is cheesy?  But this site is more about implying financial impropriety and bias, than evaluation of science. Anyone mind if I continue the theme of being a financial shill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The papers discussed at &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href="http://www.vaccinateyourbaby.org/about.cfm"&gt;Vaccinateyourbaby.org&lt;/a&gt; website, have some openness and transparency.  Both at least let you know where the funding comes from (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; website, is rife with advertisements yet nowhere can I find a statement of any financial conflicts of interest they might have.  It is a small thing, but in the interest of openness and transparency, it would be nice to know how much they take in from  advertisements, on line sales and speaking fees. Generation Rescue is a tax exempt charity, but I cannot find their financial statement on line. It would help put their position into context, at least as far as financial bias goes.  Maybe its nothing.  Maybe it is a dollar a year, like what Apple pays Steve Jobs.   Jobs appears to be doing OK. Maybe they make a good living from the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen Studies often in its criticisms links to other sites that also do not mention any potential financial conflicts of interest.  Which they probably don’t have.  We all blog out of the intrinsic goodness of out hearts, after all. But when someone asks “Amanda Peet, How Much Are They Paying You?” on a web page with 12 sponsors and advertisers of autism treatments, the moral high ground slumps into the Marianas Trench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A later in the day addendum.  I found the 990’s. The founders of GR are paid nothing.  They spend the 400K a year they take in mostly on market research and advertising. No research. A breakdown of the source of income is not available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they do at the Fourteen Studies is rate each study (and there are more than 14 studies)  with the following criteria, each worth up to 10 points: “Asked the Right Question,” “Conflict of Interest,” “Ability to Generalize,” and “Post-Publication Criticism.”  40 points would be the highest possible score. The highest score two studies received was a 5. Several received negative numbers suggesting either that those doing the scoring either did not know how to apply their own criteria, do not know how to correctly add together 4 positive numbers, or that the whole scoring system is bogus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say  “We ranked all of the studies on a forty point scale.”  Who the ‘we’ is who are doing the scoring is not mentioned.  In each of the studies evaluated on the website, you know who did the work.  Not fourteen studies. Transparency and accountability do not appear to be the strong suit of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first click to take you to the 14 studies gives a list of the studies and the only flaw they mention is the conflict of interest in each study.  I have written before on this blog about the perils of funding and the results of clinical trials.  It is not a trivial issue, but is, in and of itself, not a reason to dismiss a study. In the end the study has to rise and fall on the merits of its science and its reproducibility.  Key concept. Reproducibility.  The more a study is reproduced, the more reliable its underlying premise and the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page does give the impression that there is a widespread, well funded, conspiracy between researchers, industry and government to suppress the truth about the side effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not true.  As we all know that the  REAL widespread, well funded, conspiracy between researchers, industry and government is suppress the truth about the Kennedy assassination. And man made global warming. And the Trilateral Commission. And the Holocaust.  And UFO’s.  And Big Foot. And Homeopathy. And Fluoridation. And the Loch Ness Monster.  And and and and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality studies take time and money to complete and are not easy to do. Someone has to do them, and the only people with the resources to fund biomedical research are the government and industry. Funding bias is a two edged sword, so if we look at the studies in peer reviewed, high impact journals funded by Generation Rescue we find, well, I can’t find any published studies Generation Rescue has funded.  But if they do fund a published study that shows a link between autism and vaccines, by their own standards it will be suspect. Unless they are good guys, and so, as good guys, are resistant to funding bias.  Of course, everyone thinks they are the good guy.  Except me.  I am totally prone to be influenced (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a page on the website called “&lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org/ourstudies.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Our Studies&lt;/a&gt;,” but they are not “their studies” because Generation Rescue is responsible for the studies, but because they support Generation Rescue’s position. That is the approach of Fourteen Studies:  A good study is one that supports a vaccine/autism connection and a bad study is on that contradicts the connection. If, in the end, reality does not support your position and you do not change your opinion based on reality, then all you are left with is being a crank.  I suspect  that Generation Rescue is destined for crankdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of “their studies”, save the Lancet MMR article by Wakefield, are high impact  journals.  Two studies were funded by Cure Autism Now Foundation.  Does that invalidate them? Two are partially funded by the NIH? I thought the government were the Bad Guys.   One (besides Wakefield’s) is by researchers who testify as experts on the damage caused by vaccines.  Many do not mention conflicts of interest at all.  Thanks to an apparent disregard for copyright/intellectual property (5), you can download all the references yourself from the fourteen studies website. Not that I would encourage you to do that. I got my copies through my hospital’s library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In residency (and sometime beyond if you practice in a teaching hospital as I do) you have to suffer though, I mean, participate in Journal Club.  In Journal Club an article is chosen and then carefully analyzed line by line.  You look carefully for the strengths and weaknesses of the paper to learn how to read a paper critically.  The one take home from years of participating in Journal Club is that all studies have flaws. All of them. Our studies and their studies are have flaws and bias.  That is why most studies need to be repeated and all studies need to be taken in context. Clinical trials are messy and an individual study is rarely definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets do a modified Journal Club with the 14 (actually 19) studies.  These are all downloadable from Fourteen Studies, again, not that I suggest you violate copyright laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) “Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Database”&lt;br&gt;
Pediatrics, Thomas Verstraeten, MD (November 2003)&lt;br&gt;
They gave it a 3. Their  main issue with the paper was the politics and bias behind it.  What about the science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study they looked at HMO records of 124,170 infants for associations between neurodevelopemental disorders and thimerosal exposure. They then reevaluated the same disorders on another 16,717 children  in another HMO.  They found different associations between neurodevelopemental disorders and thimerosal exposures at the two HMO’s.  And when it came to autism and attention deficit disorder, there were no increased risks that they could determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion is a sober and reasonable evaluation of the potential confounding issues in the study that make it difficult to make a definitive statement  that thimerosal does not cause autism. It is also one of those studies that makes your brain hurt trying to wrap your brain around it.  In the conclusion they say “Although the lack of consistency between the 2 phases argues against a thimerosal effect, we believe that additional investigation is required.”  It is typical of the calm, considered discussions found in all fourteen studies of the limitations of the study in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an article that demonstrates how difficult it is to tease out risk from a single exposure in a large population using epidemiology studies.  The website suggests what is needed is a study that compares autism rates in vaccinated vrs unvaccinated children.  Given the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=186"&gt;benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, such a study could never be ethically done.  To deliberately randomize children to not getting vaccines would be immoral to do and impossible to get past an IRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That study will be possible in the future, thanks to the anti-vaccine and alternative vaccine schedule proponents.  We will be able to compare disease, death and autism rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.  I predict that the unvaccinated group may have a slightly higher autism rate.  If autism is mostly genetic,  families where vaccines are not given due to prior autism cases  will have more cases of autism when compared to vaccinated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where fourteen studies sees ethical malfeasance, I see a typical epidemiologic study. Messy, but helpful. It is one brick in the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) “Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence from Danish Population-Based Data”&lt;br&gt;
Pediatrics, Kreesten M. Madsen, MD (September 2003)&lt;br&gt;
According to fourteen studies, who gave it a 1,   “Written by a Danish vaccine company, the study made a mockery of the data, a problem the authors themselves warned of. And, the CDC engineered the entire study. This one goes beyond useless, it was fraudulent to run the numbers this way, and they knew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study they look at autism rates in Denmark during the use of thimerosal and after it was removed from the vaccines.  The rates of autism diagnosis  were stable during the thimerosal era and increased once thimerosal was removed. Suggesting that thimerosal is not associated with the development of autism (and maybe protective? (6)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mockery and fraud?  I can’t mockery or fraud in the study. They recognise the confounding factors that both the criteria for diagnosis and the ability to find cases changed during the study period and may be a confounding variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/hg2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought a nice study, and, for a retrospective epidemiologic study, fairly clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) “Continuing Increases in Autism Reported to California’s Developmental Services System”&lt;br&gt;
Archives of General Psychiatry, Robert Schechter, MD (January 2008) They gave it a 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The entire study is based on the false premise that children’s vaccines no longer contain mercury. ” Not true. The premise was that mercury exposure declined over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study looked at the prevalence of autism from 1995 to 2007.  From 1999 to 2001, when most of the thimerosal was removed from the vaccine schedule,  From 1995 to 2007 autism rates rose.  Again, demonstrating that thimerosol is protective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/hg3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another relatively clean and compelling epidemiologic study.  The “Bad” studies that show an no association between vaccines and autism are all messy, as life is messy.  They are several logs better than “Our” studies.  The best study, a randomized, prospective, blinded trial can never ethically be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) “Neuropsychological Performance 10 Years After Immunization in Infancy With Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines” Pediatrics, Alberto Eugenio Tozzi, Patrizia Bisiacchi (February 2009). A negative 2.  It is concerning that the those at Fourteen studies can take a 0 to 10 scale and, after adding 4 positive numbers,  get a negative number.  Next thing you know, they will say a study that demonstrates no association between a vaccine and autism actually shows such an association (11).  They gave it a negative two due to “such extreme fraud”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medicine, there is a dose response curve.  More drug, more effect, less drug, less effect.  The assumption, reasonable outside of the world of homeopathy, is that if groups of kids who get less thimerosal  (62.5 mcg) are compared to kids who had more thimerosal,  (137.5 mcg), there should be a less toxicity in the group that received less thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so in this study.   There was (mostly) no difference in the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 70% of the invited subjects participated in the neuropsychological assessment (N = 1403). Among the 24 neuropsychological outcomes that were evaluated, only 2 were significantly associated with thimerosal exposure. Girls with higher thimerosal intake had lower mean scores in the ﬁnger-tapping test with the dominant hand and in the Boston Naming Test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the association could have been due to chance as often happens in studies that look at multiple endpoints.  Natural noise in biologic outcomes results in the occasional outlier looking significant.  It is why studies need to be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italians had only one autism case in the study, so, while interesting on the potential for other neurotoxicities from thimerosal,  it does not directly address the issue of autism. But extreme fraud? Nope. I can’t find any.  I half expect Fourteen studies to say “The CDC is infested with  Vaccinationists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of Health as being members of the Vaccinationist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the CDC (9).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5)  “Autism and Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: Lack of Consistent Evidence for an Association”&lt;br&gt;
American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Paul Stehr-Green, DrPh, MPH (August 2003). A zero score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study they “compared the prevalence/incidence of autism in California, Sweden, and Denmark with average exposures to Thimerosal- containing vaccines.”&lt;br&gt;
They found that as the use of thimerosal declined, the rates of autism rose in all three areas.  The Swedes have much less autism than the US, whether real or diagnosed, I cannot say, but the results are as compelling as epidemiologic data gets. And there is a pattern in the studies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/hg5.jpg" width="819" height="627"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
6) “Thimerosal Exposure in Infants and Developmental Disorders: A Prospective Cohort Study in the United Kingdom Does Not Support a Causal Association”  Pediatrics, John Heron and Nick Andrews, PhD (September 2004). This study received a -4, the worst score and worst addition in the group.  Why the low score?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at 14,000 kids, when they received a vaccine, then calculated the amount of thimerosal they received, and were “compared with a number of measures of childhood cognitive and behavioral development covering the period from 6 to 91 months of age.”  They did not specifically look at autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoying for Fourteen studies, and perhaps the real reason it received a -4, is the explicitly stated result that the exposure of thimerosal was beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Contrary to expectation, it was common for the unadjusted results to suggest a beneficial effect of thimerosal exposure. For example, exposure at 3 months was inversely associated with hyperactivity and conduct problems at 47 months; motor development at 6 months and at 30 months; difficulties with sounds at 81 months; and speech therapy, special needs, and “statementing” at 91 months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mercury is good for you? I doubt it.  It demonstrates the difficulties in retrospective epidemiologic studies, that occasionally the data has what are probably not real results.  To be believed, it need to be reproduced.&lt;br&gt;
How about adverse effects from thimerosall? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could find no convincing evidence that early exposure to thimerosal had any deleterious effect on neurologic or psychological outcome when given according to an accelerated schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone besides me noticing a pattern here?  Epidemiologic studies, all coming at a problem from a different angle, all with the same result. Of course, the same result is what you would expect from a high level conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) “Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years”&lt;br&gt;
New England Journal of Medicine, Thompson WW et al. (September 27, 2007). Highest score with a 5 out of 40. No one, not even Fourteen studies, would dis the NEJM.  It is not that different from study 4 that received a -2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at “1047 children between the ages of 7 and 10 years and administered standardized tests assessing 42 neuropsychological outcomes. (We did not assess autism-spectrum disorders) ” and how much thimerosal they received in vaccines.  They found that mercury exposure in vaccines was probably not a neurotoxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The weight of the evidence in this study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal containing vaccines and immune globulins administered prenatally or during infancy and neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years. The overall pattern of results suggests that the significant associations may have been chance findings stemming from the large number of statistical tests that we performed. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)"&gt; “Association Between Thimerosal-Containing Vaccine and Autism”&lt;br&gt;
Journal of the American Medical Association, Anders Hviid, MSc (October 2003). A score of 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study looked at all children born in Denmark from 1990 and 1996 and found no difference in the rates of autism in kids vaccinated with vaccines that contained thimerosal and those that were vaccinated with vaccines that did not contain thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As best they could tell, no relation between thimerosal and autism.  They also found that as the use of thimerosal declined, the rates of autism increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was reanalyzed by Safe Minds on the assumption that cases of autism were lost and if that was factored in, autism rates declined when thimerosal was removed.  The authors disagreed with this approach, and, in an exchange in the letters sections of JAMA (curiously not mentioned at 14 studies) said they checked with the source of the data, that the numbers used were not prevalence measurements, and that cases were not lost, invalidating the analysis of Safe Minds (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) “Mercury concentrations and metabolism in infants receiving vaccines containing thimerosal: A descriptive study”&lt;br&gt;
The Lancet, Michael Pichichero, MD (November 2002). Rated zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting study that looked at mercury levels in children who received thimerosal containing vaccines and compared it to mercury blood levels in children who received thimerosal free vaccines.  The mercury in the blood of the vaccine children was about twice that of controls, but well with in what is considered safe. And 12 of the samples in the vaccine group had no detectable mercury.  It does not address the issue as to whether near homeopathic blood levels of mercury are associated with autism, but is an interesting basic science.  I would, as mentioned above, expect a dose response effect of mercury and, if the levels after vaccine are low to undetectable after vaccine, I would be skeptical, on the basis of basic pharmakotoxicity, that mercury is a cause of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen studies take? “One of the sillier studies ever performed, and the lead author is a vaccine patent-holder, no less. Absurd that this study appears on lists of studies exploring the relationship of vaccines to autism, as it doesn’t even address the topic. More absurd is the author’s complete misunderstanding of how mercury is excreted from the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t see why this is silly.  If you are to understand how ethylmercury is toxic, in part you need to understand its pharmakokinetics, how it is excreted and where it goes in the body. Which is what this study investigated and reported.  Based on the critics, I imagine they would only be satisfied if brain biopsies were done to measure mercury level in the CNS.  If you think the return of polio is ok, probably a brain biopsy would not be so bad (12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10)  “Thimerosal and Autism?”  Pediatrics, Karen Nelson, MD (March 2003). Rated zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice review that concludes, based on 60, yes 60 (when I count postive numbers, I get a postive number), which, in my world of numbers, is greater than 14, papers that there is no link between thimerosal and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11) “Lack of Association Between Rh Status, Rh Immune Globulin in Pregnancy and Autism”&lt;br&gt;
American Journal of Medical Genetics, Judith H. Miles and T. Nicole Takahashi (May 2007). Another zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks at whether Rh Immune Globulin, which contains thimerosal, is associated with autism.  It isn’t. While not a vaccine, it is a mercury exposure, and does  concern the issue as to whether or not thimerosal is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the 11 articles that address thimerosal and autism.  A very compelling series of articles that, when taken as a whole, are convincing that there is no relation between mercury and autism.  I had read the articles piecemeal  before,  but, like evolution, when read in total,  are an excellent argument that thimerosal is not associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets move on to the 7 articles concerning MMR and autism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield had a study published in Lancet titled ” Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children,” that &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;has had some issues.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated that “Onset of behavioral symptoms [autism] was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination [MMR] in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another…We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of fourteen studies is that “This relatively straightforward conclusion, that the MMR may in fact be related to autism, set off a worldwide controversy and a mini-industry of bogus scientific reports trying to refute the idea that MMR and autism are related. You will see many of the studies below.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, the Wakefield needs to be reproduced, if not true, that also needs to be determined.  The first study that looked at high dose steroids and sepsis showed benefit.  Multiple subsequent studies (or should I say  a mini-industry of bogus scientific reports trying to refute the idea that steroids were helpful) showed harm and no benefit.  A typical and annoying feature of the medical literature is differing results. It is why it is important to consider both biologic plausibility and the results of the preponderance of studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following studies, unlike the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Wakefield study,&lt;/a&gt; are bogus. Hm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12)  “Lack of Association Between Measles Virus Vaccine and Autism with Enteropathy: A Case-Control Study”&lt;br&gt;
PLoS One, Mady Hornig, Thomas Briese T, et al. (September 2008). Rated 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to believable medical information is reproducibility.  Cold fusion died because no one can reproduce it. So an association between MMR and autism will have to be reproduced to be compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tried, in part, to repeat the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Wakefield study,&lt;/a&gt; They did not get the same results.  “However, it made one critical distinction from the Wakefield approach: it didn’t recruit for the subset of children with autism who regressed after MMR vaccination.”   Evidently, neither did &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sample was an age-matched group of US children undergoing clinically-indicated ileocolonoscopy. Ileal and cecal tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone (controls) were evaluated by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for presence of MV RNA in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between MV and ASD were reported. The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR administration was examined. We found no differences between case and control groups in the presence of MV RNA in ileum and cecum. Results were consistent across the three laboratory sites. GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR timing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study  had the advantage over the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Wakefield study&lt;/a&gt; in  that the data was not made up or falsified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13)  “MMR Vaccination and Pervasive Developmental Disorders: A Case-Control Study”  The Lancet, Liam Smeeth, MRCGP, Eric Fombonne, MD (September 11, 2004). Rated a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medicine, if you want to see if there is a risk of disease in a population, you do a case control study.  The two groups differ in (hopefully) one variable.  In this study they compared “1294 cases and 4469 controls were included. 1010 cases (78·1%) had MMR vaccination recorded before diagnosis, compared with 3671 controls (82·1%) before the age at which their matched case was diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could find no association between the MMR and autism.  Fourteen studies argues that the MMR causes regression of autism, which was not the point of the study, and therefore the study is no good because it looked at the ‘wrong’ question.  It is an easy and typical criticism throughout Fourteen studies:  the study looked for and found no association using a given methodology.  The study is no good because it didn’t look at the information Fourteen studies thought it should.  Given that most studies try for a narrow focus, there will always be a component not evaluated. A common &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man"&gt;straw man&lt;/a&gt; argument throughout the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the context of the study, it is reasonable to conclude that the MMR is not associated with developing autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14) “Pervasive Developmental Disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: Prevalence and Links With Immunizations”&lt;br&gt;
Pediatrics, Eric Fombonne, MD (July 2006). Another issue with addition, it is rated -2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative number may come from the finding that “The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in thimerosal free birth cohorts was significantly higher than that in thimerosal-exposed cohorts (82.7 of 10 000 vs 59.5 of 10 000).”  Curious we now have several studies that showed thimerosal to be protective. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, they also found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pervasive developmental disorder rates significantly increased when measles-mumps-rubella vaccination uptake rates significantly decreased. In addition, pervasive developmental disorder prevalence increased at the same rate before and after the introduction in 1996 of the second measles-mumps-rubella dose, suggesting no increased risk of pervasive developmental disorder associated with a 2–measles-mumps-rubella dosing schedule before age 2 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like Truedeau. The vaccination information THEY don’t you to know:  MMR and thimerosal are protective for developing autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/mmr14.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They derived this information looking at 27,000 kids, 180 of whom had a  pervasive developmental disorder, including autism and comparing rates of autism (which went up) with thimerosal and MMR use (both of which went down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15) “No Evidence for a New Variant of Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Induced Autism”&lt;br&gt;
Pediatrics, Eric Fombonne, FRCPsych (October 2001). A one rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their insightful analysis of the article starts  “What is it with Eric Fombonne and Pediatrics? ” I do not think they approve of Fombonne. Next they will accuse him for something he didn’t do (11).  Not a sign of compelling science analysis and they do not give a reason for the 1 rating, the link takes one to another site for analysis.  Suggesting  again a mini-industry of bogus scientific ratings trying to refute the idea that MMR and autism are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, with small numbers, compared 96 children with MMR and autism to data from other studies of children with autism before and after an MMR.  Not the most compelling of methodological design (more cases are always better, especially  if looking for very rare events) and looked to support 6 hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“1. Childhood disintegrative disorder might have become more frequent;&lt;br&gt;
2. The mean and distribution of age at which parents become concerned has changed and is closer to the mean immunization age than in children who were not exposed to MMR;&lt;br&gt;
3. Regression in the development of children with autism has become more common;&lt;br&gt;
4. The age of onset of symptoms for autistic children with regression clusters around the immunization date and is different from that of autistic children without regression;&lt;br&gt;
5. Children with regressive autism may have distinct symptom and severity profiles; and&lt;br&gt;
6. Regressive autism is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, and children with regressive autism may exhibit increased frequency of inflammatory bowel disorders. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their data comparisons did not support any of the above.  Not the most convincing data set, but in the context of the above studies,  ok conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16) “No effect of MMR withdrawal on the incidence of autism: a total population study”&lt;br&gt;
Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Hideo Honda, Michael Rutter. A five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highest score in the group. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;We gave this study our highest score because it appears to actually show that MMR contributes to higher autism rates.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
The key phrase in the whole site.  Data that supports their position is good, data that doesn’t is bad. What makes a study good is not its methodology or its rigor, but if it supports vaccines casing autism. Bass Ackwards thinking.&lt;br&gt;
The position that vaccines cause autism is determined, then you look for data that supports the position.  When you read the studies, they do not support the position that the  MMR  is associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is doubly odd in that the paper’s conclusion is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccination rate in the city of Yokohama declined significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1992, and not a single vaccination was administered in 1993 or thereafter. In contrast, cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven increased significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1996 and most notably rose dramatically beginning with the birth cohort of 1993.”&lt;br&gt;
Remember reference 4? Foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Yokohama they gave ZERO MMR’s after 1993. Zip. The result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/mmr16a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/mmr16b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of hard to argue that MMR leads to autism when autism rates continue to increase after no more MMR is given. One explanation link  as to why black is really white leads to ‘404 not found error,’ the other links to a web page where, as best I can gather, they argue that the MMR withdrawal lead to a decrease in autism because there was actually an increase in autism due to increase in the use of Japanese encephalitis and single measles vaccines.  Which demonstrates that the increased autism rates that followed MMR removal were a decline in autism rates. I may have that wrong.  Read it and let me know.  Maybe the 404 site explained it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17) “Measles Vaccination and Antibody Response in Autism Spectrum Disorders”&lt;br&gt;
Archives of Disease in Childhood, Gillian Baird (February 2008). Rated a one, they must have become distracted in the MMR section as they   do not give a breakdown of how the score was derived for the last five studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at antibody to measles as a result of MMR in autism cases and controls and found no correlation.  This one study adds little to the data. It supports the lack of correlation between MMR and autism, but the last study is far more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18) “Neurologic Disorders After Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination”&lt;br&gt;
Pediatrics, Annamari Makela, MD (November 2002). Another zero without reason.&lt;br&gt;
This study looked at  535, 544 children for neurologic events after MMR.   It was more to look at encephalitis and meningitis, which were not increased as a result of the vaccine.  Autism was not also seen, but, as legitimately pointed out (the one and only legitimate sentence in the whole web site) “it used “hospitalizations” as a criteria for finding children with autism.”  Not a good way to find autism cases, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last paper in the group,&lt;br&gt;
Association of Autistic Spectrum Disorder and the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine”&lt;br&gt;
Archives of Pediatrics &amp;amp; Adolescent Medicine, Eric Fombonne, FRCPsych (July 2003) is a structured review of 28 papers that fails to demonstrate a relationship between the MMR and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really odd.  Their ‘headline’ is “Fombonne again.”&lt;br&gt;
But the authors of this reference are Kumanan Wilson, MD, MSc, FRCP(C); Ed Mills, DPH; Cory Ross, MSc, DPH, CHE; Jessie McGowan BMus, MLIS; Alex Jadad MD, DPhil, FRCP(C). I cut and pasted it from the reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For posterity’s sake, here is a screenshot before they change it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pusware.com/pictures/mmr8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they even reading the damn articles?&lt;br&gt;
The full title of the article is “Association of Autistic Spectrum Disorder and the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine&lt;br&gt;
A Systematic Review of Current Epidemiological Evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key words, left out by Fourteen studies, are ” Systematic review.”  For those who do not have to read the medical literature (bold added by me),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Systematic reviews are &lt;strong&gt;scientific investigations in themselves,&lt;/strong&gt; with pre-planned methods and an assembly of original studies as their “subjects.” They synthesize the results of multiple primary investigations by &lt;strong&gt;using strategies that limit bias and random error&lt;/strong&gt;. These strategies include a comprehensive search of all potentially relevant articles and the use of explicit, reproducible criteria in the selection of articles for review. Primary research designs and study characteristics are appraised, data are synthesized, and results are interpreted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A systematic review involves the application of scientific strategies, in ways that limit bias, to the assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies that address a specific clinical question. (7)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well done Systematic review is more that a review, it is a valuable, if less than perfect, way to evaluate a literature that tries to correct for bias and for variation in study methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want another excellent (free) review, try  &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476"&gt;Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read over 100 or so journal articles a month just for my Infectious Disease podcast. Plus those I read for patient care, for general interest, for the blogs.  They are of variable quality, from the ground breaking to the incomprehensible.  The ‘bad’ references on the fourteen studies site are by and large pretty good, especially given the methodologic, logistic and ethical problems in doing large epidemiologic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medicine, as in all of science, no single study is definitive.  Epidemiologic studies in medicine are particularly messy, and researchers never do a perfect study. I am always impressed with the ingenuity and hard work on the part of epidemiologists to get good information out of complicated and incomplete data sets. You have to read all the studies in context of biologic plausibility, the flaws in a given study, reproducibility, and, yes,  the financial bias of the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the Fourteen studies for their website.  Anyone who takes the time to read all the articles will come away convinced of the safety of both thimerosal and the MMR vaccine, especially in contrast to the quality of ‘our’  studies that purport a causation.  The moving target of the cause of autism appears to be shifting to aluminum and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;too much too soon&lt;/a&gt;. I’m skeptical on biologic plausibility grounds.   I am as certain as I can be (i.e. I  am one, preferable more,  high quality studies in a high impact journal from changing my mind)  that the vaccines, both separately and together,  are many logs safer than the diseases they prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I get to read the other blog entries on the topic. About time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;========&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I love the movie 28 Days Later and its sequel. Something about fast, mindless, infected zombies running amok, producing more mindless zombies with the resultant &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;body count&lt;/a&gt; appeals to me.  I didn’t care for Shawn of the Dead, which didn’t work as either a comedy or a zombie movie for me.  But do read World War Z if you are a zombie fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Not that I do not want to sell my soul.  I do. I just set the price higher than most want to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) In the spirit of transparency, I will admit she isn’t. A review of the Internet Movie Database suggests I have never seen her perform, but most movies I see are with my 11 year old and are animated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) JAMA letters Vol 291, No 2, page 181&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Not enough for my taste, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=60"&gt;I am a crank on the topic.&lt;/a&gt;  I think everyone  should have to list, in dollar amounts, all direct and indirect (travel, food etc) support they receive if they give CME accredited lectures or publish in journals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) I can’t download the Lancet references with paying first.  I doubt the publishers will complain as it would look like they are in cahoots with Big Pharma to suppress information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6)  I don’t really think that.  It is what the data would suggest, but I can’t really see the plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) &lt;a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/126/5/376"&gt;http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/126/5/376&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) A child evidently vaccinated against reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(9) They do not capitalize their title, very hip edgy.  For a drug company. To be really Web 2.0 it needs a random capital and a vowel removal: snoFi psTeur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(10)  Modified from Joseph McCarthy, US Senator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(11) A literary device called foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(12) “I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.” http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes at a time when New South Wales is experiencing a whooping cough epidemic, with NSW Health warning there has been a large increase in the numbers of cases diagnosed in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/whooping_c_m1696018.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black;margin:6px" title="whooping_c_m1696018" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/whooping_c_m1696018.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Health Notice states that Macquarie University has received notification of a confirmed diagnosis of whooping cough on campus. The university warns all staff and students that the bacteria known as Bordetella Pertussis, is highly contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is spread by droplets from coughing or sneezing and can be spread for up to three weeks after the onset of the cough. Persons at risk include those who are not vaccinated, those who have been in contact with an infected person but particularly babies, young children and the elderly. They provide information on how to avoid contracting the illness and the symptoms to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of my other &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-anti-vacc-movement-an-australian-perspective/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; will recall I recently did a Dr Rachie Reports on the anti-vax movement in Australia and used the death of a 4 week old baby girl as an example of the importance of being correctly vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are at risk of contracting whooping cough it is recommended you get a booster shot of the vaccine. Or contact your Doctor / Health Care provider, local public health or community health unit – look under the NSW Government Pages in the white pages directory for numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on whooping cough can be found &lt;a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/publichealth/infectious/diseases/pertussis.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; at the New South Wales department of health website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that bits of good news don’t come singly. First honours degrees in acupuncture vanish, Now a big chain of shops selling Chinese herbs and acupuncture has gone into administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that, at last, people are getting fed up with being conned out of their hard-earned money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbmedic-barking.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Herbmedic Barking&lt;/span&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local newspaper, The North Herts &lt;a href="http://www.thecomet.net/content/comet/news/story.aspx?brand=CMTOnline&amp;amp;category=News&amp;amp;tBrand=HertsCambsOnline&amp;amp;tCategory=newslatestCMT&amp;amp;itemid=WEED31%20Mar%202009%2017%3A34%3A37%3A860"&gt;Comet reported&lt;/a&gt; thus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers of Herbmedic, which trades under the name Herbs and Acupuncture, on Queensway in Stevenage have been left counting the cost after shelling out hundreds of pounds for treatment they never received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has practices across the country, is now in the hands of receivers, Macintyre Hudson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Emery, of The Paddocks in Stevenage, paid £350 for 10 treatment sessions, but only received one before the practice closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “A standard course of treatment is 10 sessions, so most customers will have bought this package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Claudia Gois, of Walden End in Stevenage, paid £240 for 12 treatment sessions but only received four before the practice closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “I went there on Friday and it was closed. There was no warning or anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I got in touch with head office and they said it’s very unlikely I will get money back. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report was on 1st April,  The &lt;a href="http://www.herbmedic.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"&gt;company’s web site&lt;/a&gt; shows no sign of any problems, In fact they are still &lt;a href="http://www.herbmedic.co.uk/company/career.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;advertising jobs&lt;/a&gt;.  So was this an April Fool joke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No it wasn’t.  A visit to Companies House soon settled the matter. The whole company is insolvent, as of 27 March 2009.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbmedic-admin.jpg" width="500" height="177"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the whole &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/herbmedic-administrator.pdf"&gt;administration notice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/herbmedic-annual-report.pdf"&gt;company report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Criticisms of Herbmedic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chain of shops was investigated by the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series10/week3.shtml"&gt;BBC’s&lt;br&gt;
Inside Out&lt;/a&gt; programme. (September 25th 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We sent an undercover reporter to branches of the Herbmedic chain in southern England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each occasion, the reporter claimed to be suffering from tiredness and was prescribed herbal remedies after a consultation lasting less than five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The herbalists, who describe themselves as “doctors”, didn’t ask any questions about the patient’s medical history or take any notes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so bad that even Andrew Fowler, a past President of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, described it as “malpractice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Herbmedic has been investigated by the authorities in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, trading standards officers prosecuted the branch in Southampton for selling herbal remedies with 26 times the permitted legal limit of lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in October 2003, the Advertising Standards Authority banned Herbmedic from describing its practitioners as “doctors”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the ban, all three of the stores visited by Inside Out referred to the herbalist as the doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also the BBC report &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/5358338.stm"&gt;Herbalists’ customers ‘at risk’&lt;/a&gt;, and a report in the Sunday Times, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article4407695.ece"&gt;Herbmedic accused of high-pressure selling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href="http://www.cap.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?Adjudication_id=36792"&gt;Advertising Standards report&lt;/a&gt;.  Seven different complaints against Herbmedic were upheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is entirely consistent with my own experience. I went into one of their shops and asked about a cure for diabetes (hoping the be able to refer them to Trading Standards, but the young lady behind the counter had such a poor grasp of English that her reply was incomprehensible. She just kept trying to push me into having a consultation with “the doctor” who appeared to speak no English at all. I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The chequered history of Herbmedic &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that his just gone into administration is Herbmedic Centre Ltd.  It has been in existence for only two years. Its predecessor, known simply as   Herbmedic, was dissolved on 13 March 2007, &lt;a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/459ce1a95b4e1899bc2a3020f195c8a9/compdetails"&gt;Companies House&lt;/a&gt; said &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt; APPLICATION FOR STRIKING-OFF &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Chinese medicine chain seems to be having a few problems too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmony Medical Distribution Ltd&lt;/strong&gt; (”specialists in acupuncture and holistic medicine”) seems to be still in business(&lt;a href="http://www.harmonymedical.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"&gt;web site here&lt;/a&gt;), but several very similar companies have been dissolved,  Harmomy Medics Ltd (dissolved 19 Sep 2006) ,, Harmony Medical Services (UK ) Ltd. (dissolved 6 May 2008) and Harmony Medical Services Ltd (dissolved 17 Oct 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this history of companies that dissolve every couple of years and then mysteriously reincarnate with a slightly different name, one wonders if this really is the end of herbmedic, or it is just a device for shedding bad debts.  Is this just another “&lt;a href="http://www.companyrescue.co.uk/company-rescue/options/Pre-Packaged-Administration.aspx"&gt;pre-pack administration&lt;/a&gt;“?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this space for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s the latest evidence on acupuncture anyway? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correspondent drew my attention to the &lt;a href="http://www.library.nhs.uk/CAM/ViewResource.aspx?resID=311356&amp;amp;tabID=289"&gt;2009 Annual Evidence Update on acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; complied by the NHS Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library. This includes no fewer than  56 &lt;a href="http://www.library.nhs.uk/CAM/ViewResource.aspx?resID=311405&amp;amp;pgID=1"&gt;systematic  reviews and meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt;.  Although the reviews are complied by alternative medicine sympathisers, they seem mostly to be pretty fair.  Well apart form one thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the reviews fail to come up with any positive evidence that acupuncture works well enough to be clinically useful.  Only two come close, and they are the two singled out as “editor’s picks”.  Perhaps that’s not entirely surprising given that the editor is &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=351"&gt;Dr Mike Cummings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, the results are inconclusive: #8 is pretty typical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture for tension-type headache: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture compared with sham for tension-type headache has limited efficacy for the reduction of headache frequency. There exists a lack of standardization of acupuncture point selection and treatment course among randomized, controlled trials. More research is needed to investigate the treatment of specific tension-type headache subtypes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vast effort and a lot of money is being put into trials, yet there are very few (if any) positive results. Very often there are no results at whatsoever.  All we hear, again and again, is “more research is needed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point someone will have to decide it is all a charade and start to spend time and money on investigating things that are more promising.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correspondent checked with Companies House to discover more about two of the directors of Herbmedic, Mr. Li Mao and Mr Xiao Xuan Chen.  They have a chequered history indeed. [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/herbmedic-directors.pdf"&gt;download the complete list&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Li Mao is, or has been, on the board of 31 different companies. Of these 6 are active, 5 are in administration, 14 were dissolved, 4 were liquidated and 2 are active with proposal to strike off.  Not only is Her Medic centre Ltd in administration, but so is Dr China (UK) Ltd, and Great Chinese Herbal Medicine Ltd &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With record like that, my correspondent wonders whether they &lt;a href="http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/directordisqualificationandrestrictions/whatisdisqualification.htm"&gt;should be disqualified&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240559349994"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1372">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cdac3b0d365ae8f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Chinese medicine chain, Herbmedic, is insolvent</title><published>2009-04-24T06:49:36Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T06:49:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dcscience.net/?p=1372" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">It seems that bits of good news don’t come singly.

&lt;p&gt;Charlie's had a good time during this Spring Break. He's spent most of it with my parents (GongGong and PoPo---Cantonese for "maternal grandfather" and "maternal grandmother") doing "nothing special": Walks in the park (once it stopped raining), trips to the grocery store, hanging around home (bringing back memories of Spring Break when I was his age----my parents both worked and my sister and I spent the week reading or practicing piano or walking to the local stores, and there went the week). I guess one of the more "interesting" things that happened was Charlie &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/because_iep_season_is_upon_us"&gt;getting his blood drawn&lt;/a&gt; for testing (and doing fabulous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One "out of routine" that did happen was that, on Tuesday night, I took the train into Manhattan to have dinner with Jim at a small Italian restaurant; afterwards, we walked down the west side by the water till we got to the Winter Garden and then took the &lt;a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/"&gt;PATH&lt;/a&gt; train from the WTC site back to New Jersey. Yes, we had a &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt;---actually, a date that was overdue by at least four months. We had planned to go out for dinner (which we rarely do) while visiting my family in California &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; but Charlle had been so unmoored by being away from home, out of all of his familiarity, that Jim and I could not leave him, and (for the first time ever) not with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;Gradually&lt;/a&gt;, things have been &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;looking up&lt;/a&gt;, so dining on fish and ravioli in a pleasantly cramped restaurant redolent with the good smells of good food gave both Jim and me a bit of buzz. &lt;em&gt;For the moment, and hopefully for a few more, things with Charlie are ok&lt;/em&gt; and we are not---as we've been since late December---in crisis mode. For Charlie and for us, education and teaching, a whole lot of patience, and a fine-tuning of our ability to listen to what he's telling us (with and without words) and to understand him as he is, have been the soundest means to help him. I put up an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/say_yes_to_pro-active_teaching_methods"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/say_yes_to_pro-active_teaching_methods"&gt;pro-active teaching methods&lt;/a&gt; because (in this &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/because_iep_season_is_upon_us"&gt;time of IEPs&lt;/a&gt;); I've been thinking a lot about how we might teach Charlie to communicate and contend with his needs and anxieties, before he gets overly stimulated, frustrated, aggravated, overwhelmed. Some of this involves us learning to better understand him, and some of this involves Charlie learning to monitor himself and know that he's getting stressed, before he actually is. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Thursday, was a sort of "hump day" to Charlie's week. He woke up later than usual, hung around in bed, had a late brunch/lunch of rice and paper-wrapped chicken (helping my mother put the little white bundles onto a baking pan). He had a vigorous walk of more than two miles in the park with my parents and then, on coming back home, did not want to get out of the car. Charlie pretty much stayed in it for the next hour and a half plus, with a brief venture out. He was in the car (the dinky one my dad had rented that shakes and quakes when it goes above 55 mph and I've been riding in the backseat with Charlie) when I came back from work. Charlie just seemed to want to sit so sit he did. My parents noted to me that Charlie had told them "Gong Gong Po Po airplane California": My parents leave in about five days, and Charlie's internal clock must have sensed that it's past the halfway point of their visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It being Spring Break, all aspects of Charlie's usual routine have been "off," and he's adapted well to this. But one thing that doesn't march to the beat of when the school district schedules Spring Break is Charlie's growing---I think I was saying he was 5' 5" about two weeks ago and now we've been saying 5' 6" because, well, he appears to have grown again. (I've been my current height since I was 13 years old or so, so this constant growing growing growing in Charlie is a novel phenomenon for me.) And growing boys need nourishment for all that growing and that means plenty of food. Generally Charlie is very proficient about asking for food but I've started to realize, he has no idea of how much his body is changing and his words just can't keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my parents we needed to get Charlie dinner &lt;em&gt;pronto&lt;/em&gt; and they did and Charlie ate with (how else to say it) &lt;em&gt;gusto&lt;/em&gt;. He was quite amenable to a walk afterwards and he and I ran ahead of my parents and followed some rabbits over the grass and into the bushes. Afterwards, and after Charlie was in his PJs, he put on his shoes and asked to go meet Jim (who was teaching at night and would be home late). Charlie acceded to our explanations about it being "too late" and settled down to build with his Legos and then went to bed and clicked through all the songs on his iPod until he found a certain Jimi Hendrix album. He listened to it, eyes wide open, until he was just about falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess even the government is not interested in saving the newspaper business....eh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1: why did they subscribe every employee? Couldn't they buy one copy and put it in the waiting room at the reception desk, or at the water cooler, or in the dining hall? Or, well, they could have come up with some kind of a video-rental store, but for books/newspapers/magazines. Oh, &lt;a href="http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/fail-book-rental1.jpg" title=""&gt;wait&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2: why don't they introduce this brand new technology to all their employees? It is called a computer and it can be used to get into a set of tubes called the Internet, where one can go on something called the World Wide Web, where one can find all the news and information using something called Teh Googlz!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/homeland_security_saves_money.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/_YhYRgIL0pY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240552212150"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3511">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d84389786b90bd00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="art"/><category term="japan"/><category term="lovely"/><title type="html">Pretty Picture Friday</title><published>2009-04-24T05:05:28Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T05:05:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/pretty-picture-friday-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s actually going to be 70 degrees here in Michigan today, so I plan to be OUTSIDE enjoying the day, and not online.&lt;/p&gt;

He had an interesting answer to the question "What should you do when Syvlia Browne comes to town?" Derek and his friends at the Skeptics and Secularists of Atlantic Canada decided to attend. He gives us this very interesting, if somewhat disheartening report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Browne is well-known to readers of &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;.  Like all professional mediums, she makes a living on the grief, pain and desperation of people who are usually blissfully ignorant of cold reading, Barnum statements and the tendency of the human mind to see what it wants to see. The best way to combat ignorance is through education and when Sylvia announced that she would be coming to Halifax, Nova Scotia as part of her latest tour – a farewell tour, apparently (let's hope she's not like Cher) – the Skeptics and Secularists of Atlantic Canada decided to give her audience some information that could save them future heartache and empty wallets.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240548808126"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/protest-war-at-ucla/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6deaf26b8512be7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="animal rights"/><category term="animal testing"/><category term="animal welfare"/><category term="UCLA"/><title type="html">Protest war at UCLA</title><published>2009-04-24T04:52:49Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T04:52:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/protest-war-at-ucla/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This time it’s an ancestor to the tyrannosaurus rex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossils date from the middle of the Cretaceous period, and may be a “missing link”, tying the familiar big &lt;em&gt;T rex&lt;/em&gt; to its much smaller ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossils show early signs of the features that became pronounced with later tyrannosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontological knowledge about the family of dinosaurs known as tyrannosaurs is based around two distinct groups of fossils from different parts of the Cretaceous period, which ran from approximately 145 to 65 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those keeping count, that’s 144,994,000 to 64,994,000 years before the existence of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And notice that the T-Rex comes from the Cretaceous period and not the Jurassic Period, as some recently deceased science fiction writers would have us believe:&lt;/p&gt;

After all, The War on Christmas ended in December. . .and Religulous has been out on DVD for a while now. . .and Webster Cook and PZ Myers defiled Cracker Jesus almost 9 months ago. . . and the chocolate Jesus statue hasn’t been heard from in a year. . .and nobody even saw the movie Goya’s Ghost anyway. . .and The Golden Compass hasn’t been in theaters since 2007. . .and The Da Vinci Code has been out of theaters longer than that. . .and the ABC TV show Nothing Sacred was cancelled 10 years before that around the time Dogma left theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after protesting EVERYTHING already, what the fuck is making Donahue angry now? &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE53L04020090422"&gt;This time it’s the movie Angels and Demons that’s got hold of the stick up Donahue’s ass:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donahue accused Brown and Howard of “smearing the Catholic Church with fabulously bogus tales.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Ron Howard responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And let me be a little controversial: I believe Catholics, including most in the hierarchy of the Church, will enjoy the movie for what it is: an exciting mystery, set in the awe-inspiring beauty of Rome,” Howard wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Ron Howard has far more diplomacy than I do as I would have told Donahue to grow up and get a fuckin’ life, followed by an detailed explanation of how actors pretend to be other people to play out stories that aren’t real and that if Donahue ever sees a moving train on a film screen, it can’t harm him because it’s only an illusion. Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

— a rather peculiar topic for Forbes, I suppose, but they put together a pretty decent lineup of contributors. From the Language Log family there&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/new-real-words-opinions-books-mcwhorter.html"&gt;John McWhorter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/how-language-made-options-books-zimmer.html"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, with good friends of LL &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/new-words-survival-opinions-books-barrett.html"&gt;Grant Barrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/emerging-prefixes-suffixes-opinions-books-peters.html"&gt;Mark Peters&lt;/a&gt; also pitching in. There really was no news hook for the report, unless you count the claim by Global Language Monitor that English will be adding its millionth word on April 29, 2009. No, make that June 8. Scratch that, June 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January when I wrote &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=972"&gt;The 'million word' hoax rolls along&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; I observed that Paul Payack of Global Language Monitor had pushed the supposed date for the addition of the millionth English word (according to his secret algorithm) from 2006 to 2007 to 2008 to 2009. Payack was then claiming with pseudo-scientific precision that the millionth word would finally arrive &amp;quot;within a ten-day period centered upon April 29, 2009.&amp;quot; That date, conveniently enough, happened to coincide with the publication of the paperback edition of Payack&amp;#39;s book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806528583/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Million Words and Counting: How Global English Is Rewriting The World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=972#comment-16794"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Payack denied that the new date he had set for the millionth word had anything to do with his publishing schedule, and to his credit he has nipped that criticism in the bud… by extending the deadline yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the BBC checked in on the million-word claim for a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8011657.stm"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; broadcast on April 22, they discovered that the &amp;quot;ten-day period centered on April 29&amp;quot; prediction had been superseded, just like every other prediction made by Payack since 2006. The BBC gave the new magical date as June 8, 2009, and this is the date that I used when I did some last-minute fact-checking for my &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/how-language-made-options-books-zimmer.html"&gt;Forbes article&lt;/a&gt;, which mentions the million-word claim in passing.  Then earlier this evening I checked back on the &lt;a href="http://www.languagemonitor.com/"&gt;GLM site&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that Payack had of course moved the goalposts again: he now announces that &amp;quot;English will cross the Million Word Mark on June 10th, 2009 at 10:22 am (Stratford-on-Avon Time).&amp;quot; And he&amp;#39;s got a countdown clock and everything, so maybe he&amp;#39;s serious this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC does at least touch upon the criticism of Payack's methodology and the constant date-changing of his predictions. But for any other journalists out there who might be lured by the million-word claim as an irresistible news hook, I would direct them to this quote from Mr. Payack from a skeptical Feb. 1 article in &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/580454"&gt;The Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt; (which opens with the wonderful image of Canadian Oxford Dictionary editor Katherine Barber giggling uncontrollably over the phone):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t be precise,&amp;quot; concedes Payack. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re talking from a poet&amp;#39;s perspective. I&amp;#39;m a word lover, not a linguist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Star goes on to say that &amp;quot;the whole point, apart from the obvious publicity, is to celebrate the richness of the language.&amp;quot; I think we can all get on board with that sentiment, poets and linguists alike, so let&amp;#39;s dispense with the million-word hogwash once and for all, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240544221433"><id gr:original-id="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/?p=363">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aacd395f3de3c82c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Unintelligent Design…..</title><published>2009-04-24T03:36:46Z</published><updated>2009-04-24T03:36:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/unintelligent-design/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://spacecityskeptics.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If man was created in god’s image, then god has lower back pain and an enlarged prostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;       &lt;b&gt;3. where does science journalism fit in this change? Science is arguably a ripe place for doers (scientists) to do much of what science journalists now do. What do/might (good) sci-journos bring that needs to stay in a new model/hybrid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday 23 April, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who falsely promote and provide unethical, fraudulent and potentially dangerous treatment for cancer are the focus of three significant documents launched by the Cancer Council today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book titled ‘&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/complimentary_altern_therapies1.pdf"&gt;Complementary and alternate cancer therapies&lt;/a&gt;‘, a &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/al602_establishedtreatments.pdf"&gt;fact sheet to help patients&lt;/a&gt; and their families make decisions about therapies and another &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cam_info_sheet_communwithpatients.pdf"&gt;fact sheet for medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; with tips on how to help patients avoid such practices has been produced with funding from the State Government of Victoria, Department of Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cancer-quackery.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black;margin:6px" title="cancer-quackery" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cancer-quackery-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cancer-quackery.tiff"&gt;&lt;img title="cancer-quackery" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cancer-quackery.tiff" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Many people with cancer use some sort of complementary therapies for legitimate reasons such as maintaining hope and staying in control of their situation,” Dr Amanda Hordern, Deputy Director of the Cancer Information and Support Service said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health professionals are the best people to help people make a safe treatment choice so we have gone to great lengths to publish  some guidelines to assist them with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Targeting sick people with unproven alternative therapies can be fraudulent and may have a huge effect emotionally, physically and financially on the person with cancer and their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new information has been developed to help people recognise which therapies may be helpful and which may be making false claims. This is an important aspect with many complementary and alternative therapies proving to be a risk for some cancer patients,” Dr Hordern said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Michael Jefford, Clinical Consultant to the Cancer Council said people usually used these treatments hoping to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are hoping to shrink or even cure their cancer, deal with side effects, or just improve how they’re feeling,” Associate Professor Jefford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sadly, people with cancer rarely discuss the use of complementary and alternative cancer therapies with their cancer specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are particularly concerned if people use unproven, alternative treatments instead of standard treatment options. They need to discuss all options with their doctor and then make an informed decision on alternative therapies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A major worry is when people with curable cancers don’t get the treatments that could cure their disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about access for patients to the right information and ensuring that they come to the best possible decision that will give them the best possible chance of dealing with their illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cancer Council Victoria has developed some really good information about these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Cancer Council Helpline has easy access to information about a lot of complementary and alternative medicines. Also, the Cancer Council is training health professionals to talk about complementary and alternative medicines with their patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer Council Victoria keeps statistics on all cancers in Victoria and over the past 20 years survival rates have increased year on year. Detailed stats can be found at www.cancervic.org.au.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The booklet and fact sheets are available free, through the Cancer Council Helpline, 13 11 20, and are also available online.&lt;/p&gt;

As always, you should &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/357" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/254" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/261" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005322" title=""&gt;Innervation of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons by Peptidergic Neurons Conveying Circadian or Energy Balance Information in the Mouse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) produced in neurons in the basal forebrain is the primary regulator of reproductive maturation and function in mammals. Peptidergic signals relating to circadian timing and energy balance are an important influence on the reproductive axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the innervation of GnRH neurons by peptidergic neurons. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to detect appositions of peptidergic fibers (NPY, β-endorphin, MCH) associated with energy balance and metabolic status in transgenic mice expressing a green fluorescent protein reporter construct in GnRH neurons. The frequency of these appositions was compared to those of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a hypothalamic neuropeptide likely to convey circadian timing information to the GnRH secretory system. The majority of GnRH neurons (73-87%) were closely apposed by fibers expressing NPY, β-endorphin, or MCH, and a significant proportion of GnRH neurons (28%) also had close contacts with VIP-ir fibers. It is concluded that GnRH neurons in the mouse receive a high frequency of direct modulatory inputs from multiple hypothalamic peptide systems known to be important in conveying circadian information and signalling energy balance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005330" title=""&gt;Lead Bullet Fragments in Venison from Rifle-Killed Deer: Potential for Human Dietary Exposure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human consumers of wildlife killed with lead ammunition may be exposed to health risks associated with lead ingestion. This hypothesis is based on published studies showing elevated blood lead concentrations in subsistence hunter populations, retention of ammunition residues in the tissues of hunter-killed animals, and systemic, cognitive, and behavioral disorders associated with human lead body burdens once considered safe. Our objective was to determine the incidence and bioavailability of lead bullet fragments in hunter-killed venison, a widely-eaten food among hunters and their families. We radiographed 30 eviscerated carcasses of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) shot by hunters with standard lead-core, copper-jacketed bullets under normal hunting conditions. All carcasses showed metal fragments (geometric mean = 136 fragments, range = 15-409) and widespread fragment dispersion. We took each carcass to a separate meat processor and fluoroscopically scanned the resulting meat packages; fluoroscopy revealed metal fragments in the ground meat packages of 24 (80%) of the 30 deer; 32% of 234 ground meat packages contained at least one fragment. Fragments were identified as lead by ICP in 93% of 27 samples. Isotope ratios of lead in meat matched the ratios of bullets, and differed from background lead in bone. We fed fragment-containing venison to four pigs to test bioavailability; four controls received venison without fragments from the same deer. Mean blood lead concentrations in pigs peaked at 2.29 µg/dL (maximum 3.8 µg/dL) 2 days following ingestion of fragment-containing venison, significantly higher than the 0.63 µg/dL averaged by controls. We conclude that people risk exposure to bioavailable lead from bullet fragments when they eat venison from deer killed with standard lead-based rifle bullets and processed under normal procedures. At risk in the U.S. are some ten million hunters, their families, and low-income beneficiaries of venison donations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005334" title=""&gt;Familial Resemblance of Borderline Personality Disorder Features: Genetic or Cultural Transmission?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Borderline personality disorder is a severe personality disorder for which genetic research has been limited to family studies and classical twin studies. These studies indicate that genetic effects explain 35 to 45% of the variance in borderline personality disorder and borderline personality features. However, effects of non-additive (dominance) genetic factors, non-random mating and cultural transmission have generally not been explored. In the present study an extended twin-family design was applied to self-report data of twins (N = 5,017) and their siblings (N = 1,266), parents (N = 3,064) and spouses (N = 939) from 4,015 families, to estimate the effects of additive and non-additive genetic and environmental factors, cultural transmission and non-random mating on individual differences in borderline personality features. Results showed that resemblance among biological relatives could completely be attributed to genetic effects. Variation in borderline personality features was explained by additive genetic (21%; 95% CI 17-26%) and dominant genetic (24%; 95% CI 17-31%) factors. Environmental influences (55%; 95% CI 51-60%) explained the remaining variance. Significant resemblance between spouses was observed, which was best explained by phenotypic assortative mating, but it had only a small effect on the genetic variance (1% of the total variance). There was no effect of cultural transmission from parents to offspring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will note in the &lt;a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/09/content_11157349.htm"&gt;this news story from China&lt;/a&gt; that there have lately been calls for a speedy and complete restitution of the complex / traditional (FANTI) characters.  Of course, that won't happen (at least not right away), but if you read between the lines, it does seem that there will be a retrenchment of the simplified (JIANTI) characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, during the leadup to the promulgation of the new list of revised characters, we will see many more articles like this one from today's Economist, &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13528023"&gt;"Not as easy as it looks."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an excellent account of this most contentious issue, I strongly recommend an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/updates.php?searchterm=0903characters.inc"&gt;&amp;quot;The Chinese Character — no simple matter&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; from the China Heritage Quarterly of The Australian National University, 17 (March, 2009). Note particularly the link to chinaSmack near the end for netizens' reactions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an argument — Simplified vs. Complicated / Traditional — that will never end. Simplification is a process that has been going on since the very birth of the script. Conversely, the opposite trend of complexification has also been going on since the early stages of the script. Witness our discussion of the extremely rare 馬馬馬 vs. 騁 in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/?p=1355"&gt;this recent post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those Chinese language reformers who advocate alphabetization (e.g., Lu Xun, Ni Haishu, Lü Shuxiang, Zhou Youguang, Yin Binyong, Apollo Wu, John DeFrancis, and countless others), whether as part of a digraphia or by itself, simplification is a stopgap measure. Many of these scholars feel that simplification actually exacerbates the problems posed by the traditional forms of the characters. And then there is Jacob von Bisterfeld, whose call for romanization was — quite amazingly — published yesterday in the Shanghai Daily as &lt;a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2009/200904/20090422/article_398414.htm"&gt;"In praise of learning alphabets, not grueling study of characters."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Condoms are for me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you ran out, bought yourself some latex, non-latex, glow in the dark, french ticklers, flavored and edible condoms; and hooked up with a dreamy geek at your local Skeptics in the Pub last night. You got home, handed him your basket of assorted sheaths, and he said, “Rigorous scientific testing is required!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then somewhere between the 3rd and 7th round of testing, you experienced a failure. One of your glow-in-the-darks broke or maybe you mistook an edible for a non-edible. Either way, the mistake was realized after the deed was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to turn to &lt;a href="http://www.go2planb.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! Now available OTC to all ladies age 17 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Plan B?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B, aka “the morning-after pill” is an emergency back up to your normal contraceptive. &lt;strong&gt;It is not meant to be used as routine birth control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B is a treatment course of 2 pills, taken 12 hours apart, the first pill being taken within 72 hours after the&lt;em&gt; oopsy&lt;/em&gt; incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pills are similar to birth control pills. They contain a high level of levonorgestrel, a hormone contained in many BC pills, which stops ovulation, or if ovulation has occured, prevents fertiliazation and implantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you get Plan B?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Plan B is OTC, it isn’t sold on the shelves between the condoms and Airborne. You have to get it from the pharmacist. The &lt;a href="http://www.go2planb.com/plan-b-pharmacy.aspx"&gt;official website &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.go2planb.com/plan-b-pharmacy.aspx"&gt;can tell  you&lt;/a&gt; what local pharmacies carry it. But, to be safe, I recommend calling ahead to find out if they have it in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who is hesitant to walk up to the counter and ask for it, the Plan B website has &lt;a href="http://www.go2planb.com/patientrequestcard.html"&gt;a card you can print up&lt;/a&gt; and hand to your pharmacist. (It currently says that prescription is needed for ages 17 and under, but I expect it will be updated soon to reflect the new law.) So if you’re worried about being harrassed by customers who disagree with your lifestyle choice, or you just want to make it look like you have a secret junior-high style crush on the pharmacist, you can just pass him the note. (”Do you think I’m cute? [yes] [no] If so, I need Plan B.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Plan B the same as RU486?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B is a hormone pill that works like a birth control pill in that it prevents pregnancy from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RU486, the abortion pill, is used to terminate early pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; terminate a pregnancy; it cannot. It can only prevent it from occurring in the first place. If you are already pregnant, Plan B will do nothing to remedy your situation. In fact, if you are pregnant and your hobby is spending money on useless medications, Plan B is perfectly safe to take during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B stops ovulation and prevents fertilization. Essentially, you’re just sending sperm on a snipe hunt - a snipe hunt that will ultimately lead to their demise, but a fools’ errand nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How effective is Plan B?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If taken properly, effectiveness is around 89% - slightly more effective (about 5%) than improperly used condoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why can’t Plan B be used as Plan A?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called Plan B for a reason. The first reason is that it has a failure rate of over 10%. Other hormone-based birth controls (to be discussed soon) are much more effective - the best being over 99% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also comes with some rather unpleasant side effects. One Skepchick blogger said that, after using Plan B, she was so nauseous, she couldn’t get out of bed for 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.go2planb.com/plan-b-safety.aspx"&gt;The side effects&lt;/a&gt; are similar to what you’d normally experience with your period or early pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Nausea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Heavier Menstrual Bleeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Lighter Menstrual Bleeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Breast Tenderness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If vomiting occurs within one hour of taking either pill, it reduces the effectiveness. Call your doctor right away if this happens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, having sex again during the same menstrual cycle is contraindicated with Plan B due to the reduction in efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Plan B is a good Plan A if you have sex less than once a month and can commit to never having more than that, aren’t too worried about the failure rate of your birth control, and don’t mind spending a few days sick in bed after each time you have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11% Failure rate when used correctly? How to I know it worked?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s a waiting game. The only way to know that the pills worked is that you get your period. This should happen within 1 week of when you regularly expect it. If it’s over a week late, you need to pee on a stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isn’t this going to start a 17-year-old-slut epidemic?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17-year-olds are going to have sex whether you give them birth control or not. There’s no evidence to indicate that the choices made by teenagers in the heat of the moment, in the back of a van, are in any way influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.Which is exactly the reason Meat Loaf’s &lt;em&gt;Paradise by the Dashboard Lights &lt;/em&gt;has absolutely no references to medical interventions in conception. (Also, “And now I’m praying for the FDA”  just doesn’t have the same cheese-factor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re hoping your kid doesn’t have sex, you’re better off having a discussion with them about it than expecting society to stop them for you. And if you don’t want your kid to get (or get anyone else) pregnant, you better discuss birth control options. Babies don’t just magically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What happens if a guy takes Plan B?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Plan B is 100% effective in preventing pregnancies in men, I don’t recommend taking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: Regardless of whether the male partner takes Plan B or not, the female partner will still need to take it to avoid pregnancy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective at preventing pregnancy in an emergency, more effective the sooner it is taken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to obtain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to take&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderately priced at around $45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not as effective as primary forms of birth control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time sensitive. First pull must be taken within 72 hours and second pill must be taken 12 hours after the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectiveness decreases over the course of the 72 hours, and is useless if taken after 72 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not protect against STDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstinence is recommended for the remainder of the menstrual cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side effects may be unpleasant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side effect of vomiting may result in the pill not working at all&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: Plan B is an excellent plan b, but a really shitty plan A. Ideally, you don’t want to have to use it. Realistically, you may have to.

&lt;p&gt;They were the first skeptical podcast, and in fact one of the very first podcasts there ever was! To celebrate, they reminisce a bit, and have a few familiar voices sending congrats. I just listened to it and it made me smile a lot; D&amp;amp;S rock. They have been tireless supporters of critical thinking, and the modern movement owes them a huge debt.

This second situation points out that the consequences of the lack of understanding of disability on the part of the public can have seriously dangerous, perhaps life-threatening implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If being denied access to a bar for being disabled doesn't sound bad enough to inspire some social change, perhaps being wrongfully arrested and jailed for being disabled will be more of a wake-up call.

&lt;p&gt;These included animal rights positions, which held that animals have inherent rights not to have their bodies transgressed (or that, by virtue of their capacity to suffer, they have rights not to be used in ways that might lead to their suffering), and animal welfare positions, which hold that animal suffering matters -- that it is something to be avoided or minimized -- but do not ground the ethical importance of animal suffering in animals' status as right-bearers.  And, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Besides the animal rights and animal welfare positions, there is also the possibility of staking out a position that holds that animals and animal suffering have no moral significance, that animals are not deserving of any special regard.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, I want to start with some insightful remarks from a friend of mine, philosopher Vance Ricks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you describe "dialogue" in that post, it sounds as though you're mostly focusing on communication between A and B. One wrinkle in the animal research case (and many ethical cases generally) is that A and B aren't just (not) talking to each other; they're talking to each other AND to an indeterminate audience they're hoping to reach. 

&lt;p&gt;I know (from my own experience) that there are plenty of times when I have not trusted my actual dialogue "partner" in the ways that you mention, but where at the same time I knew that behind/beside/near that person, there were other people who I did trust slightly more -- and so, I wasn't really addressing my ostensible partner so much as I was addressing a range of people including that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think that that makes a difference to what we count either as "dialogue" or as impediments?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Vance raises a really important point.&lt;br&gt;

State universities are going to take massive financial hits, and the University of Florida has decided to adapt to those hits by effectively eliminating whole departments, including the Geology department.  Those who have any influence in Florida should contact the appropriate state legislators ASAP: the negotiations are going on right now and will be finished over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of the several universities in the state system vary.  The University of South Florida is cutting jobs, but not laying off untenured or tenured faculty.  The University of Florida, on the other hand, is cutting whole programs.  Nothing like a meat axe to encourage higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make three points now-- to do so I&amp;#39;ll quote Carrey &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
Recently, I was amazed to hear a commentary by CNN&amp;#39;s Campbell Brown on the controversial vaccine issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The &amp;quot;vaccine issue&amp;quot; is only controversial to a small, well-funded, fringe element -- called by some the&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/laws-of-internet-discussion-announcing-oracs-law.html"&gt; Society to Promote Vaccine-Preventable Diseas&lt;/a&gt;e -- represented by J. B. Handley&amp;#39;s Generation Rescue and its celebrity mouthpieces Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey. The weight of the scientific evidence is that the current vaccine schedule is both effective in preventing disease and safe--as free as possible of side-effects.. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

On to Carrey&amp;#39;s innuendos. He makes it seem a bad thing that:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are more than 100 vaccines in development,
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the way Carrey&amp;#39;s essay is structured leads the reader to believe that 1&lt;em&gt;00 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;infant or pediatric vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; are in development.  Hold that thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, note that Carrey never mentions a reason other than &amp;quot;profitability&amp;quot; for vaccine development.  Don&amp;#39;t let his rhetoric confuse you:  remember the primary reason for vaccine development: &lt;strong&gt;there are diseases that cause human suffering, disability, and death&lt;/strong&gt;. The purpose of vaccines is to eliminate the suffering, disability,and death. Hold that thought, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where Carrey gets the &amp;quot;more than 100 vaccines in development&amp;quot; figure.  Carrey&amp;#39;s estimate of vaccines in development may be low. A &lt;a href="http://cdc.confex.com/cdc/nic2008/webprogram/Paper15635.htm"&gt;poster at the 2008 National Immunization Conference &lt;/a&gt; indicates that over 400 vaccines are in various stages of development. This does not mean that 400+ &lt;strong&gt;diseases&lt;/strong&gt; are being addressed through vaccine development, but 400+ &lt;strong&gt;vaccine formulations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are all the vaccines in development for infant or pediatric use?  No: many of the vaccines in development would be for adult use: against diseases such as HIV,  various cancer vaccines, food-borne illnesses such as salmonella, and tropical diseases. The 400+ figure is for vaccines in all stages of development.  Most vaccine formulations is the preliminary phase don&amp;#39;t make it even as far as clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s back up to Carrey&amp;#39;s innuendo: &lt;strong&gt;the profitability of vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
With vaccines being the fastest growing division of the pharmaceutical industry, isn&amp;#39;t it possible that profits may play a part in the decision-making? That the vaccine program is becoming more of a profit engine than a means of prevention?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This claim is quite disingenious. Yes, the formerly stogy vaccine segment is growing -- but it isn&amp;#39;t in the pediatric vaccine sector. &lt;a href="http://www.aegis.com/news/upi/2007/UPI070216.html"&gt; From the 2007 AEIGis report:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
adult vaccines will see a big spike due to increased uptake of influenza and hepatitis vaccines, predicts a report from Kalorama Information.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cancer vaccines will also become a major player in the vaccine market, rising from its current level of $135 million to more than $8 billion by 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;We anticipate phenomenal growth in cancer vaccines,&amp;quot; Bruce Carlson, the Kalorama Information editor who worked on the report, told United Press International. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

From the &lt;a href="http://www.bionity.com/news/e/87950/"&gt;Global Vaccine Market Prediction through 2012&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to lower margins and the mature nature of these markets, the &lt;strong&gt;basic and enhanced paediatric markets are expected to show stagnant growth&lt;/strong&gt; in future. On the other hand, launch of a number of new vaccines will make the addiction, cancer and proprietary paediatrics/adolescent vaccine market highly dynamic. On a whole, the global vaccine market is expected to register revenues in excess of US$ 30 Billion by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Carrey&amp;#39;s next next slimy piece of innuendo and one big, fat lie.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Paul Offit, the vaccine advocate and profiteer, who helped invent a Rotavirus vaccine is said to have paved the way for his own multi-million dollar windfall while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children&amp;#39;s schedule.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I very strongly object to Carrey&amp;#39;s slander here.  Step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Profiteering&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; implies an unethical act, associated with price fixing and price gouging. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Windfall&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;Money received which was not expected and not a direct result of something the recipient did.&amp;quot;  The phrase &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children&amp;#39;s schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; is just a malicious lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember the idea that vaccines are developed to prevent &lt;strong&gt;suffering?&lt;/strong&gt;  Here&amp;#39;s&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm57e625a1.htm"&gt; the toll for rotavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis among infants and young children, accounting for an estimated 527,000 deaths among children aged &amp;lt;5 years worldwide in 2004 (1,2). In the United States, rotavirus causes few deaths (20--60) each year, but &lt;strong&gt;remains a substantial cause of morbidity&lt;/strong&gt; among children, resulting in approximately 55,000--70,000 hospitalizations, 205,000--272,000 emergency department (ED) visits, and 410,000 physician office visits (3). In the continental United States, rotavirus activity follows a distinct winter-spring seasonal pattern (4). In winter months, approximately 50% of hospitalizations and ED visits and 30% of outpatient visits for acute gastroenteritis among U.S. children aged &amp;lt;3 years are caused by rotavirus (5).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worldwide, rotavirus killed approximately 500,000 per year in 2004.&lt;/strong&gt;  According to an April 2, 2009 report, 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/590518"&gt;Rotavirus is one of the most deadly diseases&lt;/a&gt; children in the developing world face,&amp;quot; Dr. John Wecker, PATH director of immunization solutions, said in a news release. &amp;quot;Vaccination holds the key to making this disease one of the most preventable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; How is it that Dr. Offit, who worked for 20 years to develop a vaccine that prevents the needless death of infants world-wide, can be said to be a &amp;quot;profiteer&amp;quot;?  How is his share (whatever the size) of the royalties from Rotateq be said to be &amp;quot;a windfall&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lie:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Paul Offit...is said to have paved the way for his own multi-million dollar [compensation] while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children&amp;#39;s schedule. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

What really happened:

Dr. Offit was a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from &lt;strong&gt;1998 to 2003.&lt;/strong&gt; RotaTeq, the vaccine that Dr. Offit helped to create, &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/Cber/products/rotateq.htm"&gt;was granted approval in February 2006&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;three years after Dr. Offit&amp;#39;s service on ACIP. 
&lt;/strong&gt;

Furthermore, Dr. Offit&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;conflict of interest&amp;quot; behavior while serving on the ACIP, as reported by &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1022"&gt;Sullivan at LeftBrain/RightBrain in August 2008:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Offit was a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1998 to 2003. During this time he had to vote on a competitor’s rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield). (People seem to have a habit of confusing RotaShield with Dr. Offit (and team’s) RotaTeq)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, when RotaShield, the competitor’s vaccine, came up for vote, what Did Dr. Offit say? He voted to include it in the schedule. It’s hard to spin that as something that would benefit Dr. Offit, as it clearly meant that the marketability of his own vaccine was reduced.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rotashield was found to potentially cause intussusception. The numbers affected were too small to detect in the trial, so this concern was raised after the vaccine was added to the schedule. the ACIP took a vote on whether to remove RotaShield from the schedule—a move that clearly had potential benefits for Dr. Offit, so he abstained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

If you are as disgusted as I am by Carrey&amp;#39;s lies and misrepresentations, send him a letter via Autism.Change.Org:

&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/tell_jim_carrey_that_hes_wrong_about_vaccines_and_autism"&gt;Tell Jim Carrey that hw is wrong about vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt; from Autism.Change.Org:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

All the publicity surrounding the claims of a vaccine-autism link has diverted attention and energy away from focusing on issues of pressing importance to individuals on the autism spectrum including education and schools, services, employment, and housing.

Ask Jim Carrey to reconsider his statements about vaccines and autism and, if he wishes to advocate for autism, to rather direct his energies to support services and education for individuals on the autism spectrum. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The suggested text of the letter. Feel free to compose your own message and post it at the Change.org link, above:


&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Mr. Carrey,


I have read your recent article in &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html"&gt;The Judgment on Vaccines Is In???&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; in which you assert that &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t know enough to announce that all vaccines are safe&amp;quot; and that further research about a possible vaccine-autism link is necessary. Further research has and is being done, and the scientific evidence refuting this hypothetical link is steadily accruing. Nonetheless, this issue continues to hold the attention of the public and of parents who have become fearful of vaccinating their young children. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is unfortunate that, due to your celebrity, many people will listen to your statements about vaccines and even decide not to have their children receive the vaccines that are important for their health. Please reconsider your statements about vaccines and autism and please rather direct your energies to supporting services and education for individuals on the autism spectrum. 
&lt;/em&gt;

I’ll quote the first part because it actually pertains to some of the research that I am doing right now—and will talk about this summer in Iowa at &lt;a href="http://ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/smbe/" rel="external "&gt;SMBE&lt;/a&gt; (hopefully) and in Idaho at &lt;a href="http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/evolution09/" rel="external "&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH: What are the most exciting recent developments in systematics / comparative methods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JF: The availability of genome-scale information is certainly one. The arrival of a generation of young researchers who are comfortable with statistical and computational approaches is another. But the most important development is reflected in recent work on coalescent trees of gene copies within trees of species. What this does is tie together between-species molecular evolution and within-species population genetics. Those two lines of work have been developing almost independently since the 1960s. But now, with population samples of sequences at multiple loci in multiple related species, they are coming back together. This is not another Modern Synthesis, but it is a major event that needs a name. How about the “Family Reunion”? Long-estranged relatives who have not been in touch are getting together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randi takes a different tone this time as a recent letter has shown that his adopted country is sometimes less than compassionate. Are politics more important than people? Maybe, but it shouldn't be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Randi -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand this:  I heartily endorse and accept marijuana use for medical purposes; research has clearly shown that it works efficiently in that role, and brings comfort and relief to the suffering.  As a result of this stated conditional acceptance, I have been approached by those who advocate general use of the substance on the same level that tobacco enjoys.  Generally, this makes sense to me, except that if its use were to bring with it the same dreadful health penalties that accompany tobacco, I would be reluctant to accept that.  I am not a drug user, I have never even been inebriated.  That is my personal choice, and I feel that other persons should also enjoy freedom of choice, even if taxes are imposed on that freedom in order to legislate it; I don’t want out-of-control drivers threatening my safety, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/carrey_measles.jpg" alt="Jim Carrey maybe isn’t a medical doctor."&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with Jenny McCarthy must have infected Jim Carrey’s brain, because yesterday he posted an astonishingly fallacious antivaccination propaganda piece for &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html"&gt;the Huffington Post screed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrey is the boyfriend of Public Health Threat &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/02/jenny-mccarthy-counts-for-something/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and has been an antivaccination advocate for some time. He is a funny guy and a movie star, but I don’t think either of those things should give him a public voice wherein he can mislead people about vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article Carrey wrote has so much wrong in it that it almost qualifies as self-satirizing. His very first paragraph is a textbook example of spin. Basically, a few months ago &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/12/court-rules-no-link-between-autism-and-vaccines/"&gt;a special court looked at three cases of potential damage due to vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, and found no evidence of any connection. About this, Carrey says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…a ruling against causation in three cases out of more than 5000 hardly proves that other children won’t be adversely affected by the MMR, let alone that all vaccines are safe. This is a huge leap of logic by anyone’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last line comes dangerously close to an out-and-out lie on Carrey’s part, and it’s certainly dead wrong. The three cases that were presented to the special courts &lt;em&gt;were chosen by the people presenting the cases themselves as the strongest of all their claims&lt;/em&gt;. And the courts did far more than simply find no link between between vaccines and autism; they called the antivax claims &amp;quot;speculative and unpersuasive.&amp;quot; One of the special masters (the judge, essentially) in the cases also said that the parents of one child had &amp;quot;been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that &amp;quot;huge leap of logic&amp;quot; Carrey complains about is actually a carefully reasoned and literally judicious step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His case gets worse from there, and in fact contains this whopper: &amp;quot;We have never argued that people shouldn’t be immunized for the most serious threats including measles and polio.&amp;quot; I suppose that all depends on who he means by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;; if it includes Jenny McCarthy and their autism organization, well then it’s not exactly the truth, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;as that is precisely and exactly what they been advocating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into anything more Carrey says; you can read the smackdowns at &lt;a href="http://skepticdad.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/jim-carrey-goes-solo-against-vaccines/"&gt;Skeptic Dad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2200"&gt;Left Brain Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; [edited to add: and &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/articles/opinion-jim-carrey-s-autism-claims-are-wrong"&gt;Opposing Views&lt;/a&gt;] to see many other things he says which are completely wrong. More will come, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bothers me greatly that people with no scientific training and who are indeed ignoring and distorting scientific results have such a loud voice in the media, especially when it comes to the health of our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I for one will never watch another Jim Carrey movie again, ever.&lt;/strong&gt; I will make sure not a single dime of mine will go into his pocket, money that he will use to ultimately put the children of our nation and the world at risk of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism. But what Carrey and McCarthy are advocating will &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; cause more outbreaks of diseases like measles, Hib, pertussis, and mumps. The real health threat here is not vaccines, it’s the antivaccination movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240516879532"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6996">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7bb39402e91497a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 4.23</title><published>2009-04-23T19:00:17Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T19:00:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6996" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have a birthday coming up tomorrow. I’m over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m usually not one to make a fuss about birthdays, especially my own. I don’t think about it all that much. To me, it’s just another day. As long as I feel good, and as long as I can still spike a volleyball and paddle a surfboard, and as long as I still like looking at pretty girls, I figure everything’s working as it should, so my age doesn’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m wondering about you all and milestone ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My story is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turned 40, my friends and family all seemed touched by my milestone in some way. They all seemed to get some enjoyment out of the fact that I’m no longer the target demographic for most TV commercials. Many took peculiar delight that my yearly physicals now include strange exploratory procedures. Others pointed out that in just about any athletic competition, I easily qualify to participate in the &lt;strong&gt;Seniors&lt;/strong&gt; division. They found it interesting that I am now considered middle-aged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even these days, when I tell people how old I am, I get responses like, “Ooohhh . . . . ! Wow, I can’t believe you lived this long.” Or, “Jesus, you’re over 40? I hope I look as good as you when I’m so near death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my part though, I’m not really feeling it. I don’t feel any different than I did 8 or 9 years. And I say 8 or 9 years, because that was the last time I remember feeling any real change in my body. Things started to hurt that never hurt before, and they would hurt for a long time; knees, back, the occasional hip thing. But those aches and pains became a part of my life, just as I suppose being over 40 will. But for now, I don’t feel any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when I was kid, I’d see men who were approaching or passing 40 having these wonderful mid-life crises. They would buy themselves a tight pair of jeans and a frilly shirt, get a sports car, and start dating hot young women. It was all the rage. That’s the way they did it in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t know if that’s right for me either. I don’t really want a sports car, and I can’t stand tight jeans, but . . . . I guess the thing is, I don’t really have a buttoned-down life to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if I’m going to make something out of being over 40, and it seems everyone wants me to, I might as well take advantage of this dynamic, if I can. I might as well act the fool while I’ve got a free pass, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who let the old guy into the club?” people will say. “And can someone make him stop dancing like that? It’s very disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then someone else will remark, “Oh, it’s okay. He’s just having a mid-life crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you know it, the kids will have adopted me as sort of a mascot. I think I can make a mid-life crisis work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I’m not going to hit the dance clubs right away. I was thinking of starting slowly. Maybe to begin with, I’ll do something that’s not too far over the top. Perhaps a spanking new tattoo and a young stripper girlfriend, or something like that. I think that fits the bill nicely. Of course, I’ll have to stop using phrases like “spanking new”, otherwise I’ll never get a young stripper girlfriend. But I’m just brainstorming right now. I’m not ready to put the plan into action just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if my mid-life crisis doesn’t work out, there’s still good news for me and everyone else reaching two score in age. Newspapers and the Internet keep telling me that 40 is the new 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that, I thought &lt;em&gt;Wow, that’s pretty damn convenient. It’s perfect timing. I’m 40 just as 40 is becoming the new 30&lt;/em&gt;. And I can only assume that this trend will hold true for the rest of my life. When I turn 50, 50 will be the new 30, and then 60, and so on. Hell, I’m going to be 30 for the rest of my life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite my flippancy, I know that aging can be a hard fact of life. It’s a ticking reminder that we are here for just a short while. But I try not to let it bother me. The truth is, as long as I feel good and I have good people around me, I don’t care how old I am. I just hope to live my life well and be a good guy, no matter my age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course a cool tattoo and a hot, young stripper girlfriend wouldn’t really hurt anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just saying . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, have you had a mid-life crisis? And if you’re not there yet, do certain age milestones concern you? How do you celebrate them? How do you handle aging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240516514920"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72f94cf225c46cae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Public Health"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Vaccines"/><title type="html">J.B. Handley, Generation Rescue, and attacks on critics</title><published>2009-04-23T19:00:40Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T19:00:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because a colleague of mine has been attacked, specifically, our fearless leader Steve Novella. J.B. Handley, Founder of “&lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey’s Autism Organization - Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;” (whose usurpation by Jenny and Jim was apparently done in an opportunistic fashion but has had a consequence that must be galling to J.B., namely that some interviewers apparently think that Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, not J.B. and his wife, are the true founders of Generation Rescue), did not like something that Steve wrote and in his characteristic fashion, has responded with a vicious ad hominem attack. Normally I wouldn’t feel obligated to put my two cents in, as Steve is more than capable of taking care of himself in a scientific argument and quite able to refute anything J.B. can throw at him. Moreover, whenever J.B. Handley attacks someone in a fashion this nasty, it is an excellent indication that the person he is attacking has scored some serious points against him. Indeed, I have twice been on the receiving end of J.B.’s tirades on the Generation Propaganda blog Age of Autism. On one occasion, he referred to me as the “&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/05/david-gorski-md.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;worldwide wanker of woo&lt;/a&gt;,” and on another occasion seemed to think that I criticized Generation Rescue so harshly because I “&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/dr-david-gorski-and-his-merry-band-of-idiots-dont-like-full-page-ads.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;don’t like full page ads&lt;/a&gt;,” rather than because I hate pseudoscience and anti-vaccine nonsense. When criticism really hits a nerve with J.B. Handley, he lashes out in a characteristic fashion. Clearly Steve’s reasoned, level-headed criticism of the latest Generation Rescue anti-vaccine propaganda initiative did just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, I feel some explanation is in order because I feel a bit responsible for having brought J.B.’s wrath down upon Steve. First, a little history (albeit recent history) is in order. As I described in detail last week and the week before, Generation Rescue, with Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey at the fore, sometimes with J.B. himself, has mounted an impressive anti-vaccine propaganda effort. It started with a media tour promoting her most recent paean to anti-vaccine pseudoscience and autism quackery written with “co-author” Dr. Jerry Kartzinel. The book is entitled &lt;em&gt;Healing and Preventing Autism: A Complete Guide&lt;/em&gt;, and three weeks ago Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;showed up on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tout a truly incompetent and intellectually dishonest “study” that purported to find that U.S. children are the “most highly vaccinated children in the world” and that that’s correlated with our higher autism rates. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;I would have none of it&lt;/a&gt;. Next, Generation Rescue introduced its equally intellectually dishonest “&lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt;” website, which launched dubious attacks from pseudoexperts on fourteen of the major studies that failed to find a correlation between vaccines and autism or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;lengthy post for SBM&lt;/a&gt; describing the utter intellectual and scientific bankruptcy of the entire enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to go back a little further, J.B. and I have a bit of a history dating all the way back to when I first became interested in the antivaccine movement in 2005. This history, however, had played out entirely on my other blog, where as many readers here know, I blog under a pseudonym. Handley consistently thought that by “outing” me (as cranks as varied as &lt;a href="http://www.patsullivan.com/blog/2005/09/orac_unmasked_a.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;antivaccinationists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/david-h-gorski-do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do/" rel="nofollow"&gt;creationists&lt;/a&gt; had done before) he would somehow frighten me into silence. My persistence over four years shows how well that worked. In any case, we at SBM had discussed divvying up both the studies that Generation Rescue hated (the fourteen studies) and the highly dubious studies they liked, several of which I’ve discussed in detail, showing why they were so bad. As a part of this, Steve did a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459"&gt;followup post&lt;/a&gt; on one specific study, the one that is often referred to in the literature as the “Danish study,” that failed to find a correlation between mercury in vaccines and autism. Characteristically, Steve did an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the story gets interesting. One week after I posted my deconstruction of J.B. Handley’s “Fourteen Studies,” I reposted a modified version of the same post on my other blog. I explicitly did this as an experiment whose hypothesis was that J.B. would only attack my pseudonymous persona and would not attack me under my own name, because doing so would rob him of his ability to whine about my blogging under a pseudonym. Never mind that my pseudonym is perhaps the worst-kept secret in the medical/scientific blogosphere. (It also didn’t hurt that I was away at the AACR Meeting in Denver and needed some easy material because I didn’t have time to blog.) As predicted, J.B. didn’t bite at the first version. Also as predicted, he did show up in the other version, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell is wrong with your brain? Why is this such a hard concept for you to grasp? How did you get to be so stupid?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I predicted when I posted this, JB was a no show elsewhere but a show here. I wonder why. I also wonder why he didn’t also show up at Steve Novella’s takedown or the takedown published by a “friend” of the blog a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, JB, for confirming my hypothesis, though. I do appreciate it, and you are always welcome to comment here and on my “friend’s” blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, J.B. Handley launched a &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/dr-steven-novella-why-is-this-so-hard-to-understand.html"&gt;nasty personal attack on Steve on Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, the antivaccine propaganda blog, which appears to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation Rescue where J.B., along with his merry band of antivaccine zealots including David Kirby, Dan Olmsted, Kim Stagliano, and others, regularly blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now do you see why I feel a bit responsible? I suspect that my amused tweaking of J.B. led to his shifting his frustration to Steve, who is far nicer and more civil than I usually am when dealing with nonsense on the order of what Age of Autism and Generation Rescue regularly serve up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, though, I’m not worried that Steve couldn’t handle himself against a booster of pseudoscience like J.B. Steve was more than able to write a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;devastating response&lt;/a&gt; to J.B.’s attack that eviscerated his every point, and I can’t wait to see what the skeptical rogues on &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; will say about this. However, having had a bit more–shall we say?–history with J.B., certain aspects of his attack caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know Dr. Novella and I certainly having nothing against him personally, but I was stunned by the utter lack of knowledge and critical thinking that went into his critique of our new site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it amusing that apparently J.B. doesn’t read his own blog because last July Age of Autism &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/07/dear-dr-novella.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;published a response&lt;/a&gt; by Hannah Poling’s father Dr. Jon Poling to Steve’s discussion of the Hannah Poling case, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=341"&gt;to which Steve responded&lt;/a&gt;. It was actually a pretty big deal. Here’s a little hint to J.B. that I learned long ago blogging: Search your own blog for any person or topic you’re thinking of writing about to make see if you’ve addressed the topic or person before, and, if you did, what you or your coblogger said. Most amusing about this misstep, J.B.’s self-absorption is showing. Apparently if he hasn’t heard of someone (or has but forgot about him), that person is insignificant. Be that as it may, this passage, more than any other, boils down J.B.’s mindset. It’s pathognomonic of him and explain much about why he hates us “pointy-headed” scientists so much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not intellectually intimidated by any of these jokers. Their degrees mean zippo to me, because I knew plenty of knuckleheads in college who went on to be doctors, and they’re still knuckleheads (I also knew plenty of great, smart guys who went on to be doctors and they’re still great, smart guys).&lt;br&gt;
�&lt;br&gt;
I chose a different path and went into the business world. In the business world, having a degree from a great college or business school gets you your first job, and not much else. There are plenty of Harvard Business School grads who have bankrupted companies and gone to jail, and plenty of high school drop-outs who are multi-millionaires. Brains and street-smarts win, not degrees, arrogance, or entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, to J.B., it’s all about “elitism.” He honestly seems to believe that the reason the scientific community doesn’t accept his wild beliefs that vaccines cause autism is because of elitism and groupthink, not because the scientific evidence doesn’t support that belief. Unlike the case for scientists, it never occurs to him that he might be wrong or that the reason he is viewed with such disdain among scientists is because, well, he is wrong. But not just wrong, spectacularly and arrogantly wrong about the science. As both Steve and I have pointed out, it is the &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=140"&gt;arrogance of ignorance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. also clearly doesn’t understand the nature of academic medicine and science. He seems to think it’s some sort of cushy ivory tower where a Ph.D. guarantees one a career. He’s so wrong on this one that he is, as they say, “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong"&gt;not even wrong&lt;/a&gt;.” However, as I am in a benevolent mood, I’ll educate J.B. a bit on what it takes to be a academic faculty at a major university. First off, a Ph.D. (or an M.D.) doesn’t guarantee anything. Making a parallel to the business world, sure, it helps to have a Ph.D. from a good school. It’ll help to get a good postdoctoral position. However, once you’re in your postdoc, no one really gives a rodent’s posterior where you went to school, and, if you’re an M.D., once you’re in your residency, no one cares anymore where you graduated from medical school. They really don’t. All they care about is how well you do where you are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, science is every bit as Darwinian a career as business, with the exception that the rewards are not financial, nor is a scientists’s worth measured by money, which appears to be the be-all and end-all for how J.B. views success, given his remark about millionaires. After fighting to get into a good Ph.D. program, a freshly minted scientist needs to fight to get a good postdoc. Once there, he has to produce. He has to demonstrate his worth by doing good science and publishing in good journals. Then, because obtaining an entry-level faculty position has become intensely competitive, a new Ph.D. often needs to do two or even three two- to three-year postdocs in order to amass enough of a track record to entice a university to take a chance on him with a lab and a startup package. Finally, once a new scientist has a faculty position, he has in general around three or four years to obtain independent research funding to cover at least 50% of his salary  as a condition of tenure, or he will be fired and have to start all over again looking for a new faculty position, which will be harder to find after having failed to gain tenure at one institution. Worse, over the last few years, getting that initial grant has become harder than ever. In the past, scientists who failed to gain tenure often ended up working for pharma, but in the current climate pharma has been downsizing. There now exists an underclass of underemployed Ph.D. scientists, who may be poorly paid adjunct professors with no hope of any permanent work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see: Get funded in three or four years or get fired to face a highly uncertain fate. That sounds pretty hardcore to me. I will admit that it’s easier for academic physicians in that they can always return to practicing medicine if they fail, but will no longer have a lab. I will grant that, once a scientist obtains tenure, things are easier in that he can’t be easily fired, but, trust me, if a scientist doesn’t produce and loses funding, he will find himself in a world of hurt. Schools have ways of making such faculty’s lives so miserable that they end up quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. also doesn’t understand the culture of science at the faculty level, either. Once someone becomes a full scientist and obtains an academic position, no one cares where he or she went to school, where he did his postdoc, or where he did his residency. Really. No one does. All they care about is whether that person does good science, publishes good science, and can get his or her science funded. In this, science and medicine are a lot like the business world that J.B. waxes so rhapsodic about. J.B. is also wrong to think that “street smarts” should win in science. They don’t necessarily, because what matters is doing good science. The scientific method is a systematized method of minimizing human bias and error, whereas “street smarts” are, all too often, all about hunches. Hunches can be valuable in science, but only as a first step. If a hunch isn’t supported by scientific evidence, it is worthless, and scientists will discard it. It may not happen as fast as we like; it may be messier than we like; but eventually it will happen. That’s the difference between scientists and J.B. Handley. No matter how cherished our hunches are, we do consider the possibility that they may be wrong, and eventually we can be persuaded that they are wrong if the evidence is strong enough. Indeed, this is perhaps the most ignorant thing J.B. said in his attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been astonished by the culture of arrogance and elitism that medical schools appear to breed in their doctors and scientists. The culture tends to produce an “us vs. them” mentality, where doctors collectively back each other up on controversial issues, typically without understanding the issue for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. really hasn’t seen how cut-throat scientific arguments can be. Moreover, science actually does reward overthrowing the existing paradigm. Look at the list of Nobel Prize winners. You won’t find anyone there who won that prize because he or she simply confirmed pre-existing scientific dogma. Believe me, if a scientists provided compelling scientific evidence that vaccines or mercury in vaccines do cause autism and could show how they do it, that scientist would be instantly famous and a serious contender for a Nobel Prize. In any case, clearly the accusation of “arrogance” against J.B. really stings him. However, what else should we call it when someone, without any knowledge or training, blithely rejects the findings of science and labels them all a vast conspiracy to “hide the truth”? Or when someone thinks his “street smarts” trumps the accumulated knowledge of science thus far? Arrogance doesn’t begin to describe such an attitude, and only a lack of understanding of science could have produced this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On of the most fascinating aspects of the autism epidemic is how the mainstream health community seems to get away with a stunning paradox: they are so damn smart that they are certain as to what doesn’t cause autism, but they haven’t a clue as to what does. How can that be? Why aren’t the smarts being applied to finding the cause?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing more than the classic logical fallacy of an appeal to ignorance. In other words, to J.B. because scientists don’t really know what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; cause autism, then his pet view that vaccines cause autism must be plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my having dealt with J.B. online on and off for four years, one thing that’s become clear to me is that he does not understand science. He thinks he does, but he does not. He has made up his mind about vaccines and autism and is not open to evidence falsifying his belief. That is inimical to the culture of science, which is always testing scientific dogma versus reality and discarding what doesn’t line up with the evidence. With few exceptions, even the most dogmatic of scientists can be persuaded if the evidence is strong enough. In contrast, Mr. Handley clearly views science as a tool to support his conclusions and an enemy when it does not. Moreover, viewing the vaccine-autism pseudoscience through the prism of a businessman’s viewpoint, rather than a scientist’s viewpoint, to him it’s a propaganda battle to win, not a scientific question to answer. Like any good businessman, he has a product to sell, and sell it he does, using all the tools of Madison Avenue pitch men at his disposal. It doesn’t matter to him if the product is a lemon; he needs to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the entire culture at the Age of Autism is an increasingly paranoid echo chamber. Just look at some of the comments there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Novella buries his nose in literature, but he fails to recognize the political backstories that skewed the studies. And he hasn’t had face time — or G.I. time — with any kids on the autism spectrum. His selective ignorance is not only arrogant, it’s life-threatening. (&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/dr-steven-novella-why-is-this-so-hard-to-understand.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201156f47b204970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201156f47b204970c" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nancy Hokkanen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novella is part of the HealthFraud crowd, started by Barrett who was the cover for the AMA when its dirty tricks dept had to go underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what sort of operation is going on it would help to study the COINTRELPRO operation of the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment “including the Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, The American Medical Association, the Institute of Medicine, and the March of Dimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is just the old authority ploy, or ‘lying with the truth’. Blair was the master, of course. (&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/dr-steven-novella-why-is-this-so-hard-to-understand.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20115703de773970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e20115703de773970b"&gt;john&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, my favorite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novella, I believe, is one of the members of the “Quackwatch,” along with Gorski (aka Orac, aka Dirtbag, aka whoever knows how many other aliases he hides behind), Probert (aka TheProbe, aka Freespeaker), Kevin Leitch, and numerous others. I find it deliciously ironic that they claim to be a group of people concerned about quackery in all of its forms (and, they even have the cute little “superhero” names to prove it), and they are the biggest quacks of them all! (&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/dr-steven-novella-why-is-this-so-hard-to-understand.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20115703d9902970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e20115703d9902970b"&gt;Craig Willoughby&lt;/a&gt;, who has abandoned any prior pretense of rationality.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the adoration of my fans, much as, I suspect, Steve does. Word to Craig: I don’t have any other aliases than the two you know about. I’m also terribly, terribly hurt that you consider me a “dirtbag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented these examples to show just how inimical to science the entire Age of Autism crew is. If science doesn’t jibe with their beliefs, then everyone who criticizes them is part of some huge conspiracy by The Man (in the form of the CDC, AAP, big pharma, and the government) to suppress The Truth. Personally, I often joke that I wish there were such a conspiracy, because I want in on some of that filthy big pharma lucre for doing what I would do anyway: Writing about pseudoscience and quackery. Maybe I could even quit my day job and sit around in my shorts all day blogging. Alas, it is not to be, and I have to blog in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I feel rather sorry for J.B. Sure, he’s rich. Sure, he gets to pal around with celebrities these days. However, he labors under the delusion that vaccines caused his child’s autism and that various forms of “biomedical therapy” (a.k.a. autism quackery) will cure it. He may never believe me when I say this, but it would actually be fantastic if scientists could find so obvious and simple a cause of autism as vaccines; if that were the case, doctors could change their practice to correct the problem. That’s what we do when we find out that a treatment is causing harm. Moreover, if all the dubious “biomedical” interventions actually worked, it would mean that scientists would have a huge leg up in figuring out what the cause of autism is; they do not, and so scientists do not, and doctors still have only limited options of relatively weak efficacy for treating autistic children. Worse, J.B. is in the position to do so much good for autistic children, but instead he chooses to use his wealth and business savvy to promote pseudoscience that is not just harmful to autistic children, but potentially harmful to all children through its discouragement of vaccination and the increasing risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases that follow from his antivaccine activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more telling is J.B. reaction to criticism. In the case of Steve he relies primarily on ad hominems and distortions. In the case of me, he’s utterly ignored my criticisms of his “Fourteen Studies” website, at least not those written under my own name. Whether it’s because he doesn’t want to give me the satisfaction of responding or because he’s embarrassed at realizing that he’s behaved exactly as I had publicly predicted, I don’t know. In any case, rather than addressing actual substantive criticisms, he routinely chooses to lash out at critics when they score direct hits on his nonsense, digging any dirt he can at the University of Google and slinging the mud far and wide. That should tell you all you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that, unlike so many ‘regulatory bodies’, it may actually take its responsibilities seriously. The following announcement has &lt;a href="http://www.nutritionsociety.org/node/36"&gt;appeared on their web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists acts to protect the public and the reputation the nutrition profession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 4th 2009, a Fitness to Practice Panel was convened to consider an allegation against a registrant, Dr Ann Walker, that her fitness to practise was impaired. The panel considered whether the registrant, in advocating the use of a web based personal nutritional profiling service had complied with the Code of Ethics’ clause 3: This expects all registered nutritionists to “maintain the highest standards of professionalism and scientific integrity”.  In particular,  the panel considered whether the registrant showed “knowledge, skills and performance of high quality, up-to-date, and relevant to their field of practice”, in keeping with the Statement of Professional Conduct (para 9). The Panel accepted the allegation of impaired fitness to practice. Mindful of its duty to protect the public, it recommended that Dr Walker be removed from the register. Dr Walker has a right of appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. well, this must be none other than the Dr Ann Walker who caused UCL,and me, such trouble a few years ago.  And just because I described her use of the word “blood cleanser” as gobbledygook.  She has appeared a few times on this blog.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably the “web-based  personal nutritional profiling service” that is referred to is Nutriprofile, on which, with the help of a dietition, we had a bit of fun a while ago.  However ideal your diet it still recommended at the end of the questionnaire that you should buy some expensive supplements.  Read about it at &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=221"&gt;Nutriprofile: useful aid or sales scam?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea who lodged the complaint (but it wasn’t me). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to compare the high standards of the Nutrition Society with the quite different standards of BANT (the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy).  They bill themselves as the “Professional Body for Nutritional Therapists”.  Nutritional therapists are those fantasists who believe you can cure any ill by buying some supplement pills. Their standards can be judged by, for example, &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2008/04/07/bant-ethics-code-bant-nutritional-therapists-are-allowed-to-earn-commission-from-selling-pills-and-tests/"&gt;BANT ethics code: BANT nutritional therapists are allowed to earn commission from selling pills and tests&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It seems Dr Ann Walker may have joined the wrong society.  &lt;/p&gt;

This, of course, is not my view, but there's enough other stuff in there to stir up controversy that maybe we'll stir up a contentious  audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, apparently, an intelligent design creationism proponent on the faculty of Southern Oregon University, and they got a few comments from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Roger Christianson said there are alternative explanations of how diversity happened, and "people who believe in intelligent design feel the complexity of life is too great to come about by naturalistic forces."
&lt;p&gt;
Christianson, an evangelical Christian, said he has brought up intelligent design and creation science in class to show the swing of the pendulum between the two schools of thought, and "I suggest the truth is somewhere in the middle."
&lt;/p&gt;
"I talk mostly about adaptation that can be seen from either point of view," he said. "... I see the world as an evolving pot, with natural selection as the driving force, but I certainly don't rule out that an intelligence or a creator is involved."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charming. Of course, my talk tonight is &lt;i&gt;specifically&lt;/i&gt; a counter to that silly and ignorant notion that the fact that organisms are complex must imply that they were designed. And no, there aren&amp;#39;t two schools of thought: there are religious kooks on one side, and the scientific evidence on the other…and only in the minds of the deluded is the correct answer &amp;quot;somewhere in the middle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience tells me, though, that Professor Christianson will be nowhere near my talk tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/interviewed_in_the_medford_mai.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/mZj7ME1_EYU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240513125927"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3775">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9b45cd47a1f3362</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="aptonyms"/><title type="html">If I Change My Name to Millionaire, Will I Win the Lottery?</title><published>2009-04-23T18:39:56Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T18:39:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/if-i-change-my-name-to-millionaire-will-i-win-the-lottery/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We've said it many times before: your name is not your destiny.

&lt;p&gt;It's yet another transitional fossil, everyone! Oooh and aaah over it, and laugh when the creationists scramble to pave it over with excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have is a 23 million year old mammal from the Canadian arctic that would have looked rather like a seal in life…with a prominent exception. &lt;i&gt;No flippers&lt;/i&gt;, instead having very large feet that were probably webbed. This is a walking seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/pujila_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/pujila.jpeg" width="400" height="387" alt="pujila.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;a, Palatal view of skull; b, lateral view of skull and mandible, left side; c, occlusal view of left mandible. Stippling represents matrix, hatching represents broken bone surface. The images are of three-dimensional scans. The brain case was scanned using computed tomography, whereas all other elements were surface scanned.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it tells us is that marine pinnipeds almost certainly had an origin in the arctic, derived from terrestrial and semi-aquatic forms — these were more otter-like animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll want to learn more about this beautiful creature. There is a &lt;a href="http://nature.ca/puijila/"&gt;website all about &lt;i&gt;Puijila&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (in English, French, and Inuktitut) where you can find all kinds of images…and you can also find out how to &lt;a href="http://nature.ca/puijila/fb_an_e.cfm"&gt;pronounce "&lt;i&gt;Puijila&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;, something we're all going to have to practice. Who knew paleontology was going to lead us all into learning a few words of Inuktitut?&lt;/p&gt;

The Ways and Means Committee of Oregon is considering a number of horrific budget cuts to developmental disabilities programs in the state, including several programs I use.  A full list of the horror can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.oregonddcoalition.org/files/Proposed%20Reductions%20in%20Services%20to%20People%20with%20Developmental%20Disabilities.doc"&gt;this document (DOC)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I should have been writing a blog post I was instead writing a testimony, specifically on behalf of the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oregon.gov%2FDHS%2Fdd%2Fadults%2Fsupports.shtml&amp;amp;ei=MVnvSeSUM6iEtAPwpfjpAQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEyLPLubzhwoEMkcDn_aCaVIdjWog&amp;amp;sig2=ECoBKg2lXbWa0xaLRv_j1g"&gt;brokerages&lt;/a&gt; (there were other self-advocates covering other items).  As everything about this is relevant to this blogspace, here's a recording of my testimony (if the plugin doesn't work here's a &lt;a href="http://doraraymaker.com/aud/ways_and_means.mp3"&gt;direct link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://doraraymaker.com/aud/ways_and_means.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen any press on the hearing yet, but so many people showed up that the fire marshal had to open an overflow room.  Over 200 people signed up to testify, and only about a quarter actually got called on (I was one who did not get called on).  While it's bad not everyone was heard, the sheer numbers perhaps communicated the message just as well: a lot of people will be severely effected by these cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Oregon and wish to attend the Ways and Means hearings to make sure that critical funding for DD programs remains intact, there are still more hearings to come.  Full information can be found from the &lt;a href="http://www.oregonddcoalition.org/node/366"&gt;Oregon DD Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript of my speech behind the more cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Dora Raymaker.  I am on the board of directors of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and a member of Self Advocates as Leaders.  I am an autistic adult, and a brokerage customer, although the latter only recently.  I have spent most of my life in a vicious cycle of crash and crisis, working myself into catatonia, then recovering just enough to start again.  I have been in this cycle because I have not had good support.  I am getting old and am unlikely to survive the next crash.  At that point the state will need to pay 100% for me to live, or I will become homeless and probably not survive.  I would like to avoid this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash and crisis cycles from lack of adequate support are enormously costly physically and emotionally to the people who experience them, and also financially as crisis services are exponentially more expensive than non-crisis services.  As opposed to spending a small amount of money to avoid the crisis in the first place.  Which is, happily, what services like the brokerage system do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting non-crisis services like the brokerages not only deprives people with developmental disabilities of hope for a reasonable quality of life and staying out of crisis, it deprives the people who provide those services of their means of making a living.  For every brokerage client, there is also an entire brokerage staff, as well as the people who brokerage clients hire with their money.  In Multnomah county alone, non-crisis services provide 68 million dollars per year to the local economy through jobs, wages, and the purchase of services and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freezing brokerage services will put the over 1400 transition age people and their families slated to receive services in the next two years at immediate risk of crisis.  Reducing brokerage services will put the 5000 plus young adults and adults who currently receive brokerage services at immediate risk of crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the brokerage supports I now receive finally break the crash and crisis cycle, and enable me to contribute meaningfully to my community?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That depends on whether the state chooses to fund the programs that will help keep me out of a crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the 1400 developmentally disabled Oregon children who will receive brokerage services in the next two years be given a chance at a real quality of life, a better chance than I have gotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That depends on whether the state chooses to fund the brokerage services for those children.  &lt;br&gt;
Will. you. the Ways and Means Committee of Oregon, be able to make wise budget cut decisions?  &lt;br&gt;
That depends on whether the big picture, and the full consequences of cuts in both health and finance, is considered, seriously, first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240506545699"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9141">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3b0c33c5aae39bb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="The Economist"/><title type="html">Why There's Only One Economist</title><published>2009-04-23T17:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T17:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/why-theres-only-one-economist/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">With the magazine industry in bad shape, newsweeklies are trying to imitate the one freakishly successful exception: The Economist.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are bills going through the process of creation (haha) in the Lone Star State that could strip the State Board of Education of its powers to warp the minds of children with creationism. &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/14/reckoning-approaches-for-state-ed-board/"&gt;Incredibly, too, the effort is bipartisan&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m hearing rumors that the extremely awful BoE chair, avowed creationist Don McLeroy, &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/is-mcleroys-confirmation-in-trouble/"&gt;is having some trouble&lt;/a&gt; at his confirmation hearing to be re-upped as the Board’s top Denier of Reality. Gee, that’s too bad. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/please_texas_make_don_mcleroy.php"&gt;PZ comments on this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/live-blogging-the-mcleroy-hearing/"&gt;the Texas Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt; has this priceless quote from the dentist-cum-evangelist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My purpose has never been religious indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Now we can add &amp;quot;liar&amp;quot; to his list of adjectives. I am loathe to use that word unless there is strong evidence, but that’s the biggest whopper I’ve heard in a long, long time. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy?s=mcleroy"&gt;He has done &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; but try to wedge creationism into the state standards while weakening real science&lt;/a&gt;. So, in fact, religious indoctrination is &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; what his purpose is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texans: you may wish to contact call your legislators. In reality there’s probably little chance McLeroy will be tossed out — Texas politics generally have little enough to do with the voters — but this is as good a chance as you’re likely to get.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240504830603"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/ucla_pro-test_a_success.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b2a6886c3ab64c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Animal Rights"/><title type="html">UCLA Pro-Test a success</title><published>2009-04-23T17:19:22Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T17:19:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/fPpWQB4GupM/ucla_pro-test_a_success.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/ucla_pro-test_a_success.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hope you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/support_the_ucla_pro-test_tomo.php" title=""&gt;got educated&lt;/a&gt; before the UCLA Pro-Test yesterday.

Just now a press release came across my desk: &lt;a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200904/1240338696.html"&gt;Discover the Answer to Dyslexia&lt;/a&gt;, in which the writer claims:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Breakthrough research by Ronald D. Davis, author of the internationally acclaimed book, The Gift of Dyslexia, indicates that dyslexia is not a malfunction of the brain, eyes, or ears - it is a compound of simple factors which can be dealt with step by step.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What a load of hooey.  No serious dyslexia researcher claims that dyslexia is a malfunction of sight or hearing.  To simplify: the neurological understanding of reading is that reading is a complex symphony of brain subsystems.  Problems arise when the precise harmony among the subsystems breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ldblog.com/2009/04/09/davis-goes-on-tour/"&gt;In his post&lt;/a&gt;, Lloyd reviews the weak evidence to date for the Davis method, and writes,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that people will ask questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the scientific basis for the assertion that individuals with dyslexia think in pictures, that “dyslexia is a result of perceptual talent” (Davis, 1997, p. 6)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What scientifically rigorous evidence do you have that there is a higher incidence of giftedness among individuals with dyslexia than among the general popultion? How is the relative degree of giftedness determined in your view?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What plans do you have to subject your methods to rigorous field trials of their effects on student’s reading, spelling, and writing outcomes? Would you be willing to provide free materials and training for scores of randomly selected teachers in a comparison with two or three compehensive reading instructional programs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Someone you know and read will be on it. &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/naked-science/3899/Overview#tab-Videos/06630_00"&gt;Here’s a preview&lt;/a&gt; (an ad plays for 18 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening few seconds are funny; that must be the tail end of the Niagara Falls footage we shot, and they put it in the clip because of the voiceover segue. We filmed that in November, and it was about -8 Celsius outside… and the first thing in the morning we did: a helicopter ride. Standing on Canadian ground at 08:00 in subfreezing weather with a 60 kph wind in my face from the rotor chop was a tad unpleasant, but the I’m hoping the footage we got was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3468638078/sizes/l/in/set-72157617130394057/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3468638078_8b7880ea82_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have lots of other footage I shot myself (hmmm, literally in one case) I’ll post soon with some back story.

This allows me to share with the world all of the deep insights, amusing trifles, and enlightening links that are just too short to fit into a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has not escaped my attention that the world is filled with grumpy old people (of all ages) who take great joy in mocking the mode of superficial sound-bite communication that Twitter embodies.  Usually this mockery is broadcast by means of their blogs or Facebook accounts, which … well, I’ll let you finish the thought.  (Some of it will be broadcast, I hereby predict, in the comment section attached to this post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going to let it pass when our wonderful new bloggy neighbor Sheril took the time to explain in great detail why she &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/14/twitter-nation/"&gt;disapproves of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.  Different strokes, and all that.  But then she went a step too far:  she &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/22/maureen-dowd-on-a-toy-for-bored-celebrities-and-high-school-girls/"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/opinion/22dowd.html?_r=2&amp;amp;th&amp;amp;emc=th"&gt;column by Maureen Dowd&lt;/a&gt;, and described it as “terrific.”  Oh Sheril, how could you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some excerpts from Ms. Dowd’s foray into honest reportage — the probing queries she asked during her interview with the founders of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was here on a simple quest: curious to know if the inventors of Twitter were as annoying as their invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: Did you know you were designing a toy for bored celebrities and high-school girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: If you were out with a girl and she started twittering about it in the middle, would that be a deal-breaker or a turn-on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: Do you ever think “I don’t care that my friend is having a hamburger?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: Why did you think the answer to e-mail was a new kind of e-mail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: Why did you call the company Twitter instead of Clutter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: Was there anything in your childhood that led you to want to destroy civilization as we know it?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess these are the kinds of questions they’re teaching people to ask in Serious Journalism school these days.  (The answers were a lot more polite than I would have been.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-Twitter crowd always hastens to explain that they are not, really, grumpy old Luddite curmudgeons.  The reason why it’s necessary to make this point is, of course, because they are all grumpy old Luddite curmudgeons.  And here’s how we know:  a little-appreciated feature of the Twitter technology is that it’s completely optional!  You don’t have to get involved.  It’s okay, really.  Nobody is forcing you.  Now, when there is something new going around that nobody is forcing you to be involved with, there are a couple of possible non-curmudgeonly responses.  One is:  ignore it completely.  Nothing wrong with that.  Another is:  give it a try, decide whether or not you like it; if so, your happiness has been marginally improved, and if not, leave and get on with your life.  Simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is one quintessentially curmudgeonly response:  don’t try it, but take valuable time out of your day explaining to other people why they shouldn’t be enjoying it, either.  The only difference between that and yelling “Get off my lawn!” is — well, there isn’t any difference, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Twitter is mildly amusing for three minutes a day.  Could take it or leave it, really.  But it’s nice to get science links from the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TelegraphScienc"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;, updates on Penn State’s spring practice from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/JayPaterno"&gt;Jay Paterno&lt;/a&gt;, Senate gossip from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/clairecmc"&gt;Claire McCaskill&lt;/a&gt;, peeks at the Iron Man II set from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Jon_Favreau"&gt;Jon Favreau&lt;/a&gt;, breathless scoops from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Roland_Hedley"&gt;Roland Hedley&lt;/a&gt;, or reassurances of continued insanity from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;.  I find it interesting, but that’s me.  Again:  completely optional!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest substantive complaint is that we have become a society of over-sharers, and one simply doesn’t want to be continually updated about what people had for dinner.  Again:  fine!  Just don’t subscribe to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/1589760218"&gt;Newt Gingrich’s feed&lt;/a&gt;.  But the claim that Twitter is nothing but mindless inanities is just as wrong as the analogous claim for blogs — in fact it’s precisely the same claim, five years later.  There are other things you can do with the technology — the technical terms are “lifecasting” [here’s what I had for dinner] vs. “mindcasting” [here’s a thought, a question, an observation, a link to something more substantial].  And if someone else really does want to know what their friends are having for dinner, why should you be so bothered?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is not very important, on the cosmic scale of things.  It’s just a fun little gadget.  But it’s a small part of something very important:  a &lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2009/04/14/fear-of-twitter-technophobia-part-2/"&gt;changing information landscape&lt;/a&gt; that enables &lt;a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-other-half-writes-in-defense-of.html"&gt;new kinds of communication&lt;/a&gt;.  (That link via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/physicsdavid/status/1588594886"&gt;David Harris’s Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.)  Nobody has any idea what that landscape is going to look like twenty years from now, but it’s interesting to watch it evolve.  Not that anyone is forcing you to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
Recently, I was amazed to hear a commentary by CNN&amp;#39;s Campbell Brown on the controversial vaccine issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The &amp;quot;vaccine issue&amp;quot; is only controversial to a small, well-funded, fringe element -- called by some the&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/laws-of-internet-discussion-announcing-oracs-law.html"&gt; Society to Promote Vaccine-Preventable Diseas&lt;/a&gt;e -- represented by J. B. Handley&amp;#39;s Generation Rescue and its celebrity mouthpieces Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey. The weight of the scientific evidence is that the current vaccine schedule is both effective in preventing disease and safe--as free as possible of side-effects.. 


Carrey wrote:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
The truth is that no one without a vested interest in the profitability of vaccines has studied all 36 of them in depth. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Setting aside the first inflammatory phrase, let us look at the last phrase: the &amp;quot;36 vaccines&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Shall we count?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Looking at the 2009 &lt;em&gt;recommended&lt;/em&gt; inoculations for children from birth to ages (available for free download from &lt;a href="http://www.cispimmunize.org/"&gt;http://www.cispimmunize.org/&lt;/a&gt;), I count 14 diseases:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rotavirus&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diphtheria&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tetanus&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pertussis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pneumococcal&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Polio&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Influenza&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Measles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mumps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rubella&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Varicella&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hepatitis A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Carrey is (a) parroting the Generation Rescue line (b) exaggerating (babies!  36 vaccines!! dangerous!!!),  (c) cannot make an accurate count or (d) some combination of the previous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual number of injections is more difficult to calculate, since (a) each disease requires a different number of injections for complete coverage and (b)  there are various combination vaccine preparations that can be administered. Additionally, an annual influenza vaccination is recommended (which seems to be included in the &amp;quot;36 vaccines&amp;quot;)  but it is not clear what the uptake rate is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hear &amp;quot;36 vaccines&amp;quot;, you know you are listening to a card-carrying member of the Society
to Promote Vaccine-Preventable Disease.  Just remember: 14 diseases,
some of which take more than two injections for full protection from
disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240494333110"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/whats_the_financial_crisis_got.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36c3b558e908da55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Homeownership"/><title type="html">What's The Financial Crisis Got To Do With Me?</title><published>2009-04-23T13:20:15Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T13:20:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/-cpzHEKzC94/whats_the_financial_crisis_got.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/whats_the_financial_crisis_got.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a scholar working in an abstruse subject I live a life largely divorced from what concerns most people. We have no newspaper subscription. I really don't have much of a clue. But I am aware of the poor state of the world economy. Now, how has it affected me so far?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only effect of the financial crisis on my life that I am aware of is that the mortgage my wife and I took out in December is absurdly cheap. We currently pay less per month to live in a 114 sqm house than we did last year to live in a 80 sqm apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, it seems the crisis will have both good and bad effects for me. On one hand, the foundations that fund my research are likely to have less money than usual to dole out over the following years. On the other hand, the slump will prompt the government to invest in roads and railroads, which will create archaeological job opportunities, and it will lead to unemployment in other sectors, which will prompt the government to invest in the university system to keep the kids off the streets, which will create further job opportunities for scholars in abstruse subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm not really bothered by the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

Or late night shopping, or something else that involves human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I trawl the internet searching for people who are “wrong” and need to be told so. And so it was, that during a search for Dr Peter Ford on ABC &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/adelaide/radio/?nav=true"&gt;Adelaide local radio &lt;/a&gt; I was pleasantly surprised (okay reader, I did let out an eeeep!) to find a picture of my Dad on the front page of the website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:374px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3438330518_23d8ae05ce.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="3438330518_23d8ae05ce" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/3438330518_23d8ae05ce.jpg" alt="The proud Dunlops, L-R Sally, Moi, Moose and Minnie" width="364" height="273"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proud Dunlops, L-R Sally, Moi, Moose and Minnie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead up to Anzac Day, Dad has done an interview for local ABC radio entitled “Soldiers of Misfortune” detailing his experiences in the Vietnam War and his subsequent fight for the entitlements of veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may recall his work with veterans contributed to him being &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/01/26/my-dad-moose-oam/"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; an Order of Australia medal on Australia Day, 2009. You can see a transcript of the interview, or hear the audio &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/04/21/2548547.htm?site=adelaide&amp;amp;rotator=true"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended Da’s investiture for his Order of Australia medal at Government House in Adelaide last month. It was a formal affair, only interrupted by the clearly audible “well done Moose!” from &lt;a href="http://www.governor.sa.gov.au/index.php?m=biography-of-the-governor-and-mrs-scarce"&gt;His Excellency Rear Admiral Governor Kevin Scarce&lt;/a&gt; whilst pinning the medal to Da’s proud breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This somewhat insignificant comment has more relevance when you know that Da requested his medal be engraved with “Moose” but the “powers that be” deemed it unsuitable. (He was cited in the programme however as Lt. Col. Graham “Moose” Dunlop). I have to admit I did let out a little chuckle when this was heard to echo around the plush surrounds of Government house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I almost burst with pride. Congratulations Da.&lt;/p&gt;

An article in the Boston Globe  ("&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/04/craigslist_ceo.html"&gt;Craiglist CEO: Our site is not sex-related&lt;/a&gt;", 4/22/2009) quotes him as telling CNN that "We feel terribly, and it's quite sad that anyone would lose their life". To which &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mulshine"&gt;Paul Mulshine&lt;/a&gt;, a syndicated columnist for the New Jersey Star-Ledger, responded "&lt;a href="http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2009/04/no_you_feel_terrible_you_merel.html"&gt;No, you feel terrible; you merely speak terribly&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Mulshine, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt; in this case is what he calls a "linking verb", which is followed not by an adverb but by a "predicate adjective", describing "not the action of the predicate but the condition of the subject". He calls Mr. Buckmaster's usage a "hypercorrectionism", caused by "some time-server of a teacher" who warned "little Jimmy" against leaving the -ly off of adverbs, but "never got around to explaining the role of a predicate adjective".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1350#comment-30184"&gt;inattentive reader&lt;/a&gt; who accused this weblog of an irrational "crusade against 'prescriptivism'" may be surprised to find that (some details of terminology aside) I largely agree with Mulshine. The expected standard form really is "We feel terrible", and "We feel terribly" is probably a hypercorrection, a violation of the norms of standard English caused by a misguided attempt to apply a misunderstood "rule" about what those norms should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Mulshine's main argument for this analysis is an appeal to the authority of "the nuns [who taught] me when I was a young lad". With all due respect to his teachers, a better form of argument emerges from a careful descriptive analysis of the relevant areas of English usage. In the time available to me now, I'll just sketch the main outlines of such an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, let's establish that the normal pattern really is &lt;em&gt;feel &amp;lt;adjective&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Dombey and Son&lt;/em&gt;, Charles Dickens wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It was hard work, resuming his studies, soon after dinner; and he felt giddy and confused and drowsy and dull.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;*It was hard work, resuming his studies, soon after dinner; and he felt giddily and confusedly and drowsily and dully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt;, Herman Melville wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But my being so angry prevented me from feeling foolish, which is very lucky for people in a passion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;*But my being so angry prevented me from feeling foolishly, which is very lucky for people in a passion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index at Literature Online finds 22 hits for the search pattern "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] foolish". There are 2 hits for "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] foolishly", but both are cases where the adverb modifies a following predicative adjective: "I feel foolishly afraid" and "I felt foolishly conscious of my wandering moods".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are 21 hits for the search pattern "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] drowsy", and the single hit for  "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] drowsily" is again a case where the adverb modifies a predicative adjective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;322   … she felt it suck,&lt;br&gt;
323   And, as the little lips drew forth the milk,&lt;br&gt;
324   Felt drowsily resign'd, and closed her eyes,&lt;br&gt;
325   And trembled, and could feel the happy tears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results will be similar for nearly all cases of apparent adjective/adverb choice in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the argument that Mr. Buckmaster's usage was a hypercorrection rather than merely a variant of some other kind? Well, there's no general standard-English pattern for using adverbs to express how the subject of &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; feels, as the discussion above indicates. And as discussed in my post "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004231.html"&gt;Amid this vague uncertainty, who walks safe?&lt;/a&gt;", 2/23/2007, there's definitely an ill-informed prescriptivist prejudice against predicative adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there's one common case that's more complex, and may have played a causal role in Mr. Buckmaster's choice of phrasing. If we query LION with "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] bad" vs. "[feel | felt | feeling | feels] badly", the first pattern gets 174 hits, while the second gets 69. Of the 69, a few are things like " I began to feel badly confused" or "And respectable citizens feel badly let doon", but most are like "George, I feel badly. Get me some whiskey" or "Mrs. Hobbs, who felt badly about her brother's treachery, yielded to my entreaties".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that for some stems, &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; allows an adverbial rather than an adjectival form to express the meaning that is usually expressed by a following predicative adjective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED lists two relevant senses for &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt;. The first is given as sense 9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; orig. &lt;em&gt;U.S.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to feel badly&lt;/strong&gt;: to feel guilty, regretful, or sorry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest citation for this form is from the early 19th century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1825&lt;/strong&gt; W. S. CARDELL &lt;em&gt;Story of Jack Halyard&lt;/em&gt; (ed. 3) iii. 30 When Mr Halyard came home, they told him what had been done. He felt badly, but did not say much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this sense is listed as an adverb, note that the gloss relates it to three predicative adjectives; also note that the use is limited to an idiomatic combination with &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, so that you couldn't say "he seems badly" meaning "he seems guilty, regretful, or sorry".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second relevant OED sub-entry is the adjectival form of &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt;, which is attested back to the 17th century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;adj.&lt;/em&gt; (chiefly &lt;em&gt;predicative&lt;/em&gt;).    Chiefly &lt;em&gt;Sc. &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Eng. regional. &lt;/em&gt;Unwell, in ill health; = POORLY &lt;em&gt;adj.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1654 &lt;/strong&gt;H. MORE&lt;em&gt; Let.&lt;/em&gt; 1 May in &lt;em&gt;Conway Lett.&lt;/em&gt; (1992) ii. 96 As for the Physick..I took it 3 pills a day for 4 dayes together, and was something weake after it and looked badly [for] it, as they tell me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1766&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Decisions Court of Session&lt;/em&gt; (Faculty of Advocates) (1777) IV. 81, I am taken badly, and know not but it may be death.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1779&lt;/strong&gt; J. WARNER in J. H. Jesse &lt;em&gt;G. Selwyn &amp;amp; his Contemp.&lt;/em&gt; (1844) IV. 259, I called upon the old duchess, who is ‘sorely badly’, as they say in Lincolnshire, with her old complaint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative analysis of this is that there's an old adjectival form &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; (like &lt;em&gt;goodly&lt;/em&gt; or  &lt;em&gt;sickly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;measly&lt;/em&gt;), which began with the meaning "unwell" and was generalized at some point to mean "guilty, regretful, or sorry", although only in the phrase "feel badly". The phrase "feel badly", with either of those meanings of&lt;em&gt; badly&lt;/em&gt;, still involves a predicative adjective; but it may encourage those who have been made to feel uneasy about predicative adjectives to yield to their impulse towards hypercorrections like "feel terribly".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if enough people engage often enough in a particular hypercorrection, it may become part of the norms of the language. In this particular case, there are at least three ways that could happen, in order of decreasing generality:  (1) &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; could change so as to allow following adverbs as a general way to express properties of its subject; (2) &lt;em&gt;terribly&lt;/em&gt; could take on a second life as an adjective; (3) the expression &amp;quot;feel terribly&amp;quot; could become an idiom, as a sort of intensive form of &amp;quot;feel badly&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s quite clear, I think, that (1) has not happened. The evidence is also pretty strongly against (2) — &amp;quot;*he seems terribly&amp;quot; is just as bad as &amp;quot;*he seems badly&amp;quot;, I think. But I&amp;#39;m not sure about the status of (3) — as an alternative (or supplement) to hypercorrection, it&amp;#39;s plausible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240489959909"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_661.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/58a3100c4df032db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-04-23T13:25:10Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T13:25:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/M5jVj9xv79o/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_661.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_661.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_661.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_661.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/M5jVj9xv79o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240484041945"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3490">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0c2e5a1ea40f9ffd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Malaria"/><category term="mosquitoes"/><category term="bed nets"/><category term="music"/><category term="rap"/><title type="html">Nothing but Nets</title><published>2009-04-23T10:52:44Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T10:52:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/nothing-but-nets/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now…back to &lt;a href="http://www.rbm.who.int/worldmalariaday/"&gt;World Malaria Day&lt;/a&gt; [Week] here at the Bug Blog.  This has to be one of the most charming rap songs ever–a &lt;a title="Ron Clark Academy" href="http://www.ronclarkacademy.com/about.aspx"&gt;group of Atlanta kids&lt;/a&gt; do a rap song for &lt;a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net/"&gt;Nothing but Nets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday, April 23, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unregistered health provider ordered to stop misleading cancer patients &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Mackay woman who made misleading and deceptive claims about a mineral supplement has been ordered by the Brisbane Supreme Court to discontinue providing intravenous treatment to cancer patients. Minister for Fair Trading Peter Lawlor said unregistered health provider Jillian Margaret Newlands was caught administering a concoction made from a mixture of citric acid and sodium chlorite to cancer sufferers and claiming the product cured cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Office of Fair Trading was alerted to Ms Newland’s activities following a Health Quality Complaints Commission investigation. The Office of Fair Trading sought an injunction under the Fair Trading Act 1989 to prevent her from misleading and deceiving consumers,” Mr Lawlor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ms Newlands has no formal qualifications as a nurse or naturopath,” Mr Lawlor said. “Ms Newlands went so far as to inject her ‘patients’ with a ‘miracle mineral supplement’ while dishonestly promoting its benefits with no scientific basis for her claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court order obtained by the Office of Fair Trading banned Ms Newlands from administering any substance intravenously and supplying any goods, services or any other substance which has not been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ms Newlands was ordered to pay court costs of more than $12,000 and has also been restrained from making any claims she is able to treat, cure, or benefit any person suffering from cancer” he said. “She charged cancer sufferers up to $2000 for treatment services she administered in her home garage and went so far as to advise one cancer patient not to pursue chemotherapy treatment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was no evidence of any sterile handling techniques or any proper storage of medical utensils and equipment used by Ms Newlands at her home. “This sort of deceptive conduct is completely unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If consumers have concerns in regards to their dealings with Jillian Newlands, they should visit their nearest healthcare professional immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story begins with an investigation by A Current Affair earlier this year, with the help of our very own Loretta Marron, where she went undercover with a hidden camera. You can watch the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8S1sp2YvQ"&gt;Loretta Marron busts a cancer quack on A Current Affair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/23/2550810.htm?section=justin"&gt;News articles&lt;/a&gt; of the story today cite evidence from a cancer patient who was told not to seek chemotherapy treatment. This cancer patient is our very own Loretta. In fact, it was her who contacted the QLD Health Complaints Commission and told them to get in touch with A Current Affair for the footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of my &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/regulating-the-unregistered/"&gt;Zone blog&lt;/a&gt; would also be aware that it is illegal in NSW to claim to cure incurable illnesses including cancer, in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Unregistered Practitioners. Perhaps QLD will one day get a similar code, but in the meantime I applaud the hard work and tenacity of Loretta Marron and congratulate her on her continued efforts to protect the vulnerable and sick from opportunistic quacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing about a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fresh_from_huffpo_antibiotics_cause_canc.php"&gt;new low of pseudoscience published in that repository of all things antivaccine and quackery, The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; (do you even have to ask?), on Tuesday, I had hoped--really hoped--that I could ignore HuffPo for a while. After all, there's only so much stupid that even Orac can tolerate before his logic circuits start shorting out and he has to shut down a while so that his self-repair circuits can undo the damage. Besides, I sometimes think that the twit who created HuffPo, Arianna Huffington, &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; the attention that pseudoscience turds dropped onto her blog by quackery boosters of the like of Kim Evans garner. Certainly, the HuffPo editors seem utterly untroubled that, among physicians and medical scientists, HuffPo is viewed with utter contempt and ridicule. Certainly, I view Arianna's vanity project that way whenever it publishes the antivaccine stylings of ignoramuses like Deirdre Imus or cranks like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and David Kirby, especially now that HuffPo's decided that antivaccine nonsense isn't enough and that it needs to "kick the pseudoscience up a notch" with its latest quack recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, HuffPo has decided that even Kim Evans is not enough to bury its reputation when it comes to any form of medical science so deep into the mud that it would require nuclear weapons to blast it out; that is, if you even accept the contention that HuffPo even has a reputation for medical science. What am I talking about? I'm sure many of you know; you've deluged me with copies of links to this article. No, no, don't worry, I'm not annoyed.

&lt;p&gt;Now I used to be philosophically against Hate Crime laws because I thought they were essentially thought crime. I now recognize that this is not the case. Hate Crime laws do not criminalize undesirable thoughts but rather only play a role in cases where violent crimes have been committed, &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/04/hate-crime-lies.html"&gt;contrary to what the religious would have us believe:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bulletin sent to pastors, the Family Research Council claim that if the bill becomes law, religious leaders will be subject to prosecution for preaching against homosexuality. But the fact is that H.R. 1913, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 would do no such thing. The bill calls for granting the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute people for violent crimes based on race, color, religion, nationality, disability, gender, or sexual orientation if local officials refuse to prosecute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already obviously judge violent crime differently based on intent (ex. first degree murder, manslaughter, etc.) and we already have some Hate Crime legislation the judges people differently based on motive. The only meaningful difference with the new laws seems to be that it includes hate against sexual orientation along with racial, gender, etc. This isnt’ criminalizing thought but merely another deterent to prevent violent crime against those individuals stastistically most likely to be the victims of violent crime. That seems like the height of rationality in a humane society looking for reasonable solutions to violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it absolutely does not prevent religious individuals from preaching the hate they love so much. I mean can you imagine what religion would look like without their self-righteous hate? What would they do with all that spare time?&lt;/p&gt;

But this time it’s not David Kirby or Dan Olmstead. No, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html"&gt;this time it’s by comedian and movie actor Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was amazed to hear a commentary by CNN’s Campbell Brown on the controversial vaccine issue. After a ruling by the ’special vaccine court’ saying the Measles, Mumps, Rubella shot wasn’t found to be responsible for the plaintiffs’ autism, she and others in the media began making assertions that the judgment was in, and vaccines had been proven safe. No one would be more relieved than Jenny and I if that were true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:I37zRf55BS4qbM:http://www.doubletake-media.com/movie_of_the_weak_dumb_comp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:I37zRf55BS4qbM:http://www.doubletake-media.com/movie_of_the_weak_dumb_comp.jpg" alt="" width="101" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First of all, there is no controversy, only the manufactured one presented in the popular media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, all 3 test cases Carrey alludes to concerned MMR vaccines, thimerosal-containing vaccines, and the combination. The hearings also gave information on whether MMR or thimerosal separately caused autism. And these were the 3 cases chosen by the lawyers representing the parents for the very reason that they represented the strongest cases they had against the vaccines. And they still lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vsd/vsd_publications.htm"&gt;the vaccines HAVE been proven safe&lt;/a&gt;, so according to you, you and Jenny should be ecstatic. But your not. And that’s because Jenny is a D-list actor whose fame, fortune, and self-worth almost entirely relies now on her role as advocate for autistic children who have been “injured” by vaccines. She also loses her scapegoat and is left with no one to blame for the senseless tragedy of having a child who struggles to connect to the rest of the world. You take that away from Jenny and what has she got left? What’s her legacy? A DVD copy of “Witless Protection?” And you, Jim, would lose the activist girlfriend you love and have to accept that you’re just dating a crazy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with all due respect to Ms. Brown, a ruling against causation in three cases out of more than 5000 hardly proves that other children won’t be adversely affected by the MMR, let alone that all vaccines are safe. This is a huge leap of logic by anyone’s standards. Not everyone gets cancer from smoking, but cigarettes do cause cancer. After 100 years and many rulings in favor of the tobacco companies, we finally figured that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we have this straw man. Of course Ms. Brown’s position isn’t solely based on 3 small court cases, but additionally &lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Vaccines"&gt;numerous clinically controlled studies each analyzing the data of thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; as well as the overwhelming number of expert opinions. The data is so strongly against the vaccine-autism hypothesis and so much in favor of genetic causes that you could say it fits “like a glove!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the number of reputable studies that supports Carrey’s view (Total number = zero).  How about this, Jim. When you can present numerous reputable studies that support your position, by all means present the results to the scientific community. Sound good? Allllrighty then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actually, applying Carrey’s own analogy, his position more closely resembles those who would claim that not enough evidence supports a link between tobacco and cancer as the same quality scientific research that support such a link between tobacco and cancer suggest no link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that no one without a vested interest in the profitability of vaccines has studied all 36 of them in depth. There are more than 100 vaccines in development, and &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; tests for cumulative effect or vaccine interaction of all 36 vaccines in the current schedule have ever been done. If I’m mistaken, I challenge those who are making such grand pronouncements about vaccine safety to produce those studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:OuiuwXPH1EAyrM:http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00063/pg-8-Carey-PA_63970t.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:OuiuwXPH1EAyrM:http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00063/pg-8-Carey-PA_63970t.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="117"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Actually Jim, every vaccine as well as ever drug is required to go through years of clinical testing before being put on the market, so literally hundreds of long-term and short-term studies have been conducted on each vaccine. Further, scientists have compared the rate of autism between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in multiple countries and found no meaningful difference. Further, as I pointed out in a blog post yesterday, the U.S. vaccine schedule includes 13 more vaccines than the UK does by the age of 2, and yet the UK has a larger autism population. But of course your position doesn’t appear so doomed if we just throw out all the facts and wipe our memories. Oh, the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are to believe that the ruling of the ‘vaccine court’ in these cases mean that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; vaccines are safe, then we must also consider the rulings of that same court in the Hannah Polling and Bailey Banks cases, which ruled vaccines &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the cause of autism and therefore assume that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; vaccines are &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;safe. Clearly both are irresponsible assumptions, and neither option is prudent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:EebTKMxyXR1SoM:http://i32.tinypic.com/29nuph4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:EebTKMxyXR1SoM:http://i32.tinypic.com/29nuph4.jpg" alt="" width="91" height="129"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I guess this isn’t one of those days where Jim is incapable of lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The Hannah Poling case was not tried in the same special courts as the first 3 Autism Omnibus cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=341"&gt; The Hannah Poling case &lt;/a&gt;wasn’t won but rather ended in a settlement and was specifically not included as a test case in the Autism Omnibus cases because of her pre-existing condition, a mitochondrial disorder that made her a unique case. And the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;Bailey Banks case&lt;/a&gt; also didn’t rule that vaccines cause autism but because of the complexity of the science, it’s easy for propagandists to fool people into thinking that was the finding so I recommend reading the link above for more detail about that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this growing crisis, we cannot afford to blindly trumpet the agenda of the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or vaccine makers. Now more than ever, we must resist the urge to close this book before it’s been written. The anecdotal evidence of millions of parents who’ve seen their totally normal kids regress into sickness and mental isolation after a trip to the pediatrician’s office must be seriously considered. The legitimate concern they and many in the scientific community have that environmental toxins, including those found in vaccines, may be causing autism and other disorders (Aspergers, ADD, ADHD), cannot be dissuaded by a show of sympathy and a friendly invitation to look for the ‘real’ cause of autism anywhere but within the lucrative vaccine program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, now we get at the meat of Carrey’s argument. Don’t listen to the experts and their evil science. Listen to me, an actor with no medical knowledge whatsoever because I have anecdotal evidence. This isn’t merely about blindly following the CDC or the AAP (incidentally 2 of the most reputable medical institutions in the world). First of all, virtually every medical expert in the world agrees with them on this issue. But more importantly, the evidence is so overwhelmingly supporting them. And the scientific method is specifically designed to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php#more"&gt;weed out fraud over time, as in the case of Jim and Jenny’s hero Mr. Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. But this whole dishonest and inconsistent elitism gambit of first criticizing the experts that disagree with them and then trumpeting their cherry-picked “experts” is quite common among anti-vaccinationists, as is evidenced &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523#more-523"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further anecdotal evidence alone is among the weakest forms of evidence possible, and no matter how high you build a pile of shit, it will never turn into gold. Indeed, if anecdotal evidence alone was worth anything, we’d all have to accept that millions of people have been adbucted by aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vaccines being the fastest growing division of the pharmaceutical industry, isn’t it possible that profits may play a part in the decision-making? That the vaccine program is becoming more of a profit engine than a means of prevention? In a world left reeling from the catastrophic effects of greed, mismanagement and corporate insensitivity, is it so absurd for us to wonder why American children are being given twice as many vaccines on average, compared to the top 30 first world countries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, now it’s all about building a conspiracy. If drug companies wanted to make money off of autism and had the power to put unproven drugs out on the market, don’t you think they would have put out some kind of drug product that allegedly treats autism that might actually make them money as opposed to just continuing to sell many unprofitable vaccines. And yes, most vaccines are not very profitable at all. And what is Jim getting at here anyway? Is he suggesting that vaccines are a sham medical product? And since vaccines have proven to save millions of lives every year and haven’t proven to seriously harm many people at all, how can any sane person suggest the risk is greater than the reward? If Jim’s going to flat-out say that medical professionals are letting children be poisoned for their own monitary benefit he’s going to have to back that up with facts. So far, he’s presented none, only paranoid suspicions. And we receive more vaccines because they’re effective in preventing disease. It’s unfortunate that most countries don’t have as strong a vaccine program as we do. Maybe that’s why the mortality rate in most countries is greater than in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Offit, the vaccine advocate and profiteer, who helped invent a Rotavirus vaccine is said to have paved the way for his own multi-million dollar windfall while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children’s schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, Offit’s a “profiteer” because he’s such an expert in his field that he invented a life-saving vaccine that helps millions of people. How dare anyone ever profit off of saving lives. I guess firefighters are profiteers too as are police officers and surgeons. This is nothing but shamelss ad hominem. You know what, Jim? Someone has profited off of every medicine you’ve ever purchased. That’s how capitalism works! Maybe you shouldn’t buy groceries either because your grocer is a “profiteer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I think I’m done with this nonsense. Jim makes a fine actor and comedian, and a lousy thinker.&lt;/p&gt;

[&lt;em&gt;This post is a draft of a letter I am writing to the director of our town's YMCA.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Kristina Chew and my son, Charlie Fisher, is almost 12 years old and on the autism spectrum. Charlie is an athletic boy who loves to be active and in motion. Charlie loves to ride his bike on 10 mile rides through local towns with his dad, Jim Fisher, and to swim in the ocean at the Jersey Shore. Charlie's language is minimal and he has numerous cognitive and other challenges and requires one-on-one care; he must always be accompanied by an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We frequently take Charlie to the different YMCA facilities to use the swimming pools and the equipment in the fitness rooms. As one YMCA facility has family changing rooms, it is not a problem for me to take Charlie to shower and change his clothes; however, as the swim team and other groups often use the pools at this YMCA facility, swim time is often limited for Charlie. The pool at another YMCA facility is often more available for Charlie to swim in, but the locker rooms at this facility are either for men or for women, and there are no family changing rooms. When I have taken Charlie to this latter YMCA, the front desk has made it clear that he is not allowed in the women's locker room to change out of his swimsuit after swimming, and Charlie and I have been directed to use a restroom for individuals with disabilities that is three flights of stairs up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the YMCA's regulations concerning children above a certain age not being allowed into the locker room for the opposite sex. When we swim at the YMCA facility with the family locker rooms, it is not a problem for Charlie to change out of his wet swimsuit. When we swim at the other facility, I have sometimes simply taken Charlie home in his wet clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in March, Charlie and I went to the YMCA without the family locker rooms. My son was having a difficult day and he and I were glad to be at the pool, as swimming often has a calming effect on him. Due to circumstances, Charlie got very upset in my car and was still somewhat upset when he and I entered the YMCA facility, and I sensed that it would be difficult for him to go up the three flights of stairs to the restroom to change into his swimsuit. I therefore asked the staff at the front desk if it might be possible for Charlie to very briefly enter the women's locker room to change into his suit, after which he and I would exit. We were informed that this was simply not possible. Due to my concerns about my son's being upset, I asked a number of times if we might. After some exchanges, the front desk had a female staff member accompany Charlie and me into the women's locker room. He quickly changed into his swimsuit and he and I then exited and, rather than walking through the rest of the locker room, used a different door to enter the pool, where one person was swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand and respect the YMCA's regulations. We request, though, that the YMCA take into account the need for accommodations for individuals on the autism spectrum and with disabilities. Indeed, the YMCA facility where my son is required to change in a third-floor restroom is actually housed in a building that includes a school and center for autistic children. The YMCA is of course a separate organization from the autism school, but the proximity of the autism school provides an excellent opportunity for the YMCA staff to learn about accommodations for autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it would seem that this situation would provide the YMCA with an excellent opportunity for enabling the YMCA to fulfill its mission of "helping all people grow in spirit, mind and body" and for setting its "core principles of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility" into action. The YMCA's vision is "serving many needs, creating one community"; at this time, I would say that our YMCA is not achieving this vision as it is not serving the needs of all members of its community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are indeed grateful for the special programs that the YMCA has created for children on the autism spectrum. However, some of these programs are aimed primarily at younger children. As my own son has gotten older, we are most interested in using the facilities of the YMCA to teach him a daily fitness routine and to integrate use of the pool, exercise room, etc. into my son's daily life. As the parent of an older child on the autism spectrum, I request that the YMCA consider more and novel ways to include children on the autism spectrum in its regular activities, rather than placing them in "special" programs. Again, many of these "special" programs are of great value, but they do not always bring children on the spectrum into the YMCA community in ways that benefit children with disabilities and the community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask, therefore, that the YMCA consider more and new ways to make accommodations for individuals on the autism spectrum, and therefore to find ways to integrate individuals as fully as possible into the life of its community. Only by doing this will the YMCA truly fulfill its mission and attain its core principles and, indeed, be an institution that is "serving many needs, creating one community."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240469562251"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2204">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ba12a09b5f1249c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Fallout of the vaccine-autism scare: Measles in the US</title><published>2009-04-23T05:35:21Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T05:35:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/LPFW50qc674/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240468937327"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-2487790559627942649">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/34ef02f0878ea74e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Danish, anybody?</title><published>2009-04-23T02:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T02:07:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/ykQtF32elE0/danish-anybody.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=2487790559627942649" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/danish-anybody.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Sadly, I can't read Danish and therefore I am not sure quite what this article in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ingeniøren&lt;/span&gt; actually says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://ing.dk/artikel/97896-evolutionsteorien-er-under-stadig-udvikling"&gt;Evolutionsteorien er under stadig udvikling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I can say that the author, Robin Engelhardt, was not only pleasant but he absolutely had done his homework and grasped the issue (whether the rise of epigenetics constitutes neo-Lamarckism) quite well.

Kingsley's booklet, &lt;a href="http://easteranswer.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Easter Answer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and my conclusion is that it not only contains a great deal of ignorance about how the gospels were written in the first place (see Luke 1:1-4; he even quotes from the discredited longer ending of Mark), but also that the scenario he presents is quite flawed in several places. It's no answer at all to harmonizing the Gospel accounts of the resurrection stories of Jesus.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kingsley is attempting to answer Dan Barker’s &lt;a href="http://easteranswer.com/Easter-Challenge.html"&gt;Easter Challenge&lt;/a&gt; offered in his book, &lt;em&gt;Losing Faith in Faith&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a challenge that a skeptic named Ralph Nielsen offered $1,000 if anyone could meet it. Basically the challenge asks the believer to “go to your Bible and put together the various resurrection stories into one consistent narrative. Read Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24 and John 20 &amp;amp; 21. Read also Acts 1:3-12 and 1 Corinthians 15:3-8. List all the events from the resurrection to the ascension of Jesus without omitting any detail. If you can do this with no contradictions I will pay you a $1000 reward.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kingsley’s answer fails miserably, I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take for example Matthew 28:1-7:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 4The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5 The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kingsley disagrees with the majority of  today's translators on verse 1 and instead goes with the 1971 New American Standard Bible where it begins "Now late on the Sabbath..." So Kingsley claims verse 1 describes events that took place, not after the Sabbath day was over, but instead late on the Sabbath day, at say, 5:45 PM. Then Kingsley claims verses 2-4, the angel's rolling away of the stone, took place several hours later between 12 midnight and 3:00 AM. And finally he claims verses 5-7 describes the events that took place at 6:30 AM when women first discover the tomb was empty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problems are inherent just in these short verses, for when reading Matthew they are meant to describe a flow to the events he narrates. These events in Matthew's Gospel are supposed to be taken in order right after each other. It requires Kingsley to rewrite the Gospel to produce one of his own, which as it stands disagrees with all four of them individually. As Bart Ehrman argues, what happened that morning depends on which Gospel we read! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kingsley has Mary Magdalene visiting the tomb four times, telling the disciples on three separate occasions about it, and having Peter run to discover the empty tomb not once, but twice. On Mary’s third visit to the empty tomb she encounters Jesus himself and touches him (John 20:10-17). But on her fourth visit to the empty tomb (Mark 16:1-3; Luke 24:1-2) Mary Magdalene goes with other women to anoint the dead body of Jesus and unbelievably keeps silent that she already knew Jesus had arisen and the tomb was empty! Kingsley suggests Mary kept silent presumably because Peter and the other disciples told her to (without any Biblical support), or that Jesus ONLY told her to tell the “brethren” and did not require her to tell women, or because the other women might have been jealous and accused her of a delusion, even though she was emphatically NOT afraid of telling men who would’ve been more skeptical of her testimony as a woman!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kingsley also tries to harmonize the five appearances of Jesus to his disciples in the four Gospels with Paul's completely different chronological list of six appearances in I Corinthians 15. To do this Kingsley merely combines them together to make eleven appearances, ignoring the fact that Paul intends to provide not just a list of appearances but a chronology of appearances. And Paul's chronology does not accord with Kingsley's chronology either, when we consider that Paul never mentions any appearances to women at all (Kingsley claims Paul didn't recount them because of their social status, but then why did the Gospel writers do so?). Furthermore, the four Gospels never make mention of the 500 hundred people whom Paul boasted in I Corinthians as having seen the resurrected Jesus at one time, even though this fact would’ve been an astounding confirmation of the Gospel writer's claims. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think Kingsley should take heed of what several Christian scholars said about attempting such a project, as quoted by him on page 20: Dr. Daniel Wallace of Dallas Theological Seminary said: “No plausible solution has presented itself.” Dr. J. Lyle Story, of Regent University said, “I do know that it’s next to impossible to provide the sequence of events in the post-Resurrections…there’s no way that they can all be harmonized.” Dr. Donald Hagner of Fuller Theological Seminary said the problem is a “notorious” one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kingsley has emphatically not harmonized the accounts by far. His attempted harmonization is far fetched and as such no answer at all. He does not deserve the $1,000 dollars from Ralph Nielsen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will say though, that it was very interesting for me to see the extent a believer will go to prove his faith true. I think it's high time such an attempt is abandoned entirely. It's time that evangelical believers look at the &lt;em&gt;phenomena&lt;/em&gt; of the Bible and then only &lt;em&gt;afterward&lt;/em&gt; construct a theory about inspiration, rather than continuing to allow their preconceived inerrant theory about the Bible to force the phenomena of the Bible into a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes"&gt;Procrustean Bed&lt;/a&gt;. Let the Bible do it's own talking. Stop forcing it to fit your preconceived inerrant theory due to ignorant assumptions picked up in Sunday School when you were kids. Grow up. Learn. Question. That's what adults do in most every other area, except unfortunately, when it comes to religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6712638544010723721?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In &lt;i&gt;Rowan&lt;/i&gt;, Justice Burger laments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the plethora of mass mailings subsidized by low postal rates, and the growth of the sale of large mailing lists as an industry, in itself, have changed the mailman from a carrier of primarily private communications, as he was in a more leisurely day, and have made him an adjunct of the mass mailer who sends unsolicited and often unwanted mail into every home. It places no strain on the doctrine of judicial notice to observe that, whether measured by pieces or pounds, Everyman's mail today is made up overwhelmingly of material he did not seek from persons he does not know. And, all too often, it is matter he finds offensive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things have only gotten worse since 1970.  Here are the most recent statistics from the Postal Service on junk mail (here, roughly defined as "standard mail").  Starting in 2005, the Postal Service started carrying more standard mail than first class, and now the gulf between the two is pretty significant.  Also, note that the standard mail is much heavier than first class mail, and it generates LESS revenue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Francisco recently &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS13650+01-Apr-2009+PRN20090401"&gt;passed a resolution&lt;/a&gt; calling for a do-not-junk-mail list.

One day they’ll tell you that they espouse only evidence-based practices and the next they’ll be promoting snake oil. This double talk is hard to combat, since to disprove them one would essentially have to provide a video of their contradictory remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I participated in a series of business meetings with a CAM practitioner in attendance (he was an MD who graduated from UCSF). During one meeting he boldly proclaimed his support of scientifically rigorous research, and praised the Cochrane Collaborative’s efforts to provide systematic reviews of the evidence (or lack thereof) for various practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours later we were sitting together in another meeting in which I objected to the publication of a consumer article that would assist parents of children with autism in finding a DAN! practitioner who could provide &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelation.html"&gt;chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; to their children. I explained that there was no evidence for the efficacy of such treatments, and plenty of evidence for their harm (including the death of at least one child that &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CAE25.htm"&gt;I’d read about&lt;/a&gt; in the news). I suggested that an article describing these dangers might be in order, but that an article encouraging chelation use for autism was simply unethical and I would not allow it to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of agreeing with me, the CAM MD suggested that I was being “narrow” and that I should allow consumers to “explore all their options.” I was stunned. This was the same person who had just said that he fully supported scientific inquiry. So I asked him how he could say that he supported evidence-based medicine, and then turn around and ignore evidence at will – even at the peril of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response dumbfounded me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am just as comfortable practicing within an evidence-based framework as I am outside it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which sounded a lot to me like, “I’m just as comfortable lying as I am telling the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more flabbergasting was the perception of the others in our meetings. Having no medical training or science background, they perceived our disagreements as “two nice doctors who don’t get along.” Of course, Dr. CAM fanned this perception and encouraged them to see me as “paternalistic” while he was “open-minded.” All the while I was trying to protect parents from harming their children based on information that might seem credible in the context of a reputable online health site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the old adage “perception is nine tenths of reality” was no clearer to me than during this day of meetings. In the face of what most healthcare professionals would see as an outright violation of Dr. CAM’s Hippocratic oath, to the untrained eye this was a mere disagreement between doctors. One seemed pretty upset and intense (me) and the other seemed cool and breezy (CAM). Which is the more appealing demeanor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a hospitalized patient’s life is in danger, I’d like to think that their doctor would be intensely interested in intervening. A shruggie attitude in that context would rightly be perceived as uncaring and irresponsible. However, change the setting from hospital to decision-support tool, and suddenly the acuity is lost on the audience. Unfortunately, the acuity remains – as patients use the Internet as a resource for “informed decision-making” all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what it will take to impress upon healthcare professionals and patients alike the importance of reliable information online. The problem is that the damage is harder to quantify and rarely reported. Who will measure the effects of bad information on health? Who can know which false advice is used versus ignored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent Pew Foundation &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=O5cPv4jRGPMC&amp;amp;pg=PA5&amp;amp;lpg=PA5&amp;amp;dq=example+of+person+being+harmed+by+false+health+information+online&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=TKaoKrI2tA&amp;amp;sig=PwfchP5tQc1UkbiW4nMZCgMwFtE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=BHvvSeboJaaxtgfcktnIDw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4#PPA5,M1"&gt;study suggests&lt;/a&gt; that 70% of those who seek health information online say that it influences how they treat a condition. About 18% say they use the information to diagnose or treat a condition without a doctor’s consultation. An &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/scientificstudies.html"&gt;interesting website&lt;/a&gt; (created by a concerned patient named Tim Farley) actually aggregates a large number of journal article reports, news stories, and personal anecdotes related to harm experienced by patients who were either misinformed or chose alternative medicine therapies to their detriment.  The stories are both tragic and eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing patient choices back to the online site or page that gave them the idea in the first place may be hard to do. But I think that healthcare professionals owe it to patients to protect them from obviously harmful advice when it is in their power to do so. I don’t agree with Dr. CAM that such an approach is paternalistic.  I think it’s part of being a caring professional and a good physician.&lt;/p&gt;

Judge Perez Hilton asked Miss California &lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Carrie Prejean a question about her views on same-sex marriage, and she responded that she believes it’s wrong because that’s what her religion says. And it’s pretty much definitive at this point that it was her answer to this 1 question that cost her the crown because she was ahead until she offended Judge Perez Hilton with her answer causing Hilton to take away points. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Now the rational people recognize that this was a legitimate question and that the judge had every right to take away points because they were offended by her answer. But then there’s the irrational aka the bigots who only see this as “the homosexual agenda” encroaching on our lives and the further persecution of Christianity:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/another-stupid-beauty-pageant-controversy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ElW6GLW15qM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Ironically though, this is just an example of the privileged religious being pissed that their typical manipulative methods of crying persecution every time things don’t go their way didn’t work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;This is evidenced in Bill O’Reilly’s usual feeble attempt at rational discourse:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/another-stupid-beauty-pageant-controversy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/LIQMSXUSiqY/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here O’Reilly deliberately tries to straw man Wayne Besen’s position by trying to frame Besen and Perez Hilton as being the bigot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t be friends with anybody? You can’t respect anybody who doesn’t believe in gay marriage?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is clearly not the issue here at all. People are free to have personal prejudices. No one is arguing otherwise. But Miss &lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Prejean is in a competition for the title of Miss Teen USA, which not only puts her in the public eye but also arguably makes her a kind of role model for other kids. So like with any other public figure, her public views are subject to scrutiny. Bill knows this. He’s no dummy. I call this tactic a deliberate set-up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;And I’m a little disappointed in Wayne Besen for not analogizing it to a hypothetical contestant who claimed they had strong religious beliefs against interracial marriage, something that was quite common in our recent past but is more overtly unacceptable in our current age. No sane public figure would admit holding such a view because of what Sam Harris has called, “a conversational intolerance.” Harris frequently uses as his example someone who publicly admits their strong belief that Elvis is still alive. Harris points out that anyone would be entirely justified to choose not to hire a person for a job based solely on the fact that this person holds such a strong but obviously delusional belief. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Then O’Reilly blurts out this total BS line:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’m against gay marriage because I don’t believe it reflects what the country’s vision is of a stable society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;What? I don’t even think O’Reilly himself knows what the hell that gibberish means. It’s as incoherent as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WALIARHHLII"&gt;Miss South Carolina’s infamous blunder&lt;/a&gt;. The country doesn’t have a vision, Bill. It’s an abstract noun, and abstract nouns don’t have opinions. At least that’s what lunch tells me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Notice how O’Reilly’s response to a logical argument is to just shout “That’s your opinion!” as if that’s actually an argument. Yes Bill, that’s his opinion. He has an opinion and you have an opinion. That’s how this works. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;But this is a case where 1 opinion is clearly far more correct than the other. Gay bigots will certainly disagree with me as to who has the correct opinion but all the objectively reasonable and logical arguments fall on 1 side and it isn’t their side. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Perez Hilton may very well have  intentionally exploited this pageant by seizing this opportunity to draw attention to the issue. I don’t know. But it’s irrelevant. As a judge he had every right to judge based on whatever criteria he pleased, and if her answer actually offended his moral sensabilities as it did mine, then his case is looking pretty strong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Bill would have us believe that it’s perfectly acceptable to dismiss a beauty pageant contestant for being fat or having stupid hair but to dismiss her based on her political views is bigotry, which is absurd. Beauty pageants have ALWAYS had question and answer competitions. And when have they ever not judged contestants on their answers? Never. That’s when. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s not what we do in America. We don’t punish people for their freedom of opinion!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Bill, America judged Tom Cruise for jumping on a fuckin’ coach! Who are you kidding?!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get fired for doing it [saying my opinion]“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;A. She wasn’t fired. A judge fairly voted her down for offending him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;B. People absolutely do get fired from jobs for spouting out offensive opinions. See Don Imus. And Howard Stern would have been fired tons of times if he didn’t make so much money for the station he worked for.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN"&gt;Bill doesn’t have a case and he knows he doesn’t have a case. And is there really anyone out there who doesn’t think that Bill-O would be taking the exact opposite position had the situation been reversed and a judged cost a contestant the crown based on her pro-same-sex marriage beliefs? Anyone?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Board of Education Chairman Don McLeroy, R-Bryan, faced searing questioning during his uncommonly long confirmation hearing Wednesday at the Senate Nominations Committee.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And Chairman Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, said McLeroy's nomination is on shaky ground because he might not be able to get the required two-thirds vote from the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texans, call your congresscritters and urge them to purge this embarrassment from the board of education.

There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=4&amp;amp;day=23&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;24 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.  As always, you should &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/357" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/254" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/261" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005307" title=""&gt;When One Hemisphere Takes Control: Metacontrol in Pigeons (Columba livia)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vertebrate brains are composed of two hemispheres that receive input, compute, and interact to form a unified response. How the partially different processes of both hemispheres are integrated to create a single output is largely unknown. In some cases one hemisphere takes charge of the response selection - a process known as metacontrol. Thus far, this phenomenon has only been shown in a handful of studies with primates, mostly conducted in humans. Metacontrol, however, is even more relevant for animals like birds with laterally placed eyes and complete chiasmatic decussation since visual input to the hemispheres is largely different. Homing pigeons (Columba livia) were trained with a color discrimination task. Each hemisphere was trained with a different color pair and therefore had a different experience. Subsequently, the pigeons were binocularly examined with two additional stimuli that combined the positive color of one hemisphere with a negative color that had been shown to the other, omitting the availability of a coherent solution and confronting the pigeons with a conflicting situation. Some of the pigeons responded to both stimuli, indicating that none of the hemispheres dominated the overall preference. Some birds, however, responded primarily to one of the conflicting stimuli, showing that they based their choice on the left- or right-monocularly learned color pair, indicating hemispheric metacontrol. We could demonstrate for the first time that metacontrol is a widespread phenomenon that also exists in birds, and thus in principle requires no corpus callosum. Our results are closely similar to those in humans: monocular performance was higher than binocular one and animals displayed different modes of hemispheric dominance. Thus, metacontrol is a dynamic and widely distributed process that possibly constitutes a requirement for all animals with a bipartite brain to confront the problem of choosing between two hemisphere-bound behavioral options.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005252" title=""&gt;DNA-Based Diet Analysis for Any Predator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prey DNA from diet samples can be used as a dietary marker; yet current methods for prey detection require a priori diet knowledge and/or are designed ad hoc, limiting their scope. I present a general approach to detect diverse prey in the feces or gut contents of predators. In the example outlined, I take advantage of the restriction site for the endonuclease Pac I which is present in 16S mtDNA of most Odontoceti mammals, but absent from most other relevant non-mammalian chordates and invertebrates. Thus in DNA extracted from feces of these mammalian predators Pac I will cleave and exclude predator DNA from a small region targeted by novel universal primers, while most prey DNA remain intact allowing prey selective PCR. The method was optimized using scat samples from captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) fed a diet of 6-10 prey species from three phlya. Up to five prey from two phyla were detected in a single scat and all but one minor prey item (2% of the overall diet) were detected across all samples. The same method was applied to scat samples from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins; up to seven prey taxa were detected in a single scat and 13 prey taxa from eight teleost families were identified in total. Data and further examples are provided to facilitate rapid transfer of this approach to any predator. This methodology should prove useful to zoologists using DNA-based diet techniques in a wide variety of study systems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005314" title=""&gt;Screening for Coping Style Increases the Power of Gene Expression Studies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Individuals of many vertebrate species show different stress coping styles and these have a striking influence on how gene expression shifts in response to a variety of challenges. This is clearly illustrated by a study in which common carp displaying behavioural predictors of different coping styles (characterised by a proactive, adrenaline-based or a reactive, cortisol-based response) were subjected to inflammatory challenge and specific gene transcripts measured in individual brains. Proactive and reactive fish differed in baseline gene expression and also showed diametrically opposite responses to the challenge for 80% of the genes investigated. Incorporating coping style as an explanatory variable can account for some the unexplained variation that is common in gene expression studies, can uncover important effects that would otherwise have passed unnoticed and greatly enhances the interpretive value of gene expression data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005299" title=""&gt;Assembling the Marine Metagenome, One Cell at a Time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulty associated with the cultivation of most microorganisms and the complexity of natural microbial assemblages, such as marine plankton or human microbiome, hinder genome reconstruction of representative taxa using cultivation or metagenomic approaches. Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91% and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005313" title=""&gt;Biological Process Linkage Networks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The traditional approach to studying complex biological networks is based on the identification of interactions between internal components of signaling or metabolic pathways. By comparison, little is known about interactions between higher order biological systems, such as biological pathways and processes.We propose a methodology for gleaning patterns of interactions between biological processes by analyzing protein-protein interactions, transcriptional co-expression and genetic interactions. At the heart of the methodology are the concept of Linked Processes and the resultant network of biological processes, the Process Linkage Network (PLN). We construct, catalogue, and analyze different types of PLNs derived from different data sources and different species. When applied to the Gene Ontology, many of the resulting links connect processes that are distant from each other in the hierarchy, even though the connection makes eminent sense biologically. Some others, however, carry an element of surprise and may reflect mechanisms that are unique to the organism under investigation. In this aspect our method complements the link structure between processes inherent in the Gene Ontology, which by its very nature is species-independent. As a practical application of the linkage of processes we demonstrate that it can be effectively used in protein function prediction, having the power to increase both the coverage and the accuracy of predictions, when carefully integrated into prediction methods. Our approach constitutes a promising new direction towards understanding the higher levels of organization of the cell as a system which should help current efforts to re-engineer ontologies and improve our ability to predict which proteins are involved in specific biological processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand this:  I heartily endorse and accept marijuana use for medical purposes; research has clearly shown that it works efficiently in that role, and brings comfort and relief to the suffering.  As a result of this stated conditional acceptance, I have been approached by those who advocate general use of the substance on the same level that tobacco enjoys.  Generally, this makes sense to me, except that if its use were to bring with it the same dreadful health penalties that accompany tobacco, I would be reluctant to accept that.  I am not a drug user, I have never even been inebriated.  That is my personal choice, and I feel that other persons should also enjoy freedom of choice, even if taxes are imposed on that freedom in order to legislate it; I don’t want out-of-control drivers threatening my safety, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs are not for me.  I wish that my friends would not use them.  Case closed…&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240457958952"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/scientifical_journalism_done_g.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae3d57d778208c82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Scientifical journalism done good</title><published>2009-04-23T04:08:51Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T04:08:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/iv2uJn4xxU8/scientifical_journalism_done_g.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/scientifical_journalism_done_g.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over on an MSN site, there is an image of Ötzi the iceman with a &lt;a href="http://environment.uk.msn.com/wildlife/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=11475705&amp;amp;imageindex=1"&gt;very strange caption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It arrives and it is not bad.  You see the chef walking around the room and as he gets close, he stops at your table and asks you how your chicken tastes.  You tell him that it was pretty good but a little overcooked.  He replies that he “feels” when the chicken is perfect and that it has nothing to do with internal temperatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slightly concerned, you ask about the cutting boards in the kitchen and how they are used with respect to raw chicken.  The chef tells you that everyone in the kitchen uses the same cutting boards for everything and they wash them at the end of the night.  “No sense in washing everything a hundred times, right?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you continue to eat at this establishment?  Would you assume that the Health Inspector would soon make a visit?  I would hope so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From May 11th to 22nd, Brandon Raynor’s School of Natural Therapies is offering a &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/worldwide_massage_schools/canada_massage_courses/toronto_massage_courses.html"&gt;five and ten-day course&lt;/a&gt; at Rhythm in Motion dance studio in Toronto taught by Jason Leue.  Raynor’s theory is that they &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/worldwide_massage_schools/canada_massage_courses/toronto_massage_courses.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“don’t believe that reciting Latin names for muscles or knowing the names of every bump on every bone is what it takes to be and outstanding massage therapist.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (all Raynor's quotes are from &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com"&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this statement there is an incredible level of anti-intellectualism and self-righteousness.  Raynor (and, presumably, Leue) is a practitioner of unproven and unscientific techniques that rely heavily on supposedly manipulating “energy”, “chi”, or whatever non-existent phenomenon he espouses.  Raynor is quoted from a video on his site saying, &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/worldwide_massage_schools/canada_massage_courses/toronto_massage_courses.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“…some people get tingling in their bodies, usually the start of the chi starting to move…you can feel a lot of little bumps and things on his head which is all signs of, um, too much chi in the head.”&lt;/i&gt; (third video)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess that’s a technical diagnosis.  I think I saw that on a chart at Sick Kids once….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that Raynor and Leue are deceiving their potential students and the general public.  In Ontario, to be a registered massage therapist, you have to do a 2200 hour course – two years – during which time you learn about the muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the body; the nervous system; the bones &amp;amp; joints and limitations of said; plus internal anatomy, pathophysiology, proper massage techniques, and much more.  We are complementary health professionals – “complementary” in the sense that our modalities are most effective when used with others such as physiotherapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Raynor’s website, he says that taking his course, &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/worldwide_massage_schools/canada_massage_courses/canada_massage_courses.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“…gives you a legal way to practice in Canada without having to do a 3000 hour course, and also allows you to get full malpractice insurance.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  They will need it.  For reasons similar to why a chef does not know only about what foods look and taste good together, but also about safe internal food temperatures and the dangers of cross-contamination, massage therapists know about anatomy, physiology, and pathology so we can effectively treat our clients or refer to an appropriate health care professional if the problem is outside our scope of practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cmto.com/"&gt;College of Massage Therapists of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; is there to protect the public from practitioners who do not meet the provincial standard.  I know in my practice, contrary to Raynor’s assertion that certified massage programs, &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/general_information/about_massage_training/registered_massage_therapists_in_canada_compared_to_raynor_therapists.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“…fill your head with a lot of jargon and anatomical terms that you will never use…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I explain to clients on a daily basis how specific muscles work, how injuries happen, proper stretching and strengthening techniques, and why if their lower back is injured oftentimes they will get pain in their calf or foot.  Here’s a hint: it has nothing to do with “chi flow”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In July of 2007, the College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia (CMTBC) &lt;a href="http://www.cmtbc.bc.ca/artman/uploads/press_release_-_brandon_raynor.pdf"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; that Raynor’s course was not accredited and that potential students and the public should beware.  The CMTO should follow suit if it has not already done so.  Raynor asks why one would, &lt;a href="http://www.brandonraynor.com/general_information/about_massage_training/registered_massage_therapists_in_canada_compared_to_raynor_therapists.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“…waste 3 years of your life and $20,000 just to use a special reserved word when you can become a better practitioner from our shorter intensive course that is only 10% of the price and uses only 1 or 2 percent of your time but makes you a 200% better practitioner?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  I will take a shot at answering that question:  perhaps because when a client shows up to see an actual registered massage therapist and says, &lt;i&gt;“Listen, my shoulder was injured when I fell off a horse and now my pinkie and ring fingers are tingly.  Can you tell me what’s wrong and can you help me to get better?”&lt;/i&gt;, the answer they do &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; want to hear is, &lt;i&gt;“Oh, of course I can help you!  See, what happened is that you disrupted your chi flow and your aura has turned a dark blue color so I have to massage your arm-y type thing to make the baddies go away.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Massage therapy is a field that, sadly, is riddled with pseudo-science and quackery, but the way to fix it is to keep standards high, encourage critical thinking and basic science skills, and make the bar as high as possible for entry.  By lowering or eliminating standards, as Raynor advocates, we will only see unqualified individuals ultimately causing harm to the public either directly or, more likely, indirectly by changing their minds so clients believe that working with nonsense like “chi”, “meridians”, or “energy” will heal what ails them.  It is then that laypersons will avoid actual proven therapies in times of need, causing pain, suffering and in worst case scenarios, death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raynor advocates letting clients decide who gives the best “treatment”.  At first pass, this sounds like the right thing to do, but there is a flaw in the reasoning.  It is the same flaw that we see when a news organization does the “man on the street” interviews and asks people questions about foreign policy and such.  This is a bogus tactic because most people have no idea about the situation and as such, cannot give an informed opinion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are people who come to the physiotherapy clinics I work at and the treatment they receive may not be the most relaxing or most enjoyable, but that is not why they came.  I treat primarily car accident victims, post surgery clients, sports injuries, and age-related musculo-skeletal conditions.  As such, the clients describe their symptoms, I do diagnostic tests, come up with my clinical impression, and treat them as I see fit.  Most people have no idea how their bodies work, and why would they?  It is not important to them.  They depend on experts to help them when something goes wrong the same way that when a foreign policy situation occurs, most people depend on specialists to deal with it in the appropriate manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Brandon Raynor School must not be allowed to continue advertising in Toronto as it has been.  They deal in quackery, nonsense, and wackaloonery, and then try to act like it is their right to pass it off as health care.  The College of Massage Therapists of Ontario and the general public who deserve better must step up and say “no”.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;According to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, the decision to expand into medical care was inspired by the growing popularity of clinics in supermarkets and pharmacies. “Folks are hurting out there, and retail-based clinics are a more economical option in many circumstances,” Schultz explains. ”Starbucks will offer convenience and reasonable prices for the treatment of common medical concerns just like we do for whole bean organic Mexican shade grown medium roast coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Schultz adds that Starbucks won’t be unveiling just another version of the CVS MinuteClinic or Walgreens Take Care Clinic. “There is a growing mistrust of mainstream medical establishments, regardless of whether they are located in a doctor’s office, a hospital, or a Walmart. And this won’t be one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schultz points to a 2008 survey of health care consumers from the Center for Responsible Application of Pseudoscience (CRAP), a Seattle based think tank coincidentally located in the basement of a Starbucks. Advanced statistical analysis of the survey of nearly eleventy thousand adults revealed that almost 80% of responders would prefer that their medical care be provided by practitioners open to drawing from the world of alternative medicine for more natural treatment options. In response to epidemiological data like this, and the mounting evidence in CRAP approved peer-reviewed journals supporting the safety and efficacy of alternative therapies, Starbucks will staff its clinics with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and energy healers instead of the typical nurse practitioner. These operations will be supervised by naturopathic physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122342767/issue?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;Molecular Ecology Resources&lt;/a&gt; has just published a special issue on DNA barcoding.  This is the result of a conference held at the Royal Ontario Museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the following from the introduction by my friends/colleagues Brian Golding, Bob Hanner, and Paul Hebert:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite some popular misconceptions, the goal of DNA barcoding is neither to determine the tree of life nor to carry out phylogenetic studies. The goal of DNA barcoding is also not molecular taxonomy, as it is not intended to replace classical taxonomy. Its purpose is to carry out species identifications so that even non-experts can determine what species might be at hand, and to do so in a rapid and inexpensive manner. This does not mean that barcodes lack phylogenetic information, or that the sequences do not contribute to taxonomic knowledge. Barcodes can provide evidence for cryptic species, and contribute to knowledge of phylogeny and biogeography. Each of these, however, requires corroboration from additional sources of information for robust support of the hypotheses generated by barcoding. For example, no one would attempt to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the Diptera from 600 bp of mitochondrial sequence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Central to the DNA barcoding enterprise is a database of previously identified reference specimens and their corresponding COI sequences. This requires taxonomists to apply their knowledge and to provide identifications of specimens that can then be barcoded. They must provide their intimate knowledge of the species ranges and morphologies to direct sampling strategies that would cover the greatest likely range of genetic variation. It is then these couplets of information that can be used to identify an unknown specimen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here are the papers, all open access thanks to support from NSERC and Genome Canada (before the cuts):&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:2px solid rgb(204,204,204);margin-bottom:1em"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Molecular Ecology Resources&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Volume 9 Issue s1   May 2009&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Special Issue on Barcoding Life&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preface (p iv-vi)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;G.

&lt;p&gt;The Huffpo is a little island of pampered fluff, where celebrities are asked to &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; (it really isn&amp;#39;t, though—they tend to drop these little turds of pseudo-wisdom, and then never hang around to interact with their readers) simply because they are celebrities, and we are expected to pay attention despite their lack of substantive authority.

A Newfoundland teenager was wrongfully jailed by police who "mistook his autistic behaviour for intoxication," today's &lt;a href="http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2009/04/22/9203011.html"&gt;Edmonton Sun&lt;/a&gt; reports. Diane Spurrell, the teenager's mother, said that her 18-year-old son, Dane, who is on the autism spectrum, was returning home from a video store when he was apprehended by police. He was walking beside the road when police told him to get on the sidewalk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spurrell told the CBC that after her son told officers there was no sidewalk in that area, they asked to smell his breath, and he resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurrell says police did not give him a chance to explain himself and denied him an opportunity to phone her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some basic training in autism---such as that provided by &lt;a href="http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/"&gt;Dennis Debbaudt&lt;/a&gt;---might have made a difference in this situation, especially with the police understanding Dane's behaviors. Says Dane in a &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2009/04/21/autistic-jail.html"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spurrell said he explained there was no sidewalk in that area, and soon after, the police asked to smell his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because of the way that I am, they just assumed … I was drunk — [because of] the way that I was walking and speaking," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurrell admits he resisted the police because he felt he hadn't done anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were like, 'Get in the car.' They were grabbing me and tossing me around and shaking me, and eventually, they got me down on the ground," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recently reported incident further suggests how misperceptions of autism can lead to unfortunate (understatement) consequences. In Indiana, Eddie Uyesugi has been convicted of felony charges of battery and criminal confinement during an "exorcism,"  today's &lt;a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/19242481/detail.html"&gt;IndyChannel&lt;/a&gt; reports. Uyesugi said that he was trying to cast out demons from the 14-year-old boy, who is autistic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uyesugi testified during his trial that he genuinely was trying to help the Bloomington boy and punched him in the face and chest to restrain him during the 2007 ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a minister in training at Cherry Hill Christian Center in Bloomington, but its pastors testified that Uyesugi's actions were inappropriate. Testimony showed the boy's grandmother sought the exorcism for the teen, who sustained bruises and two black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uyesugi faces two to eight year prison terms on each count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is autism seen as (1) drunkenness and (2) possession by demons, by law enforcement and emergency responders and by a minister in training----two accounts of serious misunderstandings of what autism and their consequences, and both during Autism Awareness Month. Clearly we've got a long long way to go with real awareness; with real understanding about autism and about individuals on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240442860513"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/book_review_the_urban_homestea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07cffa87aa861f71</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book review"/><title type="html">Book review: The Urban Homestead.</title><published>2009-04-23T00:13:30Z</published><updated>2009-04-23T00:13:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/2-EEt0SMK6A/book_review_the_urban_homestea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/book_review_the_urban_homestea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/upload/2009/04/UrbanHomestead.jpg" width="350" height="547" alt="UrbanHomestead.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honor of Earth Day, here's a brief review of a fascinating book about making your lifestyle more sustainable.  While some friends of the blog jokingly refer to this as "that hipster survivalist book," &lt;i&gt;The Urban Homestead&lt;/i&gt; is not a book about how to be a green poseur.  Rather, it is a book that breaks down various elements of living greener and lays out a variety of strategies -- some easy and some ambitious -- to make it happen&lt;br&gt;

Today's featured impediment to dialogue has less to do with the mechanics of laying out and engaging with a clear argument and more to do with reasons people might be fearful even to voice their positions:&lt;/p&gt;

The only way for autistic Brazilians to become a priority will be by increased awareness and pressure from public opinion, and maybe it could be achieved if one of the main pastimes in the country--the 9 p.m. daily drama episode show at Globo TV--brings a new character with autism. It may be very possible, since the "novelas" typically showcase social issues and very recently they had characters and actors with Down Syndrome talking about inclusion--one of them was young actress Joana Mocarzel, who was such a hit that now you can buy a &lt;a href="http://www.turmadaclarinha.com.br/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with her features. &lt;/p&gt;

And although his star turn as legal scholar was marred by his own factual errors, and &lt;a href="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/firstimpressions/vol107/diekema.htm"&gt;up-staged by case law&lt;/a&gt;, our Pediatrician to the Stars has returned for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Attorney Gordon is back, this time on &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/mondays-los-angeles-times_b_188813.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, where he accuses a pro-vaccine doctor of committing “ethics and HIPAA violations so egregious that the Medical Board must take him to task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon is outraged by an April 20 &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-practice20-2009apr20,0,6718127.story"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Rahul Parikh, a Walnut Creek pediatrician, who wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t my first lesson about the importance of vaccines. That had happened a year earlier, when I was an intern at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, half a world away. One night, we admitted a 9-month-old girl who was having trouble breathing. She arrived with her parents — Mom in tears and Dad tense with worry. Her parents were movie stars from a Hollywood borough who, unlike that mother from a Bollywood slum, needed nothing. In a way, they had chosen “nothing” for their daughter from the time she was born — refusing all vaccines for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Too much information!” cries Gordon, who claims that Parikh exposed the patient’s identity in violation of HIPPA regulations which guard patient privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parikh is a well-published medical author and blogger and he speaks of a patient he saw as an intern in the year 2000 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. (His bio on many sites lets you know that year.) He identifies the parents, their unique profession and their child’s age and illness. This family can be identified by anyone who can use Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have given me permission to respond to the LA Times article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he has done is illegal and unethical and violates the family’s and child’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had no noble goals and very little educational intent. He just wants to scare parents and is willing to break the rules and violate medical confidentiality to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even identifies me in his story: “We stuck more needles into her tiny veins, and her doctor performed a spinal tap to make sure she didn’t have bacterial meningitis.” He knows that I’m the only private attending pediatrician who comes to Cedars to do spinal taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take a Philadelphia lawyer to know that Gordon gave more clues to the identity of the movie star couple than did Parikh. He even outed himself as the mysterious midnight spinal tapper, providing yet another clue. “Movie star” may be a unique job title in fly over country, but certainly not in LA, where you can’t swing a dead cat without whacking one upside the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For HIPPA privacy to be breached, patient health information must either identify the individual or disclose information which provides a &lt;a href="http://www.lawyersandhipaa.com/160-103.htm"&gt;reasonable basis&lt;/a&gt; to identify the individual. Identifying the parents of the patient as movie stars from Hollywood is not even close to meeting this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parikh did not identify Gordon as an attending physician, either by specialty or name.  Even if he did, no patient privacy laws would have been broken because in this case it is no more possible to identify the patient through a physician than by identifying the treating hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while no HIPPA violations occurred, our Legal Assistant to the Stars does have legitimate concerns over California’s defamation laws, &lt;a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/california-defamation-law"&gt;which define libel per se as:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a libel which is defamatory of the plaintiff without the necessity of explanatory matter, such as an inducement, innuendo or other extrinsic fact, is said to be libel on its face.   As the court stated in Bates v. Campbell, if the statements have “the natural tendency to injure a person’s reputation” it is libel per se. Bates v. Campbell, (1931) 213 Cal. 438, 441;  Adams v. Cameron, (1915) 27 Cal. App. 625 (1915) (libel per se was found where a train passenger wrote letters stating that the conductor was intoxicated and was loud and vulgar because of his intoxicated state); Slaughter v. Friedman, (1982) 32 Cal. 3d 149.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plaintiff suing for libel per se does not need to prove damages. Parikh’s lawyers need only argue that Gordon’s statements clearly attack their client’s professional reputation and imply that Parikh violated the ethics and laws which govern the way physicians work. Let’s look at Gordon’s accusations again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Parikh) commits ethics and HIPAA violations so egregious that the Medical Board must take him to task” and “What he has done is illegal and unethical and violates the family’s and child’s privacy.” Tough words coming from Gordon. Tougher still to prove them true.&lt;/p&gt;

I know I'm ruining my liberal credentials here, but I frankly don’t have any moral problem with the jury condemning him to death. However, to do so based on the sanctification of a Bronze Age legal code is somewhat horrifying—especially given the list of other "crimes" that are recommended for capital punishment in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, yes, the court assures us that even though bringing the Bible into the sentencing was improper, there is no evidence that it swayed the jury. Rest assured that when the Bible and other authorities (like our judicial system ) are at odds, we can trust Texas jurors to ignore the Bible and do what is right. Even though half the country believes that God made humans in their present form because the Bible says so—we can count on Texans (school boards excepted) to follow the evidence and the constitution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the same, just in case an issue like this should come up in your state, &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/a_christian_conservative/verses.html"&gt;thirty six different offenses&lt;/a&gt; in the Bible qualified for capital punishment. Do any of these apply to you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursing Parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. Leviticus 20:9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working on the Sabbath&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

They shall say to the elders of his town, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard." Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. Deuteronomy 21:18&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worshipping any god but Yahweh&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that . . . hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; . . .Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die. Deuteronomy 17:2-5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witches&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Exodus 22: 18&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizards (epileptics? migraine sufferers? schizophrenics?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. Leviticus 20:27&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loose Daughters of Clergy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. Leviticus 21:9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girls who are Raped within the City Limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man finds her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death; the girl, because she did not cry out in the city . . . But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lies with her shall die. Deuteronomy 22:23-25&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blasphemers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death. Leviticus 24:16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone Who Tries to Deconvert Yahweh Worshipers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If anyone secretly entices you--even if it is your brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your most intimate friend--saying, "Let us go worship other gods," . . . you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them to execute them. Deuteronomy 12:6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men who Lie With Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. Leviticus 20:13&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adulterers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. Leviticus 20: 10-12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men who Lie with Beasts and Beasts who Lie with Men&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. Leviticus 20:15&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. Are you up for the death penalty (along with all those Kiwi sheep)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just so you know, it could be worse. As I am reminded by people who want me to make nice, this list represents an advancement from mob justice. They are right, and the Levitical Code would a fascinating window into human moral history were it not for the fact that juries in Texas, politicians in Colorado, and clergy in Africa all advocate the death penalty for one person or another on the basis of these texts (murderers, homosexuals, and child witches respectively).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people put God’s name on Bronze Age documents, and then make those documents a golden calf, they get stuck with Bronze Age moral thinking. Maybe it’s time to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sins-Scripture-Exposing-Bibles-Reveal/dp/0060762055"&gt;take the Bible down off of its pedestal&lt;/a&gt;, and acknowledge the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060738170"&gt;obvious human handprints &lt;/a&gt;on the texts. Maybe it's even time to do again &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jeffersons-Bible-Morals-Jesus-Nazareth/dp/0929205022"&gt;what Thomas Jefferson did&lt;/a&gt;: cut the book apart, keep the parts that are &lt;a href="http://www.wisdomcommons.org/"&gt;worth keeping&lt;/a&gt;, and leave the rest on the floor in the cutting room of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-3839419313788956009?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to high school with a genius. I don’t mean that he was the&lt;br&gt;
smartest guy in the class. He was a real genius. He could take small&lt;br&gt;
indications from different fields and see the obvious conclusion that&lt;br&gt;
eluded the rest of us. He was the one that the teachers believed would&lt;br&gt;
advance mankind in a great leap forward. He was the Einstein of our&lt;br&gt;
age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was high school. He was smart and not very athletic. He was not&lt;br&gt;
treated well. Looking ahead to adulthood, he saw that he would never&lt;br&gt;
be treated as well as a movie star or a basketball player. He decided&lt;br&gt;
that, if society did not value him, he would not provide value. After&lt;br&gt;
graduation, he taught himself to play guitar, delivered pizza, and&lt;br&gt;
became a darned good gamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query: If a person has the ability to help mankind, is she/he&lt;br&gt;
ethically bound to use that ability? Does the answer change if the&lt;br&gt;
person has invented something - a cure for cancer or a solution to&lt;br&gt;
global warming - and decides not to make it available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240429029102"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9171">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c834393e91b4f1b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="commitment devices"/><title type="html">Real Commitment at the OMB</title><published>2009-04-22T18:52:32Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T18:52:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/real-commitment-at-the-omb/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Rampell&lt;/strong&gt; had a nice post last week over at Economix ("&lt;a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/do-it-or-pay/"&gt;Do It Or Pay&lt;/a&gt;") telling of NPR's recent &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102723682"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Peter Orszag&lt;/strong&gt;, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, in which Orszag talks about writing an exercise contract exactly like what my beloved &lt;a href="http://www.stickk.com/"&gt;stickK.com offers&lt;/a&gt;:</summary><author><name>By Ian Ayres</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240428246548"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/the_earth_day_2009_resolutions.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40bb6d26c1634d32</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">The Earth Day 2009 resolutions meme.</title><published>2009-04-22T16:30:09Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T16:30:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/Ws-PaqBoyuI/the_earth_day_2009_resolutions.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/the_earth_day_2009_resolutions.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/04/earth_day_2009_resolutions_sma.php"&gt;Mike Dunford initiates a meme for Earth Day 2009:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'd like you to take a minute or two to come up with three things that you can do to be more environmentally friendly. The first should be something that's small, and easy to do. The second should be more ambitious - something you'll try to do, but might not manage to pull off. The third should be something you can do to improve something you're already doing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this meme!  No matter what habits you've already cultivated (and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/04/sustainability_starts_with_sus.php"&gt;we've cultivated a few&lt;/a&gt;), there's always room to optimize them.

In that 1969 flick, Elvis was a doctor who believed the child was withdrawn because she had been neglected by her parents. Growing up in Brazil in the 70's and 80's, we watched several repeats of that movie on TV. So that false stereotype is the image of autism that first comes to mind for many people of my generation.  In a country where psychoanalysis is still very popular, it is not an easy feat to spread awareness that autism is not caused by bad parenting, but by genetic, biological factors.  Still, starting in the 1990's, parents of autistic children have made tremendous progress by creating associations and foundations throughout the country, in order to provide information for the public and even treatment--from ABA and TEACCH to residential options for severely affected adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Government has just started to promote some awareness by recently creating an agency in Defense of People with Special Needs (CORDE) under the Human Rights Secretary.  However, there are hardly any governmental programs devoted to autism treatment, except for a few psychiatric facilities and State grants given to parents' associations that offer clinics for people with autism and other disabilities.  The most influential of these associations is &lt;a href="http://www.ama.org.br/html/home.php"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMA-Sao Paulo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the acronym in Portuguese reads like the word "LOVES" and it stands for Association of Friends of the Autistic), located in Brazil's largest city (population: 19 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMA currently offers free therapy for 150 autistic children and teens, mostly ABA- and TEACCH-based, and residential placements. A new branch that will focus on therapy and job training for the severely autistic is slated to open this year. The waiting list in their clinics has people from all over the country and is over one-year long.  There are only 50,000 people officially diagnosed with autism in Brazil at the moment, but specialists consider this number grossly &lt;a href="http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDG77644-8055-473-1,00-UM+NOVO+OLHAR+SOBRE+O+AUTISMO.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;underestimated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that is due to a lack of national studies on incidence/prevalence of the disorder, plus insufficient reporting and awareness from doctors that see autistic kids nationwide. If actual autism rates don't seem to vary from one country to the other, Brazil could have more than 1 million autistics, given that the total population is now over 183 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's one of the reasons why AMA established a partnership with the Sao Paulo School of Medicine where they promote autism education for Med students specializing in Psychiatry. "We have many doctors in the largest cities that are updated in the latest autism studies, but the majority is still lacking knowledge on the disorder and its diagnosis", says Ana Maria Serrajordia de Melo, who founded AMA in 1983, when she realized there were not enough resources available to treat and educate her severely autistic son (now 30 years old).  As a naval engineer, she had no previous experience in the autism field, but she got educated, even taking courses abroad, and joined forces with other parents who were also trying to improve the situation of autism families in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as AMA-Sao Paulo is doing a great job, it can't serve thousands of cases nationwide.  The situation is more critical for families with severely autistic adults who are not accepted in public institutions and who can't afford--or live very far away from00the few private residential facilities available. Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country, has just opened its first county clinic for autism, trying to give autistic people a more differentiated treatment than what they were getting in the public psychiatric hospitals. In the state of Bahia, a very strong parents association fought tooth and nail and was recently able to change the State legislation and ensure treatment for autistic people either in public institutions or private clinics contracted by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public schools in Brazil have typically very little Special Education resources, but two national charitable, non-profit organizations, Pestalozzi and APAE, have schools for people with intellectual disabilities. Inclusion in mainstream classrooms is a fairly new concept encouraged by the federal government, first by law in 1996, and then through a program that started in 2003 to train teachers and educators in 114 cities.  According to psychologist and professor Jose Raimundo Facion, who advocates inclusion, "Brazil's legislation on special ed is good, but the government still doesn't provide enough resources for the schools to make sure that the child will receive adequate education."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Leila Couceiro</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240419380239"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9097">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75995204a61d0d35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="depression"/><category term="food"/><title type="html">Depression Cooking</title><published>2009-04-22T16:42:29Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T16:42:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/SnUXw1AlFQg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/depression-cooking/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">All of Clara's recipes have the same ingredients: potatoes and onions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, I think the site (fourteen studies) so resolutely exposes the dirty underwear of the mainstream’s weak science on the vaccine-autism debate that most critiques of the site seem to center around the idea that “you have no need to go look at the site, and please pay no attention to the dirty underwear behind the curtain…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he starts by saying that those who critique the site are trying to divert attention from it, rather than make a substantive analysis.  This is the central and profound hypocrisy of his article - for then he launches into a series of personal attacks against my credibility and never addresses the substance of my critique (except for one point, which he fails to get right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His accusation is also false. My blog entry at Science-Based Medicine was a follow up to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by David Gorski, who wrote an extensive and detailed substantive critique of both the methods and some of the specific conclusions of the fourteen studies site. I then extended David’s critique with some analysis of my own, adding analysis of one more study that David did not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At no point did either of us try to discourage anyone from looking at the fourteen studies site for themselves, and in fact we linked to it. This demonstrates that Handley, who cannot engage in a substantive debate on this issue, will rather just make up whatever fake criticisms he can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal attacks begin softly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at his biography on wikipedia (which he undoubtedly wrote himself), he became a doctor 11 years ago and turns 45 years old this July. It doesn’t appear that autism, vaccines, immunology, toxicology, nutrition, or gastroenterology are part of his area of focus, expertise, or study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it when people express certainty about a fact that is demonstrably false.  This is a small point in itself, but it reveals Handley’s intellectual laziness and clear bias. He tries to imply something about my ego by expressing his lack of doubt that I wrote &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Novella"&gt;my wikipedia entry &lt;/a&gt;myself. Apparently Handley lacks the internet chops or the minimal intellectual curiosity it would have taken to click the “history” tab on my wikipedia page. If he had he would have seen that the entry was contributed to by many people, but not at all by me. This is just more evidence that his diatribe is about character assassination (even if he has to make stuff up), and not substantive analysis or criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then comments that,  “It doesn’t appear that autism, vaccines, immunology, toxicology, nutrition, or gastroenterology are part of his area of focus, expertise, or study.” This is partly true - these areas are not part of my focus or expertise - nor have I ever claimed that they were. I do treat neuroimmunological disease as part of my neuromuscular focus, so it is not entirely true for immunology (but I am not an immunologist - expertise is relative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not accurate to say these topics are not part of my study - I have indeed studied all of them in medical school and beyond.  I also have a side career as a popularizer of science and science-based medicine, and in that role I make a point to study any topic I write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear - I have never made any argument from authority. I have never asked my readers to accept any of my claims because of my expertise. I discuss logic and evidence and my analysis stands or falls on its own merits. I am also open to substantive discussion from anyone without ever even inquiring into their background or training, taking their arguments at face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is Handley even bringing up my areas of expertise? He must be making the argument that expertise matters, that we should therefore respect the opinion of experts who do focus in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. He later writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not intellectually intimidated by any of these jokers. Their degrees mean zippo to me, because I knew plenty of knuckleheads in college who went on to be doctors, and they’re still knuckleheads (I also knew plenty of great, smart guys who went on to be doctors and they’re still great, smart guys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose a different path and went into the business world. In the business world, having a degree from a great college or business school gets you your first job, and not much else. There are plenty of Harvard Business School grads who have bankrupted companies and gone to jail, and plenty of high school drop-outs who are multi-millionaires. Brains and street-smarts win, not degrees, arrogance, or entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently degrees and expertise do not mean anything to Handley. Handley should get his story straight.  He does not seem concerned with his self-contradiction. He smoothly transitions from saying I lack expertise to making the “elitism” gambit that expertise does not matter - only street smarts matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an old ploy we have heard from con-artists for centuries - “don’t listen to people who actually know what they are talking about, listen to me, I have street smarts.” The beauty of “street smarts” as a criterion is that Handley can define that any way he wants, and apparently he defines it as people who agree with him. Handley would have you believe that his utter lack of scientific training is not relevant, but my lack of expertise in autism (even though I am a neurologist) is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he’s not done with the elitism gambit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been astonished by the culture of arrogance and elitism that medical schools appear to breed in their doctors and scientists. The culture tends to produce an “us vs. them” mentality, where doctors collectively back each other up on controversial issues, typically without understanding the issue for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually (genuinely) controversial issues are controversial because doctors and scientists fight over them, they don’t back each other up. Handley has apparently never been to a scientific meeting, or wasn’t paying attention as the scientists fought like cats and dogs over their respective positions. My favorite thing about the culture of science is that it is ultimately a meritocracy of ideas and evidence. Yes it is fraught with human failings, but the culture respects logic and evidence more than any other human culture, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley accusing scientists of arrogance is also precious - what is more arrogant than thinking you are smarter, more virtuous, and better informed than an entire profession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - please read Handley’s article and the comments and then decide for yourself who is propagating an “us vs them” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we get to some discussion of vaccines and autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children receive 36 vaccines by the age of 5 in the United States. Of those 36 vaccines, 2 have ever been studied for their possible relationship, the two doses of the MMR. But, children receive 23 vaccine BEFORE THEIR FIRST MMR SHOT, and no work whatsoever has been done to consider these other vaccines and their relationship to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s website, vaccines contain 53 separate ingredients, but only 1 – thimerosal – has ever been looked at in terms of its relationship to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Handley saying here - is this tacit agreement that the evidence does not support a link between MMR or thimerosal and vaccines?  Why not admit that openly, if one is being intellectually honest? But he is probably not suggesting that, although he should have been clear that he still thinks MMR and/or thimerosal are the culprits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we see here the anti-vaccine strategy, which is deliberately ignorant of history. In the past 15 years or so the anti-vaccine movement was absolutely certain that MMR caused autism. When that hypothesis did not pan out, then they shifted focus to thimerosal. That hypothesis is now dead, so they are moving on to the other ingredients in vaccines. It’s endless, and clearly all they care about is blaming vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim is also demonstrably not true. Vaccine safety is closely monitored, and there are many published studies of vaccine safety - not just for MMR or thimerosal. Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vsd/vsd_publications.htm"&gt;list of such studies&lt;/a&gt; on the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He comes back to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Dr. Novella. His critique of FourteenStudies.org seems to be largely based on the naïve idea that his colleagues couldn’t possibly be mistaken on this issue, which means that I must be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then quotes me from my SBM blog article saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is also remarkable that Handley himself quotes many professional, expert, and advisory bodies who also have read the studies and concluded that they overwhelmingly support the conclusion of a lack of correlation between vaccines and autism - including the Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, The American Medical Association, the Institute of Medicine, and the March of Dimes. Handley casually and self-servingly assumes that all of the professionals in these organizations are incompetent or they are lying.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And keep in mind what it would mean to lie on this issue - Handley believes that many doctors who have chosen the career path of public health are deliberately condemning millions of children to autism simply to avoid admitting past error, because they cannot face the horrible truth, or to receive their Big Pharma kickbacks. It’s no wonder their rhetoric often become hysterical - they really believe this is going on. For some reason it is easier for them to believe this astounding horrible claim than even consider the possibility that perhaps they have misinterpreted the science and that trained experts who have dedicated their lives to understanding the science may know better. This is what we call the ‘arrogance of ignorance.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again Handley is wrong - my criticism of fourteen studies was not based upon the assumption that my colleagues cannot be wrong. My criticism (combined with David Gorski’s) was based upon a thorough analysis of their methods and claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point above was not a criticism of fourteen studies, but rather a criticism of Handley for behavior that he repeats in his new post. I am saying that Handley believes that he must be correct, even if that means that hundreds if not thousands of physicians and scientists are corrupt or inept. I think Handley has again shown that my observation is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrogance of ignorance? Dr. Novella asserts, &lt;em&gt;“I personally know of many people, including myself and David, who have both read all the studies and are telling the truth about our opinions that they do not support a link between autism and vaccines.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He’s read the studies. The ones that cover 2 of 36 vaccines, 1 of 53 ingredients, never consider unvaccinated kids, and are almost all funded by conflicted parties and they clearly show ALL VACCINES don’t cause autism? And I’m the ignorant one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Handley, you are. You failed to accurately read or represent what I wrote.  Scientists learn to be careful and unambiguous in their writing. I said the evidence does not support a link between autism and vaccines. Handley interprets this as “clearly show ALL VACCINES don’t cause autism.” This is not being pedantic - a lack of evidence for is not the same as evidence against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only my opinion but that of the scientific community that the evidence does not support a link between vaccines and autism. You cannot prove a negative, that vaccines play no role in autism, you can only say that the evidence available so far cannot be used to conclude that there is a link. So any link is likely to be smaller than the power of the current evidence to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I shouldn’t try to confuse Handley with my elitist “sciency” logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting close to Handley’s one substantive point. Be patient. He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in making his point, this is the only study Dr. Novella points to. To summarize, Dr. Novella demonstrates an incomprehensible level of ignorance in the following four ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. He argues that I suffer from the “arrogance of ignorance” because many of his self-interested colleagues disagree with me and they must surely be right. Do I really need to cite the thousands of examples in human history where the consensus of the day turned out to be wrong? He calls himself a “skeptic” but I’m wrong because his friends think I’m wrong and surely my brain is not as big as theirs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loves the elitism gambit. I never argued Handley is wrong because his views go against the mainstream - I argued he is arrogant because he has more faith in his street smarts than the training and years of dedicated study of thousands of experts.  Handley is wrong because his arguments are factually and logically challenged - his arguments do not stand up under scrutiny. Again - he largely ignores the substantive analysis that David and I did and chooses rather to engage is character assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. He cites a study that solely looks at the relationship between thimerosal and autism (1 of 53 ingredients in vaccines) as PROOF that “vaccines do not cause autism.” This is a reckless over-generalization that has no basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again - see above. I never said it was proof, just an analysis does not support a link. I also was not relying upon this one study. Handley has to be willfully misrepresenting my entry, in which I sated clearly that it was a follow up to David’s post which discussed the methods and several other specific studies. I also have written about many of these studies in separate blog entries, easily discoverable with a Google search or by searching on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Of all studies, he chooses to defend the Madsen Denmark study (see above) that has without question the most egregious data-trick ever used in a thimerosal-autism study, and a study that has even been discredited by the CDC and NIEHS as “unhelpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only chose this study because David analyzed many of the other studies. We had agreed to divvy up the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley does not provide a link or reference for his quote. The CDC still lists this study as part of the evidence for lack of an association between thimerosal and autism. &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdfhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-feb07.pdf"&gt;In this recent review&lt;/a&gt; they write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ecological study in Denmark analyzed data from almost 1,000 children diagnosed with autism over 30 years. Thimerosal was used in childhood vaccines from the early fifties until 1992, and there was no trend for an increase in autism up through 1990. From 1991 to 2000, the incidence of autism increased, after thimerosal was discontinued from vaccines, suggesting no relationship between thimerosal and autism in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this one study does not by itself provide compelling evidence for a lack of correlation - no one study does. The totality of the evidence is what is compelling. And there are legitimate criticisms of this data. But what it shows is that autism rates failed to decrease in Denmark when the total dose of thimerosal was decreased in 1971 (a point ignored by fourteen studies). It also showed that the increase in autism diagnoses in the 1990’s in Denmark could not have been due to thimerosal since thimerosal was removed entirely from vaccines prior to the increase. Therefore something else was responsible for the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. He states that “autism rates were similar” between the US and Denmark. Yet, a fifth grader could look at the Madsen study he himself cites and read on page 605 of the study that the autism rate in Denmark was under 5 per 10,000, while the U.S. rate is somewhere between 60-100 per 10,000, which means our rate of autism is 12-20 times higher than Denmark’s, which would mean our rates are “similar”, so long as you define similar as the U.S. rate being twenty times the rate of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley makes two significant mistakes here. The first is that he is comparing the &lt;em&gt;incidence&lt;/em&gt; of autism in one age group in Denmark with the &lt;em&gt;prevalence&lt;/em&gt; of autism in the US. Incidence is the number of new cases over a period of time, and prevalence is the total number of cases at any point in time. Prevalence for a chronic condition is always much greater than incidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley’s hypothetical 5th grader might see autism “rates” rather than an incidence or prevalence, because (like Handley) they lack scientific training or careful scholarship.  This is simply a rookie mistake on the part of Handley (so much for street smarts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, autism prevalence in Denmark is very similar to the autism prevalence in the US (&lt;a href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/162/12/1150"&gt;about 80 per 10,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2000). If Handley does not publicly admit or refute his clear mistake here, then that would provide further evidence of his intellectual dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also missed my point - in both the US and Denmark autism incidence were flat until the early 1990s when they began to steadily increase. In the US the vaccine schedule was increasing over this time, and thimerosal would not be removed until 2002. In Denmark thimerosal had just been removed, and vaccine rates were different than in the US, as Handley himself points out. Yet the change in autism diagnoses behaved the same over time, and with similar absolute numbers. The common element was not thimerosal, but rather diagnostic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this profound display of scientific ignorance Handley writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vaccines and autism, his “critique” of FourteenStudies.org demonstrates an unacceptable level of ignorance, non-critical thinking, and parroting of the words of others. My only guess for why Dr. Novella would publish such rubbish is that he knows his friends demonstrating similarly narrow and misguided views will tell him how smart he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have clearly demonstrated who is ignorant and who has critical thinking on their side. Handley then conveniently repeats the behavior that I was criticizing above - casually assuming that those who disagree with him suffer from some critical vice - in this case a fragile ego. This is Handleys “only guess.” He really needs to expand his intellectual repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more. Handley then includes an appendix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Dr. Novella does appear to have expertise at injecting the botulinum toxin in people’s bodies, as his webpage characterizes this as an area of expertise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow - the Botox gambit.  How pathetic. He then lists the uses of Botox and descriptions of its potential for toxicity, as if this somehow impugns my character or judgment as a phsician. This is really low. First of all, I do not use Botox for cosmetic purposes, only for neurological purposes, for which its use is clearly established as the standard of care. But he tries to make some tortured argument that I use Botox, and Botox is used for cosmetic purposes, and therefore… What, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is then impressed with what a toxin Botox is (uh, yes, it’s right there in the name - botulinum toxin). And yes there have been severe side effects (although he missed the fact that they were all in children and I don’t treat children, but this is not really important).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Mr. Handley, medical interventions have risks and side effects. But those who are familiar with clinical decision making understand that treatment decisions are based upon risk vs benefit. Botox, when used properly, has a very good risk vs benefit profile, and is extremely safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really one of the most childish and ignorant scare tactics I have seen. And again I point it out to reveal the intellectual behavior of Handley and the anti-vaccine movement. Just astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I encourage my readers to look at the comments left by readers of Handley’s blog. It reveals the culture of hatred, paranoia, and personal attacks that is being fostered by Handley and his cohorts. But bring a machete to cut through the irony.&lt;/p&gt;

We should probably all be outside celebrating Spring (or Fall, for those upside-down). But if you insist on remaining indoors, glued to a computer screen, here are two things of note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, befitting Earth Day, there’s a &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-15-09.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery of an Earth-sized planet (well, at least double the size, but that’s essentially identical by astronomical standards). The orbital period is 3 days, which means it is way too close to its sun to harbor life. But it’s just a matter of time before we find another Earth. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/science/22planet.html?hpw"&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; has a direct link to the (unpublished, unrefereed) &lt;a href="http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/Gl581_preprint.pdf"&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;; I guess your average NYTimes reader is expected to be able to follow an original scientific article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/tree.jpg" title="tree"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/tree.jpg" alt="tree" width="220"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Second, there’s an &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2009/04/inevitable_mind.php"&gt;interesting blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Kelly on how Nature produces “intelligence” (hat-tip to Mike Warren). The article describes how trees can “see” their environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light reflected from nearby vegetation is richer in far-red wavelengths than unreflected light. Plants can use this information to not only see shade, but to anticipate the likelihood of shading by a competitor in the future. “When a change in the balance of red to far-red radiation is perceived,” says Trewavas, “an integrated adaptive response in phenotype structure [of the plant] results. New branches grow away from the putative competitor, stem growth is increased; the rate of branching diminishes, and such branches assume a more vertical direction: leaf area increases in anticipation of reduced incident flux; and the number of layers of leaf cells containing chlorophyll diminishes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s what rock ants (with 100,000 neurons) can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the potential of a new nesting site, rock ants will measure the dimensions of the room in total darkness and then calculate – and that is the proper word – the volume and desirability of it. For many millions of years, rock ants have used a mathematical trick that was only discovered by humans in 1733. Rock ants can estimate the volume of a space, even an irregular shaped one, by randomly laying a scent trail across the floor of the space, “recording” the length of that line, and then counting the number of times it encounters that scented line during additional diagonal runs across the floor. The calculated area is inversely proportional to the frequency of intersections times length. In other words, the ants discovered an approximate value for Π derived by intersecting diagonals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post then goes on to speculate about the minds we’re building into our technology. It gets a little science-fictiony for my taste, but one interesting site it links to is &lt;a href="http://www.20q.net/"&gt;20 questions&lt;/a&gt;. It’s quite entertaining, and can be eerily accurate. But stop playing the game, and go outside and take a long walk. And remember, the trees are watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite more than 20 years of eradication efforts, two strains of polio have spread out from northern Nigeria and northern India — both places where many Muslims have resisted vaccines because of rumors that vaccine efforts are a Western plot to sterilize them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this nonsense is not confined to wild-eyed, third-world imams. A Springfield, Illinois radiologist, Dr. David Ayoub, has been telling audiences for years that the  World Health Organization uses vaccines to sterilize poor women in third world countries. In this &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/cpommq"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; Ayoub attacks the Global Alliance for Vaccination Initiatives (GAVI), and asks “Are powerful forces really trying to help the poor people or could it be for another agenda; the sterilization of the poor?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among &lt;a href="http://www.gavialliance.org/about/in_partnership/gates/index.php"&gt;GAVI’s founding partners&lt;/a&gt; is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the vaccines, and saved millions of young lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, Ayoub has a following in America’s homegrown anti-vaccine movement, and is a regular at anti-vaccine conferences, such as the AutismOne conference in Chicago last May. A Columbia, Missouri television news program &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K73rJxQdMW8"&gt;has featured him as a vaccine expert&lt;/a&gt; without mentioning his penchant for improbable conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

Complaints have already been raised about the ridiculously high scholarships that they have instituted for a small number of awardees ($50K, or about twice the operating grant for many new labs) and the requirement for SSHRC to focus on business-related programs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other significant change that I don't know has been discussed widely is the cut to the MSc graduate scholarship duration by NSERC.  It used to be that both the MSc and PhD scholarships were for 2 years (and you could get both, for 4 years of funding overall).  No one does a PhD in science in 2 years, so it is good that this has finally been extended to 3 years.  However, the MSc scholarship has now been cut to 1 year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone who does a PhD in Canada either completes an MSc first or transfers from the MSc to the PhD directly. Many students complete the MSc and move on to non-academic careers, so there are far more MSc students than PhD students.   In other words, whether they will finish with an MSc or go on to a PhD, all recruitment decisions of graduate students involve admission to an MSc program at some point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scholarships are an important supplement to operating grants which, as everyone now knows, are small in Canada and mostly are used to fund students and their research (if you have $30K, $25K may be spent on salaries for 2 MSc students, for example).  If a student can obtain a scholarship, he or she is essentially "free" to an advisor because the stipend is then paid. This makes it much more likely that a student will get into a lab of his or her choice, and it also increases the number of students who can be trained.  However, if the funding is only available for 1 year, then an advisor has to decide whether he or she can afford the second year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cutting the MSc scholarship to 1 year will, I predict, significantly reduce the positive impact that the program has at the MSc level.  It may also indirectly affect the PhD level by causing advisors to suggest that students transfer to the PhD even if they are not really qualified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is another effect that will surely arise.  In addition to the NSERC scholarship program, students in Ontario can seek funding from the Ontario Graduate Scholarships (OGS) program.  Most students apply to both.  Generally speaking, if a student receives an NSERC they also get an OGS, as the latter is slightly less competitive.  However, a student can only accept one, which means that NSERC and OGS fund different students and therefore increase the total number with support.  Now that NSERC is 1 year, scholarship holders will no doubt be applying for OGS for the second year.  This means that the pool of applicants will soon include former NSERC winners along with new applicants for OGS.

I'm on my way to Oregon (I'm at the airport already, so don't worry about any more accidents!), so I may be a bit quiet for a while. Which means I should put something here to keep everyone in a busy uproar for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is done, and Jerry Coyne has done the dirty work for me. He has put up a &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/"&gt;long post criticizing the accommodationist stance of several pro-evolution organizations, particularly the NCSE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among professional organizations that defend the teaching of evolution, perhaps the biggest offender in endorsing the harmony of science and faith is The National Center for Science Education.  Although one of their officers told me that their official position on faith was only that "we will not criticize religions," a perusal of their website shows that this is untrue.  Not only does the NCSE not criticize religion, but it cuddles up to it, kisses it, and tells it that everything will be all right.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the rest of this post I'd like to explore the ways that, I think, the NCSE has made accommodationism not only its philosophy, but its official philosophy. This, along with their endorsement and affiliation with supernaturalist scientists, philosophers, and theologians, inevitably corrupts their mission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let me first affirm that I enormously admire the work of the NCSE and of its director, Eugenie Scott and its president, Kevin Padian.  They have worked tirelessly to keep evolution in the schools and creationism out, most visibly in the Dover trial.  But they're also active at school-board hearings and other venues throughout the country, as well as providing extensive resources for the rest of us in the battle for Darwin.   They are the good guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give it ten enthusiastic thumbs up, not just for the deserved criticism but also for the praise given to the NCSE&amp;#39;s efforts. As Coyne explains, they are trying to have it both ways, arguing that science is a secular enterprise, but at the same time leaning over backwards to incorporate theological arguments, an act of political pragmatism that compromises their mission. It&amp;#39;s a failed strategy that is leading us down a dangerous path — I already feel that there is an unfortunate atmosphere that favors scientists with religious leanings over the more sensible majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also includes a marvelous quote from Charles Darwin. As I&amp;#39;ve said many times, Darwin was not an atheist, but an agnostic, and that he refused to engage in conflict with religion…a sentiment that I think is fair and a personal choice, and one that I think the NCSE wants to follow as well (which I would think is also a reasonable strategy). However, by favoring theism as much as they have, they have broken away from the spirit of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I entirely reject, as in my judgment quite unnecessary, any subsequent addition 'of new powers and attributes and forces,' or of any 'principle of improvement, except in so far as every character which is naturally selected or preserved is in some way an advantage or improvement, otherwise it would not have been selected. If I were convinced that I required such additions to the theory of natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish. . . I would give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural Selection, if it requires miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that what Darwin is rejecting in that statement is what we now call theistic evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freely admit to being anti-religious myself, and I would agree that an organization trying to represent all of science and promoting science education does not have to be on the same page with me (and maybe even ought not to be), but the NCSE, NAS, and AAAS have all been erring in the opposite direction, jumping merrily into bed with every evangelical god-botherer who blows them a kiss. If they are going to snub the raging new atheists in the name of religious neutrality, they should be similarly divorcing themselves from Christian apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3767,Truckling-to-the-Faithful-A-Spoonful-of-Jesus-Helps-Darwin-Go-Down,Jerry-Coyne#368197"&gt;Richard Dawkins has weighed in&lt;/a&gt;…and asks whether we should take the gloves off in dealing with the accommodationist position. Too late! They&amp;#39;re off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/trouble-with-ncse.html"&gt;Larry Moran shares a similar view&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people seem to be misinterpreting Coyne&amp;#39;s article — it actually makes much the same point I have in talks over the last year. The science classroom must remain &lt;i&gt;secular&lt;/i&gt; — that is, it is not a place to endorse atheism or theism, or for those conflicts to take place. We should be teaching about science and science only, and let the implications of that science on culture be discussed freely &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt;. Organizations like the NCSE and the NAS and AAAS are supposed to be defenders of that secularism. Nobody is asking them to promote atheism. What we're objecting to is that they have gone too far in mollycoddling theistic views, and have falsely represented science as being congenial to religious interpretations, to the point where godless explanations are being actively excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know they have a very narrow path they have to walk to be diplomatic and try to gather popular support for science education. The point is that they are wobbling off the tightrope to court the faithful — and the science they are trying to encourage is looking less and less secular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/jerry_coyne_lobs_another_bomb.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0uVunWkGcWc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240414702805"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/bad_joke_bad_poll.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae6571318692f66a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Bad joke, bad poll</title><published>2009-04-22T15:50:39Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T15:50:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/L7HSV7SQb0w/bad_joke_bad_poll.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/bad_joke_bad_poll.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an old, tired joke that has just been posted on the site of a &lt;a href="http://www.kfab.com/pages/voorhees.html"&gt;right-wing moron's radio show&lt;/a&gt;.  I have heard it quite a few times before, usually by smug nitwits who think they've delivered a knock-out themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A United States Marine was attending some college courses between assignments.  He had completed missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  One of the courses had a professor who was an avowed atheist and a member of the ACLU.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One day the professor shocked the class when he came in, looked to the ceiling, and flatly stated, "God, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you exactly 15 minutes."
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The lecture room fell silent.  You could hear a pin drop.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ten minutes went by and the professor proclaimed, '"Here I am God. I'm still waiting."  It got down to the last couple of minutes when the Marine got out of his chair, went up to the professor, and cold-cocked him, knocking him off the platform. The professor was out cold.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Marine went back to his seat and sat there, silently. The other students were shocked, stunned, and sat there looking on in silence.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The professor eventually came to, noticeably shaken, looked at the Marine and asked, "What the heck is the matter with you?  Why did you do that?"
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Marine calmly replied, "God was too busy today protecting American soldiers who are protecting your right to say stupid stuff and act like an idiot.  So, He sent me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; this joke. It's a perfect illustration of the problem of religion. Set aside the inane caricature of a college professor made by someone who has apparently never met one, and look at the 'hero', the Marine. There is no reason to believe he is actually on a mission from a god, other than that he claims it. And he has used this claim to justify violence. Isn't this the way it always is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's revise the joke. Substitute "radio show host" for "college professor", and in the opening paragraphs, describe him as reactionary patriot waving the flag for god and country and demanding that his god strike him down if sending men to war wasn't a righteous cause. Then have the Marine's actions play out in exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still funny? Maybe funnier? Or do you still think the Marine should still be arrested for assault?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I like the joke. It reveals the ignorance of the people who tell it, and it says much about how much of religion is an exercise in rationalizing criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That site also has a poll attached to it. You can tell the man is an amoral jerk by the way it's worded, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the terrorists who planned the 9/11 hijackings is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.  While in CIA custody, newly released documents reflect that the Ron Jeremy-lookalike was waterboarded 183 times, far more than previously admitted to by government officials under the Bush Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kfab.com/pages/voorhees.html"&gt;You Hear This Information and Think What?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who freakin' cares? He's lucky we didn't attach jumper cables to his nads.
84.62 %&lt;br&gt;
It's horrible, but we needed to do it to prevent further American deaths.
5.98 %&lt;br&gt;
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and others should be going to jail over this.
9.40 %&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That our country has engaged in torture is one of the great shames of our generation; that we still have these thugs &lt;i&gt;bragging&lt;/i&gt; about it is a continuing disgrace. Show them what you think—the people who find this behavior vile &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; speak up and act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example of the bad guys: Don Patton preening smarmily and accusing Darwinism of failing because a &amp;#39;prediction&amp;#39; had failed. The &amp;#39;prediction&amp;#39;, as he presents it, is that the fossil record would disgorge a complete accounting of all of evolution…and he can quote biologists from Darwin to Eldredge saying that such a complete series has not been found. He ignores the fact that the actual scientific prediction that the fossil record would always be spotty and incomplete, and most importantly, that there are multiple lines of evidence supporting the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QbeIIH8CADg%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter that, here's historian Abigail Lustig. Notice that right off the bat what she does is point out the distinction between common descent and the mechanism of natural selection, and that more than fossils were involved: biogeography, sysematics, comparative anatomy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/08zw7jkLZf4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also something to emphasize: she&amp;#39;s a historian. The creationist assault on education is not confined to just biology—they have targeted every discipline that challenges their claim of Christian superiority and the infallibility of religious belief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/annals_of_the_texas_board_of_e.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/AYQ3ensTIrg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240414534444"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9349">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/adf726af3c72c30e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="football"/><title type="html">Is the Top N.F.L.

At 5 Earth masses, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_581_c" rel="external "&gt;Gliese 581c&lt;/a&gt; was not exactly a second Earth, but it and 7 Earth mass &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_581_d" rel="external "&gt;Gliese 581d&lt;/a&gt; captured the worlds imagination as they seemed to be in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone" rel="external "&gt;habitable zone&lt;/a&gt; of their parent star, where liquid water can exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the smallest mass planet ever has been discovered around Gliese 581, a 1.9 mass planet Gliese 581e, presumably rocky, that screams around Gliese 581 in a little over three days.  At a mere 0.03 Astronomical Units from its star,  Gliese 581e is a Mercury-like world, baking in the close embrace of the Red Dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the orbit for Gliese 581d has been refined too. It is now definitely within the habitable zone of its star. Gliese 581d is likely very unlike Earth, and it and Gliese 581c are probably &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2007/06/what-will-etxrasolar-planetary.html" rel="external "&gt;water worlds&lt;/a&gt;. The refinement of the orbit of 581d means it is very-likely covered in liquid water, when the planet was first described it seemed more likely it would be an &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2007/06/so-is-gliese-581-c-really-venus-like.html" rel="external "&gt;ice world&lt;/a&gt; (but Gliese 581c is more likely to be &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2007/06/so-is-gliese-581-c-really-venus-like.html" rel="external "&gt;Venus-lik&lt;/a&gt;e).&lt;/p&gt;

You can go there virtually though if you have the 3D space rending program &lt;a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/" rel="external "&gt;Celestia&lt;/a&gt;,  I have made an ssc file for the &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2007/04/gliese-581-c-our-first-terrestrial.html" rel="external "&gt;Gliese 581 system&lt;/a&gt;. If you have Celestia 1.5 and above, the program already comes with Gliese 591b, c and d (you will have to comment b and c out in my file, and comment out d in the extrasolar.ssc file as it has the old orbit).&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, we have methods for hiding them, usually by making them really tiny, but then we need to ask:  Why are they tiny?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Johnson, Lisa Randall and I just came out with a paper that takes a partial stab at this question:  &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3115"&gt;Dynamical Compactification from de Sitter Space.&lt;/a&gt;  (And a similar-sounding paper came out the same day from &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3106"&gt;Jose Blanco-Pillado, Delia Schwartz-Perlov,  and Alex Vilenkin&lt;/a&gt;.)  It’s an intriguing idea, if I do say so myself:  starting with nothing more complicated than a higher-dimensional spacetime with a positive vacuum energy and an electromagnetic field (or a higher-dimensional generalization thereof), you will &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; get quantum fluctuations into lower-dimensional spacetimes!  If we really believe in extra dimensions, we need to understand how regions with different effective dimensionalities are cosmologically related, and this is a step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/04/n521744739_5657.jpg" alt="Matt Johnson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I’d blog all about it, but on this occasion we’re outsourcing to a guest blogger.  My collaborator &lt;a href="http://physics.ucsc.edu/~mjohnson/"&gt;Matt Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is a postdoc at Caltech, and before that was a grad student at UC Santa Cruz, where he worked with Anthony Aguirre — a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/03/28/the-foundational-questions-institute-anthony-aguirre/"&gt;previous guest-blogger&lt;/a&gt; of ours!  We like to keep things in the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra dimensions. Sounds preposterous at first. Well, perhaps more accurately, it sounds preposterous to most people who don’t do high-energy theory. But, really I assure you, there are many well-motivated reasons why us wacky theorists like to ponder the existence of extra dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, as shown long ago by Kaluza and Klein, it is possible to get Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism in four dimensions by taking 5 dimensional General Relativity and wrapping one of the spatial dimensions up in a circle too small to see. The smaller the circle is, the harder it is to move in this “other  direction,” and so there is no danger in getting lost on the way home. In this way, Maxwell’s equations have an elegant geometrical origin and gravity and electricity &amp;amp; magnatism are combined into one force (5 dimensional gravity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strong motivation comes from string theory, which is only a consistent quantum theory of gravity if there are 10 or 11 dimensions in total. Again, since we don’t see them, it is necessary to hide the existence of the extra dimensions. Inspired by the fact that it was possible to hide one extra dimension by wrapping it up in a circle, generally the extra 6 or 7 dimensions are thought to be “compactified” into a very small compact geometry like a sphere or a torus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the five-year-old in the audience is insistently asking, “If you have all these extra dimensions, and you are telling me that they are wrapped up into this tiny ball, how did they get wrapped up in the first place? Why are the four dimensions we see so large, and the others so small?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly a century of thinking about the existence of extra dimensions, there are surprisingly few plausible answers to this very simple question. One of the few answers was proposed by &lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=NUPHA,B316,391"&gt;Brandenberger and Vafa&lt;/a&gt;. They studied the thermodynamics of strings in a torus-shaped hot early-universe, and found that miraculously it is favorable for only four of the dimensions to become large. Pretty nice, if the universe is a torus and all the dimensions started out small and compact. But, it would be nice to have some alternatives in case this turns out not to be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll, Lisa Randall, and I recently &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3115"&gt;wrote a paper&lt;/a&gt; that revisits the five-year-old’s question. We wanted to start with the very simplest model that has extra dimensions and solutions in which some of them can be compactified. A minimal set of ingredients needed to accomplish this includes 1) D-dimensional gravity, 2) a positive D-dimensional cosmological constant, and 3) a (D-4)-form gauge field (think E&amp;amp;M, but with more indices). This theory has long been known to have solutions where 4 of the dimensions are non-compact and (D-4) of them correspond to directions on a sphere, whose size is stabilized by the energetics of curvature and a background Electric or Magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, we showed that some of the spacetimes that are solutions to this theory contain a four-dimensional universe that lives behind the event horizon of an extended object, a “p-brane” or “black brane,” that is embedded in a background D-dimensional spacetime. Moreover, there are mechanisms that dynamically give rise to such objects, thanks to the magic of quantum mechanics, and this leads to an explanation for why some number of extra dimensions became compact!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds complicated, but you can actually go a long way towards understanding what we did by considering plain-old four dimensional black holes.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/22/making-extra-dimensions-disappear/#more-2324"&gt;(more…)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, this isn’t a story. Mitchell isn’t saying anything new, and it’s certainly not surprising that CNN would write this fluff piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about this before: Mitchell is an Apollo hero, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/26/ed-mitchell-going-to-the-moon-doesnt-mean-youre-right/"&gt;but that doesn’t give him any authority at all when it comes to flying saucers&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/30/followup-ed-mitchell-and-ufo-believers/"&gt;he still has no real evidence at all for his claims&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a rehash of the same tired old stories, and there aren’t even blurry photos for this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this isn’t news in any sense, and the article itself is a tad hysterical. I love the quotation from the UFO believer who says that UFOs are the &amp;quot;third rail of politics&amp;quot;, that is, a topic no one wants to touch. That’s actually true, but not because no politician dares risk the ire of the shadow government that controls the saucer fleet. It’s because no politician wants to look like a fool discussing it. Or at least very few do; it may not have cost Kucinich the Democratic nod in the Presidential race, but it &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; didn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, spare me the same tired stories, the fuzzy videos, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/02/how-easy-is-it-to-fool-ufo-believers-easy-if-you-have-a-flare-for-it/"&gt;the pilots who think balloons are alien spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, and all the rest.

Examples abound, for instance homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, the former of which is nothing more than sympathetic magic prettied up with science-y sounding terms and the latter of which is nothing more than faith healing given a New Age mystic slant based on Eastern mysticism and religion rather than Christianity. Indeed, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; was even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/noooo_not_quackademic_medicine_at_my_old.php"&gt;inspired by stories of Jesus' healing powers&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a trip into the wilderness for fasting and prayer, resulting in revelation. Another example is acupuncture, a modality that is seemingly more popular than ever, even invading the very sanctum sanctorum of the ivory towers of academic medicine and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php"&gt;hard-nosed halls of military hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, yet every study of which that is done under rigorous conditions with proper placebo controls shows it to be no more efficacious than a placebo. It's easy enough to shake one's head and chalk it all up to irrationality, ignorance of science, or even religious faith. However, I've always been dissatisfied with such glib explanations, even though admittedly I have myself used them on occasion--or even to what I like to refer to as "burnin' stupid."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why a study released last week in PLoS One by Mark M. Tanaka, Jeremy R. Kendal, Kevin N. Laland out of the Evolution &amp;amp; Ecology Research Centre, School of Biotechnology &amp;amp; Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, the Department of Anthropology, University of Durham, and the School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Fife, respectively, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005192"&gt;From Traditional Medicine to Witchcraft: Why Medical Treatments Are Not Always Efficacious&lt;/a&gt;. Besides loving the title, I also like the methodology, which in essence adapts the tools of modeling evolution and the spread of traits throughout a population and asks the question: Why do ineffective or even harmful (or, as the authors characterize them, "maladaptive") treatments for various illnesses and conditions persist in human populations? The results that the model shows are surprising and counterintuitive, yet to me they ring true. In essence, the authors show, using (mostly) reasonable assumptions that the most efficacious self-treatments are not always the ones that spread through a population and that even harmful treatments can spread. Both of these observations are entirely plausible based on the prevalence of usage of common woo and quackery, and what the authors have done, in essence, is to model mathematically why quackery persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the authors set the stage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/a_mathematical_model_for_the_persistence.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/a_mathematical_model_for_the_persistence.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/l-uKWUET5cA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240407480101"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/anthro_blog_carnival_43.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f0da82578677bb4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Anthro Blog Carnival</title><published>2009-04-22T13:20:19Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T13:20:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/1f-Fe1Sw2Iw/anthro_blog_carnival_43.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/anthro_blog_carnival_43.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sixty-fifth &lt;a href="http://fourstonehearth.net/"&gt;Four Stone Hearth&lt;/a&gt; blog carnival is on-line at &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/four-stone-hearth-anthropology-blog-carnival-65/"&gt;A Primate of Modern Aspect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In May 2008 the island of Guam became a living laboratory for scientists as they attached acoustic equipment to coconut trees in order to listen for rhinoceros beetles.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers have discovered an important element for making night vision possible in nocturnal mammals: the DNA within the photoreceptor rod cells responsible for low light vision is packaged in a very unconventional way, according to a report in the April 17th issue of Cell. That special DNA architecture turns the rod cell nuclei themselves into tiny light-collecting lenses, with millions of them in every nocturnal eye.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Invasive species can disrupt natural and human-made ecosystems, throwing food webs out of balance and damaging the services they provide to people. Now scientists have begun to put a price tag on this damage. In a study published the week of April 20 in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment e-view, ecologists have listed the invasive species that cause the most harm to environment and cost the most money to control.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/ptech/04/14/twitter.study/"&gt;Scientists warn of Twitter dangers&lt;/a&gt;", said CNN  on 4/14/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Rapid-fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social-networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's "moral compass" to process and could harm young people's emotional development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSNBC asked "&lt;a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/04/14/1891640.aspx"&gt;Is Twitter Evil?&lt;/a&gt;". The Telegraph explained that "&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5149195/Twitter-and-Facebook-could-harm-moral-values-scientists-warn.html"&gt;Twitter and Facebook could harm moral values, scientists warn&lt;/a&gt;". Other headlines from 4/14/2009 include "&lt;a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/04/14/Twittering-rapid-media-may-confuse-morals/UPI-27341239737663/"&gt;Twittering, rapid media may confuse morals&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/living/article/621643"&gt;Does texting make U mean?&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Lifestyle/Hooked-to-facebook-Beware/articleshow/4400463.cms"&gt;Hooked to facebook?

&lt;p&gt;As usual when stuff that people like is shown to be bad for them, the public apparently discounted these dire warnings. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.marketingshift.com/2009/4/survey-results-most-dont-believe.cfm"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; reported at the Marketing Shift blog, when asked "Do social networks and rapid updates desensitize you to sad news?", 74% said "no", 13% said "maybe", and only 13% said "yes".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the public skepticism was a good thing, because the news reports were a load of hooey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The timing of streams of information did indeed cause some public immorality in this case — but the guilty party was not Twitter or Facebook or TV News, but rather  the National Academy of Sciences, in whose Proceedings  the cited reseach was published. In  accord with its usual practice, PNAS released the embargo for journalists a full week before the paper was available for other scientists and the general public to read. As a result, the news media could spread nonsense-pretending-to-be-science (almost) unchallenged for seven of those famous 24-hour news cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "nonsense" is far too mild a word for the way these stories described the research of Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, Andrea McColl, Hanna Damasio and Antonio Damasio, "&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/04/17/0810363106.abstract"&gt;Neural correlates of admiration and compassion&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, published online April 20, 2009.  I haven't seen such a spectacular divergence between evidence and science journalism since the infamous &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002493.html"&gt;"email and texting lower the IQ twice as much as smoking pot" case&lt;/a&gt; of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what the experimenters actually did, as described in their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In an fMRI experiment, participants were exposed to narratives based on true stories designed to evoke admiration and compassion in 4 distinct categories: admiration for virtue (AV), admiration for skill (AS), compassion for social/psychological pain (CSP), and compassion for physical pain (CPP). The goal was to test hypotheses about recruitment of homeostatic, somatosensory, and consciousness-related neural systems during the processing of pain-related (compassion) and non-pain-related (admiration) social emotions along 2 dimensions: emotions about other peoples' social/psychological conditions (AV, CSP) and emotions about others' physical conditions (AS, CPP). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic findings were nothing very new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Consistent with theoretical accounts, the experience of all 4 emotions engaged brain regions involved in interoceptive representation and homeostatic regulation, including anterior insula, anterior cingulate, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did find "a previously undescribed pattern within the posteromedial cortices (the ensemble of precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial region)" in which "emotions pertaining to social/psychological and physical situations engaged different networks aligned, respectively, with interoceptive and exteroceptive neural systems".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They told each of their 13 subjects (probably USC medical students) 60 stories, written and produced by the experimenters, "supplemented by combinations of audio/video/still images". One kind of story centered on "social pain", a second one involved "bodily injury without social consequences", a third featured "virtuous acts", and a fourth described "virtuosic skill without virtuous implications". You can read some sample stories &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2009/04/20/0810363106.DCSupplemental/0810363106SI.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects actually viewed the narratives in a preparatory session. Then while they were in the scanner, they "viewed short [five-second] reminder versions and were asked to think about the complete narrative that they had been told earlier, to become as emotional as possible, and to report the strength of their emotion via button press".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the goal of the experiment, as its title indicates, was to sort out the &amp;quot;neural correlates of admiration and compassion&amp;quot;. The reason for the five-second reminder versions was not to imitate Twitter, Facebook, and TV News, but to deal with the problem of how to fit their subjects&amp;#39; responses to 60 narratives — 12 in each of four categories — into a single fMRI session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that they expected to find, on the basis of common sense as well as some prior research, was that "the activity correlated with CPP ["Compassion for Physical Pain"] would peak earlier and extinguish more quickly than the other emotions". To test this hypothesis,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… we used double-gamma curve fitting to compare the ERA time courses of the BOLD effects associated with each of the conditions in the anterior insula (see Fig. 3). Duration was calculated from the width of the curves at half-height. […] CPP peaked more quickly than each of the other emotions and had a shorter duration (see Table S4 for details).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's their Figure 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/YangFig3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In interpreting such graphs, keep in mind that the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v23/n5/fig_tab/9591402f2.html#figure-title"&gt;hemodynamic impulse response&lt;/a&gt; to a single neural event takes 3-4 seconds to reach its peak, and 10-15 seconds to return to baseline.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's their Table S4,  slightly expanded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to peak (SE) [SD?]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration (SE) [SD?]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Admiration for Virtue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.81 (0.25) [3.12]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.79 (0.54) [6.74]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Admiration for Skill&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.60 (0.32) [4.0]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.76 (1.01) [12.61]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Compassion for Social Pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.73 (0.24) [3.0]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.89 (0.96) [11.99]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Compassion for Physical Pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.07 (0.46) [5.75]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.21 (0.58) [7.24]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the differences in average time course here are on the order of one to four seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t give us any estimates of effect size. So I&amp;#39;ve calculated the standard deviations, assuming that the standard errors they give were determined on the basis of 13 subjects times 12 narratives per category, for N=156. If this is correct, then the effect sizes for time to peak are  moderate to large-ish — the average time-to-peak difference between CSP and CPP was 1.66 seconds, d=0.36; the average difference between AS and CPP was 3.53 seconds, d=0.71). The effect sizes for duration are small to moderate (a mean difference between AS and and CPP of 0.55 seconds, d=0.05, and a mean difference between CSP and CPP of 4.68 seconds, d=0.47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, how did they test the way that Twitter and Facebook and TV News "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering"&lt;/span&gt;? Um, well, they didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so how do these interesting but frankly underwhelming results suggest that &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Using Facebook or Twitter may make you a bad person because it ruins your moral compass&lt;/span&gt;", as one news story put it? How did another reporter conclude from this research that "&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;the digital torrent of information from networking sites could have long-term damaging effects on the emotional development of young people's brains&lt;/span&gt;"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it all started with the press release by Carl Marziali, "&lt;a href="http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/nobler_instincts_take_time.html"&gt;Nobler Instincts Take Time&lt;/a&gt;", USC News, 4/14/2009. Here's how he spun the research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“For some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people’s social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and reflection,” said first author Mary Helen Immordino-Yang of the USC Rossier School of Education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Humans can sort information very quickly and can respond in fractions of seconds to signs of physical pain in others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Admiration and compassion - two of the social emotions that define humanity - take much longer, Damasio’s group found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Their study appeared online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“Damasio’s study has extraordinary implications for the human perception of events in a digital communication environment,” said USC Annenberg media scholar Manuel Castells, holder of the Wallis Annenberg Chair of Communication Technology and Society at USC. “Lasting compassion in relationship to psychological suffering requires a level of persistent, emotional attention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to joke that for Annenberg communications professors, "persistent emotional attention" apparently involves a time span of 1.66 seconds, the mean time-to-peak difference between insula activity in compassion for social pain and compassion for physical pain. A more realistic explanation is that Prof. Castells didn't bother to read the paper, or to learn anything at all about the underlying research, but just offered a useful sound bite in ritual response to a leading question from Carl Marziali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And similarly, I suspect that Marziali pestered &lt;a href="http://rossier.usc.edu/faculty/mary_helen_immordinoyang.html"&gt;Dr. Immordino-Yang&lt;/a&gt; until she gave him the quote that he needed to support the preposterous spin that he'd decided to put on this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t be sure about this, of course — it&amp;#39;s also possible that the scientists involved pimped their research to Mr. Marziali in a completely unethical way, and he naively accepted their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next key contributor to the process was the anonymous editor  who headlined Science Daily's reprint of Carl Marziali's press release as "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090413180703.htm"&gt;Rapid-fire Media May Confuse Your Moral Compass, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;". Again, I'll bet that no one at Science Daily even glanced at the PNAS paper, even if they were given access to it. In any case, at this point the stage was set for the epic paroxysm of poppycock that inevitably followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in this process comes out badly, in my opinion. Carl Marziali, who wrote the USC press release, should go back to selling real estate, or wherever he learned the ethics that he displayed in this case. Antonio Damasio, the senior researcher and last author of the cited study, was at best asleep at the switch — he surely knows that cognitive neuroscience &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004578.html"&gt;tends to make people tolerant of illogical reasoning&lt;/a&gt;, and it's shameful that he doesn't keep a more careful watch on the press releases coming out of his lab. The lead author, a junior researcher, was either naive about the ways of flacks and hacks, or complicit in pimping her study. The Annenberg professor, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells"&gt;Manuel Castells&lt;/a&gt;, should be ashamed of himself for stepping up on cue to supply a spurious Moral Lesson that had nothing whatever to do with the underlying research. (Please insert an extra 1.66 seconds at this point to allow your appreciation of social pain to develop fully, while reflecting on how Prof. Castells allowed himself to be presented as a pompous fraud.) The National Academy of Science once again abetted the public dissemination of pernicious nonsense by releasing a paper to journalists a week before making it available to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the world&amp;#39;s science writers, of course, swallowed the press release and regurgitated their own  fermented versions of it: &amp;quot;Twitter can make you mean&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Scientists from the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California believe heavy users of Twitter and Facebook could become &amp;#39;indifferent to human suffering&amp;#39;&amp;quot;,; &amp;quot;exposure to constant news bulletins … could harm young people&amp;#39;s brain development by not giving them enough time to process information about others&amp;#39; emotional pain [and] may also affect the ability to feel admiration for the good deeds of others&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Ben Goldacre, whose BS detector went off on cue, and who managed to get an early copy of the paper by some back-channel route ("&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/04/experts-say-new-scientific-evidence-helpfully-justifies-massive-pre-existing-moral-prejudice/"&gt;Experts say new scientific evidence helpfully justifies massive pre-existing moral prejudice&lt;/a&gt;", Bad Science, 4/18/2009), and to Chris Matyszczyk at CNET, who was suitably skeptical on the basis of common sense ("&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10219935-71.html"&gt;Oh, so now Twitter is making us immoral&lt;/a&gt;", 4/15/2009). Chris also wins Best Line: "Your brain might, at this point, be scanning the thought that if all the subjects of this research were from Los Angeles, it might be surprising that the scientists found any moral compass at all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And props to the 74% of respondents in that &lt;a href="http://www.marketingshift.com/2009/4/survey-results-most-dont-believe.cfm"&gt;internet survey&lt;/a&gt; who weren't persuaded by this fake-scientific morality play.  All the same, though, their skepticism underlines the collateral damage done by such garbage.  The media's usual motivation in cases of this type is to give pretend-scientific justification for "pre-existing moral prejudice", as Ben Goldacre observes. That's the hook for readers and viewers. But such stories also debase the coinage of rational inquiry taken as a whole, confirming the common prejudice that it's OK to act on any beliefs that take your fancy, since science is all meretricious bullshit anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240403896762"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=463">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb45276694b48c84</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">Pseudoscience In Medical News at the Huffington Post</title><published>2009-04-22T12:18:26Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T12:18:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=463" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many have pointed out, we are in the midst of a transformation in the way news is created, distributed, and monetized - all brought on by the internet. Access to information has dramatically increased, while the traditional news outlets are fading away. The new internet-based outlets that are cropping up are often hybrids that do not fit into any existing definition. Science-based medicine itself is such an outlet - it’s primarily a group professional blog, but we have editors and take submissions. We also plan to expand the type of resources available on SBM. We’re experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like Plos ONE, are experimenting with open-access peer-reviewed journals. And there are online newspapers that are part blog, part news feed, part something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are in this phase of experimentation it is important to monitor quality control, as the old institutions lose their grip on the flow of information. Health information in particular, now the most common type of information on the internet, suffers from poor quality control, leading the average consumer with too much information of too low quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, which bills itself as “The Internet Newspaper: News Blogs Video Community” is a hybrid news outlet. While it contains traditional news articles, as one would expect from any newspaper, it also has developed a reputation for publishing consistently anti-scientific blogs and articles, particularly in the area of medicine. Some of these articles would make a Weekly World News editor blush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From one point of view, these are just personal blogs, and therefore they are the opinions of an individual published without any filter. But they are packaged as part of something that calls itself a newspaper, and this raises the question of editorial responsibility. What is the responsibility of the Huffington Post when they publish gross health misinformation on their site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent posts illustrate the problem. But to first put them into context, the Huffington Post has long been a home to anti-vaccinationists such as David Kirby and RFK Jr. It has also been an outlet for Deepak Chopra to promote his unscientific medical claims. In fact it does not seem that the problem is a lack of a quality filter for health informtion, but that there is a specific editorial policy at the Huffington Post to promote anything that goes against the scientific medical mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antibiotics Cause Cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the single worst article I have ever read on the Huffington Post, which is saying something, is a recent article by Kim Evans in which she claims that &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-evans/antibiotics-cause-cancer_b_186968.html"&gt;antibiotics cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She starts off with some reasonable premises, that antibiotics are being over-used - a problem recognized by mainstream medicine, although she is sloppy in her use of terminology. For example, she refers to the normal friendly bacteria that colonize our bodies as “probiotics”. Actually, probiotics refers to products that include live bacteria that are meant to support the normal bacterial flora in our bodies - not the bacteria themselves. This is a small point, but reflects the intellectual laziness that Evans brought to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she launches into her ridiculous claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These healthy bacteria, which should be in abundance in our guts, dine on unhealthy bacteria and yeasts in our bodies, serving to keep these problems in check for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, these healthy bacteria form the basis of our immune system — or they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; until we took antibiotics because antibiotics regularly kill our healthy bacteria. And that can set you up for numerous problems down the road — including some very serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is factually wrong, and betrays a level of ignorance of basic human biology that should preclude Evans from writing about any medical topic. Healthy bacteria do not form the basis of our immune system. Specialized human tissue and cells form the basis of our immune system. Our skin also provides an important barrier and can be considered part of our immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy bacteria are not part of our immune system. It is true that they play a role resisting infection because they form a stable ecosystem of bacteria and they crowd out harmful bacteria or fungus. It is also true, however, that under physiological stress healthy bacteria can become infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, healthy bacteria do not “eat” other bacteria or fungus - again, their function is simply to crowd out infections organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While overuse of antibiotics is a problem because of the rise of resistant bacteria, antibiotic use has not altered the role healthy bacteria play for our digestion and resistance to infection. Most people still have healthy bacterial ecosystems. It is true that broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat serious infections can also kill off some of the healthy bacteria, and this can result in certain bacteria or funguses growing out of control and creating an infection. These infections can then be treated themselves, and the bacterial flora will eventually recover to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be a role for probiotics if taken early enough, but the effects are modest and symptomatic only. Probiotics do not restore a healthy bacterial ecosystem, and are not needed for maintenance. (Mark Crislip wrote an excellent review of this topic &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=344"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans then builds her case with this falsehood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, an estimated 90 percent of the population has a problem with candida overgrowth, although most don’t know it. And second, candida overgrowth can be the root cause of literally hundreds of different problems in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Candida does colonize about 90% of the population, but as part of the normal ecosystem. Most people do not have a problem with candida overgrowth. There is also no evidence that candida causes hundreds of health problems. This is a pseudoscientific claim that is not uncommon among sectarian practitioners. Candida overgrowth is a popular “fake” diagnosis that fits the common pattern - claims that it causes common non-specific symptoms and hundreds of real health problems, so that it can be diagnosed in anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While candida can cause real infections, it can be treated with antifungals and usually presents only an acute illness that can be cured. Some people do have problems with recurrent infections. But there is no evidence that chronic candidiasis is an epidemic or can cause many disparate conditions. This concept of candidiasis is used as a “theory of everything”, popular among medical pseudosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan then brings it home with this astounding claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also fascinating that an oncologist in Rome, Dr. Tullio Simoncini, says that &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6164831119169743164"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;cancer is a fungus and actually an advanced form of candida overgrowth. You can read more in his book,  &lt;em&gt;Cancer is a Fungus&lt;/em&gt;, in which he scientifically explains that the cause of cancer “is always and only candida.” Because Dr. Simoncini is having a great deal of success eliminating cancer in the body very quickly, I believe he’s one to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_fungus_among_us_in_oncology.php"&gt;Dr. Simoncini is a notorious cancer quack&lt;/a&gt; with bizarre claims that have not been demonstrated scientifically. In fact, they are demonstrably false. That is what Evans was leading us too with her sloppy journalism and medical falsehoods - the promotion of a typical cure for all cancers scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive Scanning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is Margaret Ruth who recently informed Huffington Post readers about medical intuitives.  She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as an X-ray machine scans a body in order to gain specific medical details, an intuitive scan works to provide an energetic portrait of the client. The premise is that the physical body has an energy blueprint and so the intuitive scan will look for energy blockages and areas of stress. Good health is, in general, considered to be clear flows of energy between all the chakras and easy, free functioning of all organs and body systems. Because this is an intuitive technique, scans can be done in person or from a distance with equal accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pure magical thinking.  A couple centuries of biological science has failed to either discover a human”energy blueprint” nor the need for any such hypothesis. The vitalists (those who believe in a life force) lost the scientific battle in the 19th century. No one who currently claims to be able to detect or manipulate vague human energy fields has been able to demonstrate that they can do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Ruth writes about medical intuitives as if they were as established as X-rays.  She doesn’t even try to achieve the “false balance” typical of the journalistic approach to controversial scientific topics. Most journalists at least know they should cover both sides of an issue. This becomes problematic when they balance an issue that is inherently asymetrical. For example, they may give equal weight to a lone crank as they do the the solid scientific consensus of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth is not even doing that - she writes as if there is no controversy at all, let alone that the scientific evidence is heavily against any notion of human energy fields or intuitive diagnosis. There is no attempt to put these claims into any scientific context - Ruth’s article is pure promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She follows with an interview of two nurses who claim to be medical intuitives  - without asking any inconvenient questions about science or evidence, of course. I am curious as to why Ruth only gave their first names, without any comment. This betrays a lack of transparency necessary to good journalism and good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans article was nothing more than a thinly veiled promotion of her book on “cleansing”, devoid of anything that can be considered journalism or even basic scientific knowledge. Ruth’s article was a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim. The readers of the Huffington Post were not well-served by either article. Readers were not given enough information to make an informed decision about the claims that were being promoted, nor even of the controversial status of the claims. They were also fed demonstrable medical falsehoods and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now what I expect from the Huffington Post, which is also one of the main outlets of the anti-vaccination movement. This fatally compromises the credibility of the Huffington Post in my opinion, and raises the bigger question of what we can expect from the new breed of online blog/news hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;

He begins his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/books/22elem.html"&gt;'The Elements of Style' turns 50&lt;/a&gt;" (April 21) thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does a professional writer discuss "The Elements of Style" without nervously looking over his shoulder and seeing Will Strunk and E. B. White (or thousands of readers of their book) second-guessing him? (Is "second-guessing" hyphenated or not? Is posing a question the same as using the passive voice?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is posing a question the same as using the passive voice?&lt;/strong&gt; Great Caesar's ghost, it is just as bad as I thought out there, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a professional writer, working for what is perhaps the world's most influential quality newspaper, worrying aloud about whether asking a rhetorical question is "the same" as the passive construction (because if it were, of course, the implication would be that it was bad in some inexplainable yet allegedly important way).  Yes, Roberts may be only half serious; but it is the fact that the thought came to him that I'm concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is nervous about grammar while clearly clueless about it.  I have seen this so often before.  Nervous cluelessness.  That is what Strunk and White have done to those of America's writers (overwhelmingly inexperienced college students, of course) who follow them.  The users of this book are less sure of themselves, yet no better informed, and their ability to write is probably being harmed rather than enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You people (you know who you are) who write to me cavilling about my being too critical of Strunk and White's little book, too harsh in my judgment of it: you're wrong, you know.  This is really a bad situation. Harm is being done to America's students and even professional writers every day this semicentenarian (actually nonagenarian) booklet of amateur grammar grumbling is out there in the bookshops and on people's desks. This isn't me being grouchy, Language Log readers; I'm really a very nice and happy guy.  But people's lives are being made worse out there by confusing and confused instructions about writing that give them vague unease instead of a sense of mastery, and I am concerned about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am right, and the defenders of The Little Book are wrong.  And I have not bothered to turn comments on for this post.  You know why?  Because I've decided that I just don't want to spend any of today being nibbled to death by ducks.&lt;/p&gt;

'Tis the season for IEPs (and the photo accompanying this post is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; meant to suggest that IEP meetings are like getting blood drawn.......read on......): A friend who's an advocate for parents just send me a link to &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/index.html"&gt;About Autism Law.com&lt;/a&gt; and (mindful of Charlie's IEP, which will be in May), I've been going through each section. Many of us are familiar with the numerous resources about special education law at &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/"&gt;Wrightslaw&lt;/a&gt; and subscribe to their newsletter, the Special Ed Advocate. &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/index.html"&gt;About Autism Law.com&lt;/a&gt; is written by a lawyer, Dave Sherman (and his book on &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QaM7zgRyR4UC&amp;amp;dq=Autism:+Your+Child&amp;#39;s+Right+to+Special+Education&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=55Gg1P0Xkk&amp;amp;sig=d2gQ2quMJwFJUx9nYqba67a6kI4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=zpjuSZ9d5JqUB7ChwCc&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=2"&gt;Autism: Asserting Your Child's Right to Special Education&lt;/a&gt; is featured on his website). The left sidebar is organized into subjects that often arise as a parent prepares for an IEP meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/full_article.html#1"&gt;Obtaining an Assessment for an Autistic Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/full_article.html#3"&gt;Autism Services&lt;/a&gt; (did you know your child might qualify for, besides speech and OT, physical therapy, medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes, and more?)&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/full_article.html#4"&gt;Writing a parent attachment to the IEP&lt;/a&gt; in which you state "your position, what you want, what you disagree with, and anything else that would be appropriate."&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/full_article.html#8"&gt;Stay Put&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/not_agree_with_iep_offered_by_school_district.html"&gt;What you should do if you don't agree with the IEP offered by your school district&lt;/a&gt; (which, alas, happens more often than one might wish)&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/transition_services_idea_2004.html"&gt;Transition Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/child_private_school_reimbursement_public_school.html"&gt;Placing your child in a private out-of-district placement&lt;/a&gt; and seeking reimbursement from the school district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader, Love is the Message, has also compiled a long list of resources about IEPs and more on this post, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/keep_it_at_the_local_level_school_placements"&gt;Keep It At the Local Level: School Placements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I feel that Charlie is (at long last) in an appropriate educational placement with a fabulous teacher; just hope for this to continue for another year (at least). My guiding thought for this IEP is the question, how can we ensure that Charlie is currently and will remain a member of the community, educated among his peers? What kinds of accommodations do the rest of us (included us, Charlie's parents, as well as the school staff) need to make to help Charlie----a child who would most likely not have been educated in a public school, or educated at all, even a short time ago----achieve this goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's academic assessments are full of long streams of "SP" and "NP"---"some progress and no progress. But one always has to be wary of judging him too much by what happened, or didn't happen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning Charlie had testing----blood testing---scheduled. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_amygdala_and_autism"&gt;new neurologist&lt;/a&gt; that we've taken him to had requested that Charlie have genetic testing done. I'll admit that I've been dragging my feet to pick up the phone and schedule the testing. The last time Charlie had blood drawn was when he was five and I held him in my lap while a technician tried and tried to draw blood from my writhing, forget-about-sitting-still, wailing child. The technician was only able to get about two-thirds of a vial and, me being in almost the same state as Charlie by that point, that was the last time that we ever tried that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday it went great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I teach at 9.30 am on Tuesday morning and the appointment was at 9am---early, so there wouldn't be a line and so Charlie would get something to eat as soon as the testing was done. (He had to do the test on an empty stomach.)  My parents and Jim took Charlie.  They had to wait 45 minutes while the office staff looked up the right codes for the tests; Charlie stood patiently and finally sat down and crossed his legs. After they went in to get the testing done, they had to wait for 15 more minutes before a technician appeared with a tray with a dozen empty vials and explained that they'd need to take that many to get all the tests the doctor had ordered done.  Jim supported Charlie's shoulders and my dad helped Charlie keep his arm still and it was all over in eight or so minutes, Charlie sitting quiet and still the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, they went out to a diner and Charlie turned down a new food (Taylor ham and egg on a bun---he wouldn't touch any of it, however much ketchup Jim poured on it) and went for the fries. (Well, of course.) Afterwards, they went on a bike ride during which Jim crossed a busy intersection at the light with Charlie behind him----only Charlie was still on the other side of the street and the light had turned red.

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend reading the whole article, but take for instance, this opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant thing about Simon Baron-Cohen’s recent New Scientist grouse about media irresponsibility and science (&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20127011.300-media-distortion-damages-both-science-and-journalism.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;) was that he did not mention the publication just a few days earlier in the Daily Mail of his latest – if long delayed – figure for the prevalence of autism in the UK school population of 1 in 60 (&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1163606/One-child-60-suffers-form-autism.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; ).  These figures had been hanging around unpublished 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is their lead-in to explaining how because the figures of the rate of autism in the UK aren’t cited too often that this is somehow further proof of the evil conspiracy to hide the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them, however, they’re complete idiots. Here’s my response to Age of Autism:  So let me get this straight. You’re admitting that despite &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule"&gt;the fact that the UK vaccine schedule for kids has over a dozen fewer vaccines than in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;. (24 in the U.S. to 11 in the UK by the age of 2), the rate of autism there is greater than in the U.S. (1 in 150) and yet you’re calling that a victory for your position that the greater number of vaccines leads to the greater rate of autism. Come again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s this little oddity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article led to a furore. The head of the industry lobby organisation, Science Media Centre, Fiona Fox (a former denier of the Rwandan holocaust &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,181819,00.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; ) led an institutional attack on the article which she herself documented in a blog post  ‘Why we need the best journalists on public stories’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tell me John, what exactly is “a former denier of the Rwandan holocaust” anyway? Isn’t that the same thing as a believer in the Rwandan holocaust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more thing. What the fuck does one’s beliefs about the Rwandan holocaust have to do with vaccines or autism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could get back to me on those questions, that’d be great. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

First, see &lt;a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/99135"&gt;americanchronicle.com&lt;/a&gt;. This account is just so packed with mis-statements, outright lies, and scientific howlers, it would take me all day to itemize them - but it can still do a lot of harm just because the ignorant reporter - Peter Fotis Kapnistos - has published the material. I suggest he may now want to return to his former calling in fashion and advertising photography, rather than continue to pose as a "journalist."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote him, he says, first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...it was alleged that Uri Geller was caught cheating in an Israeli TV documentary that has lately also circulated on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it was &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; that Geller was doing one of the &lt;em&gt;only five tricks he knows&lt;/em&gt;, and second, that was not any "TV documentary," at all.  It was simply a TV entertainment show. Kapnistos continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accusation was that a slow motion shot revealed him producing a small magnet from behind his ear or out of his hair to influence a compass needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anyone who might have said that, would not have been a magician, I'll tell you that. In any case, I've never seen such a statement, except &lt;em&gt;from Geller himself&lt;/em&gt; - because he knows that it's a ridiculous scenario, as I'll show you up ahead, one that can't be supported.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240374961108"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3023">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d75911c246e62761</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Logic/Philosophy"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="American Humanist Association"/><category term="atheists"/><category term="Gore Vidal"/><category term="Immanuel Kant"/><title type="html">Gore Vidal Named Honorary President of American Humanist Association</title><published>2009-04-22T04:35:10Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T04:35:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/gore-vidal-named-honorary-president-of-american-humanist-association/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2009-04-gore-vidal-accepts-title-of-american-humanist-association-honorary-president"&gt;Gore Vidal has been named &lt;/a&gt;Honorary President of the American Humanist Association.&lt;/p&gt;

He created us all in his image — probably a mistake — and then allows us to run wild and punishes us or rewards us with his beaming vision of himself. This is no god I really want to have any traffic with at all. I mean, the idea that good behavior only depends upon your fear of what will happen to you after you die, that you will be punished excludes all of philosophy. It excludes Plato, it excludes the mystery cults of Greece, it excludes the Roman idea of what is a good man. There goes Marcus Aurelius, there goes Epictetus, there go the stoics. These are all better thinkers than anything that the Christian church has come up with in 2,000 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This looks godawful. And that’s before considering the casting of Tom Arnold. Funny how this film about a paranormal investigator bares no resemblance whatsoever to anything real life leading paranormal investigator Joe Nickell has ever experienced when investigating an alleged haunted house. To learn how the reality differs from fiction, I recommend &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/joe_nickell_debunking_in_hollywood/"&gt;the interview Joe Nickell did for the Point of Inquiry podcast about how his profession is portrayed in Hollywood movies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But at least he &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; did one thing very few woos actually ever get around to doing, namely he admitted that Qi (and therefore the basis of Feng Shui) is just an assumption and a human construct.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By all means, read the whole comment thread.  I just want to highlight the end of the discussion, where we finally managed to pin Howard down.  It started with Howard making &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/03/feng-shui.html#comment-6a00d83451df0c69e201156f0c83fd970c"&gt;comment # 133&lt;/a&gt; and the comment after it, #134:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;FS is about how to take advantage of life enhancing forces (jue sheng qi) which science is a part. So it is part science by using it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We use things that have evidence and we use things that don&amp;#39;t have evidence, as long as it is useful, we use them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some parts of FS can be tested by science, like why the Chinese preferred a courtyard house, Some parts can&amp;#39;t, like the assumption we make that everything has qi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I asked him (comment #135) how he knew these things.  How did he know that life enhancing forces of &lt;em&gt;jue sheng qi&lt;/em&gt; even existed or what effect they have?  How did he know they were useful if we don’t have evidence for them as he admitted?  How did he know (as he claimed) everything has qi if (as he said), they can’t be tested?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His response in &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/03/feng-shui.html#comment-6a00d83451df0c69e201156f0e5097970c"&gt;comment 135&lt;/a&gt; was (with my bold):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qi is an assumption&lt;/strong&gt; and even science uses assumptions and in mathematics as well. An assumption is a proposition that is taken for granted, that is, &lt;strong&gt;as if&lt;/strong&gt; it were known to be true.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As if”?!  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are quantifiable qi like tianqi(weather) and qixi (breath), etc. The there are also &lt;strong&gt;unquantifiable qi like gua qi which is a human construct&lt;/strong&gt; but we still use them because it is a useful tool by experience, like art, philosophy and religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  Qi is just pretend.  It was made up by humans.  We just act &amp;quot;as if&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And remember, Howard is not just any new agey woo, angry that I don’t support his favorite piece of magic.  He has studied this extensively.  He is &lt;a href="http://www.arqitektur.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;part of a team that designs buildings&lt;/a&gt; using Feng Shui, he &lt;a href="http://howardchoy.wordpress.com/category/seminars-and-workshops/" rel="nofollow"&gt;teaches seminars and workshops&lt;/a&gt; in Feng Shui, he has a &lt;a href="http://howardchoy.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Feng Shui blog&lt;/a&gt;.  In short, he is &lt;a href="http://www.absolutelyfengshui.com/library/15-core-principles-of-feng-shui-2.php"&gt;an expert in Feng Shui&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Howard has written 4 books on Feng Shui and Qigong and numerous articles for various magazines and journals worldwide. He has worked as the principal consulting Feng Shui Architect on the capital upgrading of the Chinese Garden in Darling Harbour, after having successfully completed the Feng Shui urban renewal for Sydney’s Chinatown in 2001 for the Sydney Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is the best a real expert can do?  It’s all made up, a human construct, an assumption?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then this evening, after two weeks of silence, Howard came back and left a final &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/03/feng-shui.html?cid=6a00d83451df0c69e201156f42fb09970c#comment-6a00d83451df0c69e201156f42fb09970c"&gt;&amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot; comment&lt;/a&gt; #163. Apparently “Feng Shui is not working here” and it’s all our fault for not 
just believing in Howard’s drivel. But real science doesn&amp;#39;t care whether you believe in it or not - it works regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an expert in Feng Shui, Howard is like the expert on fairies at the bottom of the garden - in both cases, the expertise is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240370056489"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/help_a_bunch_of_quitters.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8dfbfc0a2d4f639b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">Help a bunch of quitters.</title><published>2009-04-22T01:24:54Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T01:24:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/KuDLpVy75H4/help_a_bunch_of_quitters.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/help_a_bunch_of_quitters.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Noted ScienceBlogs commenter DuWayne Brayton has started a &lt;a href="http://quitterstobacco.blogspot.com/"&gt;new blog&lt;/a&gt; to aid in kicking an old habit.  In his &lt;a href="http://quitterstobacco.blogspot.com/2009/04/welcome.html"&gt;welcome post&lt;/a&gt;, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'm a soon to be ex-smoker. My name is DuWayne Brayton and I have been smoking for about &lt;a href="http://debrayton.blogspot.com/2009/04/in-which-duwayne-discusses-quitting.html"&gt;sixteen years now&lt;/a&gt;. I've had enough - though embarrassingly, it has taken the price of tobacco doubling, for me to decide to quit. I will move some of my other posts on smoking over, from my regular blog, but first, I am hoping to hear from you. I would really like to get some other smokers - current and ex, to post their stories.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have never had a tobacco addiction myself, I've been close to a number of people who have, so I know that quitting can be a challenge.  But I also know that it can be done.  (Case in point: my father quit smoking, after 13 years with cigarettes, shortly after I was born.  At least part of his motivation was what cigarettes took out of the household budget.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're looking to end a relationship with tobacco, or if you've done so already and want to share words of encouragement, &lt;a href="http://quitterstobacco.blogspot.com/"&gt;head on over&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a safe bet that DuWayne will keep you entertained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/help_a_bunch_of_quitters.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/KuDLpVy75H4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240366552257"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/support_the_ucla_pro-test_tomo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/125bd6a2dc32ddd0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Animal Rights"/><title type="html">Support the UCLA Pro-Test tomorrow and get educated about the use of animals in research</title><published>2009-04-22T03:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-04-22T03:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/aUTcYWJsgq8/support_the_ucla_pro-test_tomo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/support_the_ucla_pro-test_tomo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ucla-pro-test.org/" title=""&gt;UCLA Pro-Test&lt;/a&gt; is tomorrow. If you live there - go. If not, prepare yourself for inevitable discussions - online and offline - by getting informed. And my fellow science bloggers have certainly provided plenty of food for thought on the issue of use of animals in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you have to read &lt;b&gt;Janet Stemwedel's&lt;/b&gt; ongoing series (5 parts so far, but more are coming) about the potential for dialogue between the two (or more) sides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about.php" title=""&gt;Impediments to dialogue about animal research (part 1).&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, maybe it's the case that everyone who cares at all has staked out a position on the use of animals in scientific research and has no intentions of budging from it. But in the event that there still exists a handful of people who are thinking the issues through, or are interested in understanding the perspectives of those who hold different views about research with animals -- in the event that there are still people who would like to have a dialogue -- we need to understand what the impediments to this dialogue are and find ways to work around them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_1.php" title=""&gt;Impediments to dialogue about animal research (part 2).&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research with animals seems to be a topic of discussion especially well-suited to shouting matches and disengagement. Understanding the reasons this is so might clear a path to make dialogue possible. Yesterday, we discussed problems that arise when people in a discussion start with the assumption that the other guy is arguing in bad faith. If we can get past this presumptive mistrust of the other parties in the discussion, another significant impediment rears its head pretty quickly: Substantial disagreement about the facts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_2.php" title=""&gt;Impediments to dialogue about animal research (part 3).&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As with yesterday's dialogue blocker (the question of whether animal research is necessary for scientific and medical advancement), today's impediment is another substantial disagreement about the facts. A productive dialogue requires some kind of common ground between its participants, including some shared premises about the current state of affairs. One feature of the current state of affairs is the set of laws and regulations that cover animal use -- but these laws and regulations are a regular source of disagreement: Current animal welfare regulations are not restrictive enough/are too restrictive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_3.php" title=""&gt;Impediments to dialogue about animal research (part 4).&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we continue our look at ways that attempted dialogues about the use of animals in research run off the rails, let's take up one more kind of substantial disagreement about the facts. Today's featured impediment: Disagreement about whether animals used in research experience discomfort, distress, pain, or torture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/impediments_to_dialogue_about_4.php" title=""&gt;Impediments to dialogue about animal research (part 5).&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today we discuss an impediment to dialogue about animals in research that seems to have a special power to get people talking past each other rather than actually engaging with each other: Imprecision about the positions being staked out. Specifically, here, the issue is whether the people trying to have a dialogue are being precise in laying out the relevant philosophical positions about animals -- the position they hold, the position they're arguing against, the other positions that might be viable options.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also check Janet's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/research_with_animals/" title=""&gt;older posts&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark C. Chu-Carroll:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/04/can_simulations_replace_animal.php" title=""&gt;Can simulations replace animal testing? Alas, no.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; I don't want to get into a long discussion of the ethics of it here; that's a discussion which has been had hundreds of times in plenty of other places, and there's really no sense repeating it yet again. But there is one thing I can contribute to this discussion. One of the constant refrains of animal-rights protesters arguing against animal testing is: "Animal testing isn't necessary. We can use computer simulations instead."

&lt;p&gt;As a computer scientist who's spent some time studying simulation, I feel qualified to comment on that aspect of this argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest answer to that is the old programmers mantra: "Garbage in, Garbage out".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a tad more precise, like any other computer program, a simulation can only do what you tell it to. If you don't already know how something works, you can't simulate it. If you think you know how something works but you made a tiny, miniscule error, then the simulation can diverge dramatically from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we are in the midst of a traditional week-o-ARA-wackaloonery and two days away from the first US Pro-Test rally (at UCLA) this is all highly topical. Why not take some time to do a little bit of reading and thinking about these issues?

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the thornier problems in thinking about the justification of using animals is when two or more laudable goals call for opposing solutions. For today's edition of virtual IACUC we will consider what to do when Refinement calls for the use of more animals, in obvious conflict with Reduction. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The important thing is the setting of priority. These acts, like the March 2009 bombing of neuroscientist J. David Jentsch's car, are fundamental crimes against our rule of law as well as being a specific attack on scientific progress and the development of life-saving medical advances. With this announcement, and all of the publicity and news surrounding the UCLA Pro-Test rally in support of animal research scheduled for tomorrow...well, at the very least the wind has been taken out of the ARA sails during one of their big PR weeks. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As students and scientists at UCLA stand up to support lifesaving medical research, researchers at other institutions are offering their support for the cause. From Wake Forest University to the University of Arizona, from UC Davis to the University of South Dakota, researchers from across the United States have been united in their support for UCLA Pro-Test.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, researchers at UCLA have become a major target of animal rights extremists over the last few years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important that everyone know that all animals used in federally-funded research, are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure they are used in the smallest numbers possible and with the greatest commitment to their comfort and welfare. The search for cures for devastating diseases depends on cumulative evidence gained from quality research. The appropriate use of animals in medical research has enabled the development of successful therapies and preventive measures for a wide- range of human diseases such as polio, Parkinson's disease, and hepatitis A and B. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005215" title=""&gt;Rare Species Are Valued Big Time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has recently been postulated that the value humans place on rarity could cause the extinction of rare species. This is because people are willing to pay the high costs of exploiting the last individuals. Many hobbies, such as ecotourism or the keeping of exotic pets may cause this effect - known as the anthropogenic Allee effect. However, the entire theory relies on the insofar undemonstrated assumption that people do value rarity. In order to quantify how much people valued rare species relative to common ones, we created online slideshows of photographs of either rare or common species on an Internet web site. The slideshow with photographs of rare species attracted more visitors, and visitors spent, in general, more time waiting to view it. We provide evidence that people value rare more than common species. As we did not target consumers of a specific market, this finding suggests that the anthropogenic Allee effect is likely be driven by a large part of the population. Given the substantial participation in our online experiment, we highlight the potential of the world wide web resource as a tool for conservation action. However, the evidence presented here that the general public value rare species, combined with the assumption that anthropogenic Allee effect is operating, implies that conservationists should be prudent when using rarity to promote conservation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005217" title=""&gt;Consequences of the Timing of Menarche on Female Adolescent Sleep Phase Preference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most parents experience their children's puberty as a dramatic change in family life. This is not surprising considering the dynamics of physical and psychosocial maturation which occur during adolescence. A reasonable question, particularly from the parents' perspective, is: when does this vibrant episode end and adulthood finally start? The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between puberty and the changes in sleep phase preferences during female maturation and adulthood by a cross-sectional survey. The results from 1'187 females aged 5 to 51 years based on self-report measures of sleep preferences on weekdays and on free days as well as the occurrence of menarche, show that in contrast to prepubertal children, adolescent females exhibit a striking progression in delaying their sleep phase preference until 5 years after menarche. Thereafter, the sleep phase preference switches to advancing. The current study provides evidence that a clear shift in sleep-wake cycles temporally linked to menarche heralds the beginning of "adult-like" sleep-wake behaviour in women and can be used as a (chrono)biological marker for the onset of adulthood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005235" title=""&gt;Perturbing Dynamin Reveals Potent Effects on the Drosophila Circadian Clock&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transcriptional feedback loops are central to circadian clock function. However, the role of neural activity and membrane events in molecular rhythms in the fruit fly Drosophila is unclear. To address this question, we expressed a temperature-sensitive, dominant negative allele of the fly homolog of dynamin called shibirets1 (shits1), an active component in membrane vesicle scission. Broad expression in clock cells resulted in unexpectedly long, robust periods (&amp;gt;28 hours) comparable to perturbation of core clock components, suggesting an unappreciated role of membrane dynamics in setting period. Expression in the pacemaker lateral ventral neurons (LNv) was necessary and sufficient for this effect. Manipulation of other endocytic components exacerbated shits1&amp;#39;s behavioral effects, suggesting its mechanism is specific to endocytic regulation. PKA overexpression rescued period effects suggesting shits1 may downregulate PKA pathways. Levels of the clock component PERIOD were reduced in the shits1-expressing pacemaker small LNv of flies held at a fully restrictive temperature (29°C). Less restrictive conditions (25°C) delayed cycling proportional to observed behavioral changes. Levels of the neuropeptide PIGMENT-DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF), the only known LNv neurotransmitter, were also reduced, but PERIOD cycling was still delayed in flies lacking PDF, implicating a PDF-independent process. Further, shits1 expression in the eye also results in reduced PER protein and per and vri transcript levels, suggesting that shibire-dependent signaling extends to peripheral clocks. The level of nuclear CLK, transcriptional activator of many core clock genes, is also reduced in shits1 flies, and Clk overexpression suppresses the period-altering effects of shits1. We propose that membrane protein turnover through endocytic regulation of PKA pathways modulates the core clock by altering CLK levels and/or activity. These results suggest an important role for membrane scission in setting circadian period.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005236" title=""&gt;Genetic Structures of Copy Number Variants Revealed by Genotyping Single Sperm&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Copy number variants (CNVs) occupy a significant portion of the human genome and may have important roles in meiotic recombination, human genome evolution and gene expression. Many genetic diseases may be underlain by CNVs. However, because of the presence of their multiple copies, variability in copy numbers and the diploidy of the human genome, detailed genetic structure of CNVs cannot be readily studied by available techniques. Single sperm samples were used as the primary subjects for the study so that CNV haplotypes in the sperm donors could be studied individually. Forty-eight CNVs characterized in a previous study were analyzed using a microarray-based high-throughput genotyping method after multiplex amplification. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also included as controls. Two single-base variants, either allelic or paralogous, could be discriminated for all markers. Microarray data were used to resolve SNP alleles and CNV haplotypes, to quantitatively assess the numbers and compositions of the paralogous segments in each CNV haplotype. This is the first study of the genetic structure of CNVs on a large scale. Resulting information may help understand evolution of the human genome, gain insight into many genetic processes, and discriminate between CNVs and SNPs. The highly sensitive high-throughput experimental system with haploid sperm samples as subjects may be used to facilitate detailed large-scale CNV analysis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005239" title=""&gt;Doom and Boom on a Resilient Reef: Climate Change, Algal Overgrowth and Coral Recovery&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coral reefs around the world are experiencing large-scale degradation, largely due to global climate change, overfishing, diseases and eutrophication. Climate change models suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching events, with consequent increases in coral mortality and algal overgrowth. Critically, the recovery of damaged reefs will depend on the reversibility of seaweed blooms, generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed, and replenishment of corals by larvae that successfully recruit to damaged reefs. These processes usually take years to decades to bring a reef back to coral dominance. In 2006, mass bleaching of corals on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality. Here we show that this coral mortality was followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single species of unpalatable seaweed (Lobophora variegata), colonizing dead coral skeletons, but that corals on these reefs recovered dramatically, in less than a year. Unexpectedly, this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of corals by recruitment of coral larvae, as often assumed, but depended on several ecological mechanisms previously underestimated. These mechanisms of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rates of remnant coral tissue, very high competitive ability of the corals allowing them to out-compete the seaweed, a natural seasonal decline in the particular species of dominant seaweed, and an effective marine protected area system. Our study provides a key example of the doom and boom of a highly resilient reef, and new insights into the variability and mechanisms of reef resilience under rapid climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005253" title=""&gt;The Ordered Extension of Pseudopodia by Amoeboid Cells in the Absence of External Cues&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eukaryotic cells extend pseudopodia for movement. In the absence of external cues, cells move in random directions, but with a strong element of persistence that keeps them moving in the same direction Persistence allows cells to disperse over larger areas and is instrumental to enter new environments where spatial cues can lead the cell. Here we explore cell movement by analyzing the direction, size and timing of ~2000 pseudopodia that are extended by Dictyostelium cells. The results show that pseudpopod are extended perpendicular to the surface curvature at the place where they emerge. The location of new pseudopods is not random but highly ordered. Two types of pseudopodia may be formed: frequent splitting of an existing pseudopod, or the occasional extension of a de novo pseudopod at regions devoid of recent pseudopod activity. Split-pseudopodia are extended at ~60 degrees relative to the previous pseudopod, mostly as alternating Right/Left/Right steps leading to relatively straight zigzag runs. De novo pseudopodia are extended in nearly random directions thereby interrupting the zigzag runs. Persistence of cell movement is based on the ratio of split versus de novo pseudopodia. We identify PLA2 and cGMP signaling pathways that modulate this ratio of splitting and de novo pseudopodia, and thereby regulate the dispersal of cells. The observed ordered extension of pseudopodia in the absence of external cues provides a fundamental insight into the coordinated movement of cells, and might form the basis for movement that is directed by internal or external cues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005256" title=""&gt;Auditory-Visual Object Recognition Time Suggests Specific Processing for Animal Sounds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognizing an object requires binding together several cues, which may be distributed across different sensory modalities, and ignoring competing information originating from other objects. In addition, knowledge of the semantic category of an object is fundamental to determine how we should react to it. Here we investigate the role of semantic categories in the processing of auditory-visual objects. We used an auditory-visual object-recognition task (go/no-go paradigm). We compared recognition times for two categories: a biologically relevant one (animals) and a non-biologically relevant one (means of transport). Participants were asked to react as fast as possible to target objects, presented in the visual and/or the auditory modality, and to withhold their response for distractor objects. A first main finding was that, when participants were presented with unimodal or bimodal congruent stimuli (an image and a sound from the same object), similar reaction times were observed for all object categories. Thus, there was no advantage in the speed of recognition for biologically relevant compared to non-biologically relevant objects. A second finding was that, in the presence of a biologically relevant auditory distractor, the processing of a target object was slowed down, whether or not it was itself biologically relevant. It seems impossible to effectively ignore an animal sound, even when it is irrelevant to the task. These results suggest a specific and mandatory processing of animal sounds, possibly due to phylogenetic memory and consistent with the idea that hearing is particularly efficient as an alerting sense. They also highlight the importance of taking into account the auditory modality when investigating the way object concepts of biologically relevant categories are stored and retrieved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005261" title=""&gt;Assessing Biofuel Crop Invasiveness: A Case Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is widespread interest in biofuel crops as a solution to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual, relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting continues to be largely unregulated. Using a widely accepted weed risk assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate. Because of climatic and ecological similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are applicable to other vulnerable island and subtropical ecosystems worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures, such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks, which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting policies and adoption of the "polluter-pays" principle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005291" title=""&gt;Consumers Control Diversity and Functioning of a Natural Marine Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our understanding of the functional consequences of changes in biodiversity has been hampered by several limitations of previous work, including limited attention to trophic interactions, a focus on species richness rather than evenness, and the use of artificially assembled communities. In this study, we manipulated the density of an herbivorous snail in natural tide pools and allowed seaweed communities to assemble in an ecologically relevant and non-random manner. Seaweed species evenness and biomass-specific primary productivity (mg O2 h−1 g−1) were higher in tide pools with snails because snails preferentially consumed an otherwise dominant seaweed species that can reduce biomass-specific productivity rates of algal assemblages. Although snails reduced overall seaweed biomass in tide pools, they did not affect gross primary productivity at the scale of tide pools (mg O2 h−1 pool−1 or mg O2 h−1 m−2) because of the enhanced biomass-specific productivity associated with grazer-mediated increases in algal evenness. Our results suggest that increased attention to trophic interactions, diversity measures other than richness, and particularly the effects of consumers on evenness and primary productivity, will improve our understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and allow more effective links between experimental results and real-world changes in biodiversity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/10/fifty_years_after_sputnik.php"&gt;I've mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; that I grew up in a family that was fairly captivated by the U.S. space program, especially the Apollo program that brought humans to the Moon.  But as impressive as those manned missions to the Moon were, what did the Apollo program accomplish?  Where are our moon-bases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.orphansofapollo.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Orphans of Apollo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary film by Michael Potter, explores what one group of space exploration enthusiasts did when NASA's commitment to the space age seemed to falter.  By the mid-1970s, the Apollo program that put Americans on the moon was done, with two planned Apollo missions cancelled.  The U.S. had beaten the U.S.S.R. to the moon and brought back some moon rocks for study but what, really, had been accomplished?  Had the moon landings left a lasting impact on human culture that was more than superficial?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact was anything but superficial on a generation of kids whose imagination was captured by the Apollo program.  As these kids grew up, dreaming of a human future in space, NASA's visions and priorities shifted.  This generation that assumed space travel and exploration almost as an American birthright felt orphaned by the American space agency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as &lt;i&gt;Orphans of Apollo&lt;/i&gt; tells it, a group of them found each other and started figuring out how to get a foothold in space.  If NASA couldn't establish colonies on the moon or manned space stations, maybe the private sector could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/movie_review_orphans_of_apollo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/movie_review_orphans_of_apollo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/e5kUCi2CAUc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240354917712"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_361.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd8b0b4fad9a8050</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-04-21T23:50:44Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T23:50:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/kGd6VlfEwZU/todays_carnivals_361.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_361.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientia Pro Publica #2 is up on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/04/scientia_pro_publica_2.php" title=""&gt;Living the Scientific Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I can't pass up a posting on the article &lt;a href="http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090418/NEWS01/904180307/1001/NEWS"&gt;Students with autism can do well in college&lt;/a&gt; from Fort Wayne (IN).  Especially where as it makes a point I stress repeatedly in my presentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the American Disabilities Act of 1973 [ed. the ADA and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are two separate policies; there is no "ADA of 1973"] provides for certain educational accommodations for high school students with disabilities (extra time for tests, help with notes), the scenario changes slightly for college students with autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Eric J. Wagenfeld, director of the Office for Services for Students with Disabilities at IPFW, agrees communication is the key to success for a student with special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A student must provide me with documentation about his or her disability," he said. "Then I'll conduct an interview to determine what services that student needs. It may be extra test time, having tests read to them, taking an exam in a room without distractions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the scenario changes so that the responsibility for seeking accommodations is on the student.  So it's critical that a student be given the &lt;a href="http://www.ncwd-youth.info/resources_&amp;amp;_Publications/411.html"&gt;information&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.going-to-college.org/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;, and full support needed to advocate for their needs successfully.  This includes selecting a supportive university--something which sounds from &lt;a href="http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090418/NEWS01/904180307/1001/NEWS"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; like Huntington does a good deal better than my university--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICR claims it “met or exceeded” the 21 Standards of Certificates of Authority. In fact, ICR did not meet several of those standards which was the basis of the THECB’s refusal to grant the Certificate of Authority. Three of those unmet standards were faculty qualifications, the curriculum, and academic freedom of the faculty and students. The standard of judging these things is comparison with other Texas institutions of higher learning that offer the same Master of Science Degree in Science Education. ICR was in no way comparable to other institutions, which was the original THECB justification for denial of the certification. Indeed, ICR compares so unfavorably that in my opinion it would never be able to achieve accreditation from a legitimate accrediting association, and I believe ICR’s plan was to keep renewing its state Certificate of Authority indefinitely (or seek legislative assistance in some fashion.…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICR’s claim that it suffers from “anti-accommodational evolution-only-science enforcement policy practices” is frankly absurd. ICR has every right in the world to teach its Creationist pseudoscience to paying students and can continue to do that, so that falsifies its claim of illegal victimization by the State of Texas. It has no right, however, to demand that its graduating students be awarded a Texas-certified Master of Science degree, since under no definition of science or practice of legitimate science education in the United States is ICR’s curriculum “science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2009/Shindell_Faluvegi.html"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; “Climate response to regional radiative forcing during the twentieth century”, has generated some interesting discussion (some of it very 'interesting' indeed). So this post is an attempt to give a better context to the methods and implications of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some history. Global model responses to aerosols have been looked at since the early 1990s (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v369/n6483/abs/369734a0.html"&gt;Taylor and Penner, 1994&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;issn=1520-0442&amp;amp;volume=008&amp;amp;issue=10&amp;amp;page=2364"&gt;Mitchell et al, 1995&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wiki.nsdl.org/index.php/PALE:ClassicArticles/GlobalWarming/Article20"&gt;Santer et al, 1995&lt;/a&gt;). These studies and subsequent ones have shown that when a forcing is spatially concentrated, the regional climate response does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; closely follow the spatial pattern of the forcing. These two figures show an example of that from two recent models (GISS ModelE and GFDL). Despite extremely large localized forcings over the industrialized areas, the climate response is spread out much more broadly in the zonal direction. Similarly, although forcing is extremely large over India and Southeast Asia, those areas show only very weak warming. In particular, the Arctic climate response can be quite different from what the local forcing would imply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/shindell1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/shindell1.jpg" width="60%" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 1. Ensemble mean annual average 1880–2003 radiative forcing (Fs, the top-of-the-atmosphere forcing with fixed SSTs and sea-ice, left column) and the surface air temperature (SAT) response (ºC, local linear trends, right column) from 5-member ensemble simulations driven by tropospheric aerosols including their direct radiative effect only (top row) and both their direct and indirect (via cloud cover) effects (bottom row). [&lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2007/Shindell_etal.html"&gt;Shindell et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/shindell2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/shindell2.jpg" width="40%" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 2. Annual mean-adjusted radiative forcing (W/m2) between years 2100 and 2000 from tropospheric aerosols and ozone changes simulated under an A1B scenario (top) and annual surface air temperature change (°K) from the 2000s (years 2001–2010) to the 2090s (years 2091–2100) due to those same short-lived species in the GFDL model [&lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2007JD009176.shtml"&gt;Levy et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our paper, we wanted to characterize the geographic forcing/response relationship more clearly. Prior studies had looked at particular scenarios or time periods when forcings were typically changing over much of the world (albeit most strongly in certain regions). So we put idealized forcings from GHGs, aerosols, and ozone in the tropics, mid-latitudes and polar regions to see what would happen. The results showed that the temperature response in the tropics, like the global mean, is only mildly sensitive to the location of forcing. That is, you get an enhanced tropical response to forcing in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics (where you can activate strong positive feedbacks like snow/ice albedo), but the enhancement is only 40-50% over that found with forcings applied elsewhere. In contrast, the extratropical zones are much, much more sensitive to local radiative forcing than to tropical forcing or to forcing in the opposite hemisphere. So to quote from the paper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"global and tropical mean temperature trends during the twentieth century would have been quite similar if short-lived-species radiative forcing had been distributed homogeneously rather than being concentrated in the northern extratropics. Regional concentration of forcing contributed to the departures of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude and Arctic temperature trends from the global or Southern Hemisphere extratopical means, however."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then used the regional forcing/response relationships to derive the aerosol forcing needed to explain the observed global and regional temperature trends. Our results have a substantial uncertainty range which arises primarily from the influence of unforced, internal variability. The global mean preindustrial to present-day aerosol forcing we calculate is -1.31 +- 0.52 W/m2, consistent with the IPCC AR4 range of -0.6 to -2.4 W/m2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also estimated aerosol forcing for the tropics and Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes for several time periods, and compared with historical emissions estimates to tie the forcings to sulfate or black carbon (BC) aerosols when possible. The results show, for example, that nearly all CMIP3 models require strong aerosol cooling at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes during the 1931-1975 period to capture both the global mean trends and the NH mid-latitude versus Southern Hemisphere extratropics temperature trends (many CMIP3 models had both sulfate and BC, but not necessarily the correct amounts as modeling their forcing directly is quite uncertain, hence we compared the CMIP3 models' responses to non-aerosol forcings with observations to see how well they could do without aerosols). During the last 3 decades (1976-2007), the best fit to the temperature responses in the models require negative forcing from tropical aerosols but positive forcing from Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude aerosols. It's the latter, the positive Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude aerosol forcing that leads to the strong warming impact on the Arctic as well, as the Arctic responds to mid-latitude and local forcing, but the local forcing is primarily driven by mid-latitude emissions that are transported to the Arctic, so the overall climate response ends up being closely tied to Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude emissions. Given the strong sensitivity of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical zones to aerosol forcing, it's then understandable that those areas could have cooled during the mid 20th century when the aerosol forcing we calculate was substantially larger than greenhouse gas forcing (in absolute magnitude).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big uncertainty is still the influence of unforced internal variability, which we estimated from coupled ocean-atmosphere climate runs. Though that contribution is large, it was still not large enough to account for many of the mid-latitude and Arctic temperature trends without including aerosol forcing. For many cases, the influence of aerosols and internal variability were comparable in size. Though the influence of internal variability leads to a substantial uncertainty range in our results, they are nonetheless useful as other techniques of estimating aerosol forcing of climate have comparably large or larger uncertainties. These include ‘forward’ modeling from emissions to concentration to optical properties (e.g. see [&lt;a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/6/5225/2006/acp-6-5225-2006.html"&gt;Schulz et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;]), and various estimates based at least in part on satellite observations (see &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/02/an-aerosol-tour-de-forcing/"&gt;this previous post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting conclusions of the study include those relating to the Arctic. For example, we estimate that black carbon contributed 0.9 +/- 0.5ºC to 1890-2007 Arctic warming (which has been 1.9ºC total), making BC potentially a very large fraction of the overall warming there. We also estimated that aerosols in total contributed 1.1 +/- 0.8ºC to the 1976-2007 Arctic warming. This latter aerosol contribution to Arctic warming results from both increasing BC and decreasing sulfate, and as both were happening at once their contributions cannot be easily separated (unlike several earlier time periods we analyzed, when one increased while the other remained fairly constant). Though the uncertainty ranges are quite large, it can be useful to remember that the 95% confidence level conventionally used by scientists is not the only criteria that may be of interest. As the total observed Arctic warming during 1976-2007 was 1.5 +/- 0.3ºC, our results can be portrayed in many ways: there is about a 95% chance that aerosols contributed at least 15% to net Arctic warming over the past 3 decades, there is a 50% chance that they contributed about 70% or more, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth considering how to interpret the effects of decreasing sulfate during the past 3 decades. To try to make sure that the complex role of aerosols wouldn't be misunderstood, when referring to the recent warming due to aerosols at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and in the Arctic, we stated in the conclusions of the paper: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"much of this warming may stem from the unintended consequences of clean-air policies that have greatly decreased sulfate precursor emissions from North America and Europe (reducing the sulfate masking of greenhouse warming) and from large increases in Asian black carbon emissions."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is incorrect, or at least quite incomplete, to say that that controls on air pollution such as those created under the Clean Air Act in the US have caused the recent warming. In the absence of increasing greenhouse gases, our large historical emissions of sulfate precursors would have led to substantial cooling from sulfate, and the subsequent reduction in emissions would have brought temperatures back towards their previous level. So reduced sulfate does not cause warming in an absolute sense, only relative warming compared to a time when emissions were larger. Over the mid-20th century, sulfate precursor emissions appear to have been so large that they more then compensated for greenhouse gases, leading to a slight cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. During the last 3 decades, the reduction in sulfate has reversed that cooling, and allowed the effects of greenhouse gases to clearly show. In addition, black carbon aerosols lead to warming, and these have increased during the last 3 decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an analogy, picture a reservoir. Say that around the 1930s, rainfall into the watershed supplying the reservoir began to increase. However, around the same time, a leak developed in the dam. The lake level stayed fairly constant as the rainfall increased at about the same rate the leak grew over the next few decades. Finally, the leak was patched (in the early 70s). Over the next few decades, the lake level increased rapidly. Now, what’s the cause of that increase? Is it fair to say that lake level went up because the leak was fixed? Remember that if the rainfall hadn’t been steadily increasing, then the leak would have led to a drop in lake levels whereas fixing it would have brought the levels back to normal. However, it’s also incomplete to ignore the leak, because then it seems puzzling that the lake levels were flat despite the increased rain during the first few decades and that, were you to compare the increased rain with the lake level rise, you’d find the rise was more rapid during the past three decades than you could explain by the rain changes during that period. You need both factors to understand what happened, as you need both greenhouse gases and aerosols to explain the surface temperature observations (and the situation is more complex than this simple analogy due to the presence of both cooling and warming types of aerosols).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the implication should not be that cleaning up the air causes warming, but that air pollution plays a substantial role in climate, and we can better understand regional climate changes during the past by taking this into account. Economists have argued that inclusion of a broader array of climate forcing agents leads to more cost-effective strategies to mitigate climate change (e.g. [&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x0vq74h32p607782/"&gt;O'Neill, 2003&lt;/a&gt;]), so that taking into account the large impact of air pollution and its ancillary effects on human and ecosystem health may also lead to better solutions for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania spends spends about &lt;em&gt;$185 million&lt;/em&gt; each year on medical-assistance programs for children on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same state now has a $&lt;em&gt;20 million&lt;/em&gt; waiver to provide respite care, supported employment and other therapies for people older than 21 on the autism spectrum. Gov. Ed Rendell signed the waiver into law just last year; the program is administered by Pennsylvania's &lt;a href="http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/ServicesPrograms/Autism/AutismInitiatives/"&gt;Bureau of Autism Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something of an imbalance? Especially in light of the reality that (like all of us......) individuals on the autism spectrum are going to be adults for far longer than they are children. Has parents' fear of their children growing up and becoming adults with autism focused attention too much on doing "everything one can" to "remediate" autism in a child, rather than on thinking about the life-long needs of a child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not critiquing "early intervention"; certainly my own son benefited hugely from the teaching and care he received from the time he was 2 years old. But I hope we can find ways to think of autism as not simply, not only an "issue of children's health" but as why we need to allocate resources for individuals of autism of all ages, all through their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240348405298"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1505681178943371882">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a90e6cc9144973f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Genome" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">How to Evaluate Genome Level Transcription Papers</title><published>2009-04-21T20:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T21:18:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-evaluate-genome-level.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1505681178943371882/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1505681178943371882" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> It&amp;#39;s often very difficult to evaluate the results of large-scale genome studies.

The Emperor Justinian is known, if at all, for his legal code. The Justinian code was indeed a great success as a codification. It settled numerous disputed points of law and relieved judges and lawyers of the need to consult a huge range of often contradictory legal sources dating back to the Laws of the Twelve Tables, and in some areas, it was progressive. In areas relating to religion and to sex, however, it was just plain awful, in some ways worse than Shari'a Law.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The testimony of those outside the orthodox Christian church, for example, was of no value at all against that of orthodox Christians. The abduction of a woman (by which was meant the removal of a woman from the home of her father or husband without his consent, with or without her consent) was punished by death in an unpleasant form. If the woman consented, she was subject to the same penalty. If she resisted, in which case, one would think, she would be entirely innocent, she was disinherited. If her duena was found to have encouraged her to give in to her seducer, she was to have molten lead poured into her mouth and throat "to close the aperture through which the wicked suggestions had emanated".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justinian's main religious targets were pagans and heterodox Christians (there were no Muslims to persecute yet), and for some reason the Samaritans, but he was relatively tolerant of the Jews. To quote Bury (Volume 2, p. 366):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Though the lawgiver regarded them as "abominable men who sit in darkness," and they were excluded from the State-service, they were not deprived of their civil rights. Justinian recognized their religion as legitimate and respectable so far as to dictate to them how they should conduct the services in their synagogues. He graciously permitted them to read aloud the scriptures in Greek or Latin or other versions. If Greek was the language they were enjoined to use the Septuagint, "which is more accurate than all others", but they were allowed to use also the translation of Aquila. On the other hand, he strictly forbade the use of the "Deuterosis," which he described as the invention of  uninspired mortals. This amazing law is thoroughly characteristic of the Imperial theologian.

&lt;p&gt;Featured in the article is a young woman named Ma Cheng, whose surname Ma is written with the character for "horse" and whose given name Cheng is written with a very rare character composed of three horses lined up closely in a row:  馬  馬馬馬 (the latter character is exceedingly difficult to write in a small square exactly the same size as the space allotted to one horse [and to all other characters, even if they have as many as 64 strokes]!).  The article states that this character pronounced Cheng is not to be found among the 32,252 characters in the Chinese government's computer systems, so Ms. Ma has been told peremptorily that she must change her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this case, I sympathize with the Chinese government, since — as presently constituted — the Chinese script is essentially open-ended.  Anyone can dredge up an obscure, obsolete character for his / her name or invent one from scratch, and people often do just that.  Someone might even choose a character from Xu Bing&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.hanshan.com/specials/xubingts.html"&gt;"Book from the Sky"&lt;/a&gt; (which contains 4,000 characters consisting of perfectly acceptable components rearranged in unprecedented ways), assign a sound and maybe a meaning to it, and claim that this is his / her name.  That way lies chaos — at least in modern society where we depend upon computerized systems for keeping all sorts of records in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, Ms. Ma really doesn't have much of a leg to stand on (no jokes about the twelve legs of the three horses in the character for her given name!).  The reason for this is that the 馬馬馬 character is listed in unabridged lexicons as simply an old form of 騁, which means exactly the same thing ("gallop; indulge in") and sounds exactly the same (CHENG3).  This 騁 is a fairly common character and is found in all modern dictionaries and computer fonts, so the government should kindly but firmly tell Ms. Ma to use 騁 instead of 馬馬馬 for her given name.  No harm done (she still even has one of the three horses to race along with).  I'm actually surprised that they haven't already made this suggestion to Ms. Ma, though perhaps they were unaware of the connection between 馬馬馬 and 騁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I indicated in an &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/?p=1188"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; ("Zhao C:  a Man Who Lost His Name"), I'm not so sympathetic with the Chinese government when they claim that their computer systems cannot accommodate pinyin letters, since pinyin is the official romanization of the PRC and is used widely for countless purposes in the military, in medicine, in archeology, in mathematics, in physics, in education, and so forth.  I believe that the PRC authorities are being disingenuous, if not dishonest, when they say that their computers cannot handle pinyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, if you take the same three horses in Ms. Cheng's given name and stack one of them on top of the other two, thus 驫 (see how hard it is to make out the individual strokes in a densely composed character of this sort), then you get BIAO1 ("like a herd of galloping horses"), which is also less often read as PIAO1 ("name of a river").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, the Chinese government will have to adopt a similar approach to character proliferation as that taken by the Japanese government.  (Judging from their treatment of Ms. Cheng, the PRC government has decided on sooner rather than later.)  Namely, the official Japanese writing system is limited to 996 KANJI for basic education and 949 KANJI for general use, for a total of 1,945 sanctioned characters, plus — as of May 25, 1951 — 92 characters especially for use in names.  The Japanese had better be careful, however, because the list of characters approved for use in names has steadily grown during the following decades, with the current number having reached a whopping 983.  Thus, there is a strong and insistent demand on the part of some parents in Japan for more special characters that they can use to name their children.  Conversely, there is a countercurrent of more and more individuals simply writing their names in the syllabic kana, dispensing with the KANJI altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A nod to Wolfgang Behr for bringing the NYT article to my attention from Switzerland at 4:20 a.m. already before I had seen this morning's newspaper here on the East Coast of the United States!)&lt;/p&gt;

On the lowest reside expressions that incite some people to &lt;strong&gt;rage&lt;/strong&gt;, the symptoms of which are frothing at the mouth, extreme physical revulsion, and an inclination towards violence (up to homicide) against the perpetrator. You hope that all of this is merely verbally hyperbolic, but it's nevertheless disturbing. (We've posted on Language Log a number of times about word rage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One circle up are the &lt;strong&gt;cringe expressions&lt;/strong&gt;, which merely make some people shrink back, but not puke or attack with weaponry. (Again, we've posted a number of times on Language Log about cringe words.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we have the circle of &lt;strong&gt;prejudices&lt;/strong&gt;, expressions that some people merely disapprove of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some of these dislikes are widely shared, disseminating from one person to another or through advice givers of one sort or another. Others are more idiosyncratic, apparently arising from individual experiences with the expressions in question, which gave rise to unpleasant associations — a topic I hope to blog about eventually. There are people, for example, who dislike &lt;em&gt;frankly&lt;/em&gt; as a sentence adverbial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while back, Jan Freeman &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/04/05/being_upfront"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on her &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; column "The Word" on prejudice against &lt;em&gt;foreground&lt;/em&gt; as a verb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;She led with a reader protesting against the appearance of the verb in the paper ("One of the Globe's reporters invented a word", which Freeman pegged as a case of the Recency Illusion), and she then mentioned an objection to the verb in a comment about Stanley Fish's use of it on his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; blog (from someone who maintained he had to read Fish's sentence three times to make sense of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman did a good job of confronting the Recency Illusion (the usage has a long history, in respectable sources, and is even commonplace in some contexts — as a technical term in linguistics, in particular), and she was (politely) dubious about the reader having so much difficulty in figuring out what Fish meant by his use of &lt;em&gt;foreground&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman concluded with an observation echoing things that have often been said on Language Log:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've seen foyer, ointment, egg, and supple on a list of hated words. But where did we get the notion, shared by my reader and Fish's, that our personal dislikes should govern some other adult's vocabulary? It's a mystery of the modern age of peevery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two effects here. One is a close relative of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=92"&gt;grammatical egocentrism&lt;/a&gt;: in this case, someone seems not to understand that their dislikes are in fact personal. I often find it hard to credit that some people haven't noticed that other people don't share their attitudes and behaviors, but the drive to take yourself as the measure of all things seems to be strong: my practice &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the norm. So some of the time, I'll attribute such responses to cluelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second effect is a darker one: the position that your own practices (whether recognized as personal or assumed to be normative) should be &lt;strong&gt;imposed&lt;/strong&gt; on everyone. (I'm talking only about grammar and usage here, though there are obviously wider resonances.) Here, Jan Freeman, the Language Loggers, and many others rise up in protest: you're not the boss of us. You have no right to tell us what to do. You might judge us to be fools or buffoons or oafs, and I suppose that's a shame, but we're not here to please you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s delicious when (as so often happens) someone proposes to impose a usage on the grounds of correctness, though in fact the usage is standard. A case in point: commenter Irene on Geoff Pullum&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Sarah gobsmacked …&amp;quot; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1349"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… to me &amp;quot;no one&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;not one&amp;quot; and takes a singular verb. If you don&amp;#39;t like, &amp;quot;None of us is going&amp;quot;, then say, &amp;quot;We are not going&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Not one of us is going.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(to which Geoff of course replied scathingly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a third effect, brought up by the commenter on Fish: some readers (and hearers) have so much internalized their personal practices (or what they&amp;#39;ve been taught) that they seem (or affect — it&amp;#39;s hard to tell) to have become unable to read (and listen) outside of these. Fish&amp;#39;s reader just can&amp;#39;t parse &lt;em&gt;foreground&lt;/em&gt; as a verb, though he should have been able to work it out on the basis of hundreds or thousands of other verbings he's experienced, even in the unlikely event that the verb &lt;em&gt;foreground&lt;/em&gt; hadn't come past him a number of times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people tell me they "can't understand" sentences with "double negation" ("I didn't see no cat"), because such examples "mean the opposite" of what their users mean (how do these people know what the users of double negation meant?), despite the fact that almost all speakers of English have been exposed to clearly interpretable examples of double negation many thousands of times during their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people tell me that the have trouble understanding sentences that begin with the adverbial connective &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt; ("However, the case is closed"), because they take initial &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt; to be a concessive WH-clause introducer ("However you look at, the case is closed") and then have to correct this misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such people are suffering from the &lt;em&gt;folie&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;intransigence&lt;/strong&gt;, a willful failure to understand. It's uncooperative: instead of working to understand what other people are trying to say, such people are dismissing what others say. It's pig-headed: instead of learning new things about the language from what other people say, such people are simply rejecting the evidence. And, like imposition, it's rude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In some ways, it&amp;#39;s remarkable to see intransigence directed against someone like Stanley Fish. Stigmatized usages tend to get the brunt of the criticism — though there are cases like the sentence-initial connective adverbial &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely very few people are &lt;strong&gt;generally&lt;/strong&gt; egocentric, given to rigid imposition, and intransigent. That would constitute some sort of pathology. Instead, it looks to me like particular people have fixed on a few specifc cases, probably in random fashion: someone noticed some specific example that rubbed them the wrong way, and then formulated a more general objection: a prejudice, a cringe judgment, or full-blown rage. It seems likely to me that some (though not all) of the proscriptions in the advice literature started out in similar fashion. It's just that the complainer had a pulpit to preach from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm suggesting is that some of this is just sunspots.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240341818790"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=9115">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eac8535625b70c56</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="finance"/><category term="university"/><title type="html">The True Cause of College-Tuition Inflation?</title><published>2009-04-21T19:09:04Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T19:09:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/the-true-cause-of-college-tuition-inflation/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">For college students and their parents, the steady spike in tuition prices in recent decades has been not only troubling but mysterious: why on earth is tuition inflation double the general inflation rate?

&lt;p&gt;To commemorate this 19th anniversary, the Hubble folks have released &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/18"&gt;this wonderful image&lt;/a&gt; of interacting galaxies called Arp 194.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/18/image/a/format/xlarge_web/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3463251346_d0d39afcf3_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click to embiggen, or &lt;a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2009-18-a-full_jpg.jpg"&gt;go here to hugely brobdingnangify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s quite a bit going on here! First, take a look at the upper spiral galaxy, located 600 million light years from Earth. If you look at the top spiral arm, you’ll see another galaxy nucleus lying along it; it’s the bright orange patch above and to the right of the big spiral’s center. It looks like that’s the remains of a galaxy that is in the process of colliding with the big spiral (the other bright galaxy — the compact spiral directly to the right of the big spiral’s center — appears to be a background galaxy, coincidentally seen nearby). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collision has drawn out a vast 100,000 light-year-long streamer of gas from the big spiral, which is fairly obvious as the blue ribbon in the middle of the image. This long tongue of gas has collapsed to form millions of stars; the most massive and most luminous are blue, which is why the streamer is that color. Eventually these stars will explode, and then that arm will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; light up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/hst_arp194_detail1.jpg" alt="Hubble image of Arp 194, detail"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there is a galaxy below the interacting pair. Is it associated with them? It seems like it should be, since that blue stream of gas and stars looks like it goes right into that galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact you have to be careful here. In the zoomed image on the right, you can see the lower galaxy and the bottom of the streamer. I’ve indicated three spots in the image; see how they’re redder and darker? That’s because there’s tons of dust there, material which absorbs and reddens the light from stars behind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dust is associated with young stars, so it’s clear this dust must be part of that stretched arm of gas and stars from the upper galaxy. But the dust is seen &lt;em&gt;in front&lt;/em&gt; of the lower galaxy. If the lower galaxy were interacting with the ones above it, you might expect that dust to be mixed in with the galaxy. So it’s possible the lower galaxy is somewhat farther away, unaffiliated with the other galaxies, and untouched by the cosmic disaster. But it’s also possible it’s just a &lt;em&gt;wee&lt;/em&gt; bit farther away, still part of the group, but has still managed to remain unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing: check out the top of that smaller image. See that one star that’s glowing an evil red? That’s probably an evolved star, a red supergiant. If it is, that means it may very well be the next star to go in this scene; red supergiants are stars at the very ends of their lives. It may have less than a million years before it detonates and becomes a supernova, and will outshine the combined light of the galaxies around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it may just be a very distant background galaxy. I doubt it; the positioning of it right in the middle of that streamer is awfully suspicious. But stranger things have happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly two decades in orbit around the Earth, Hubble is still in a position to amaze me. I worked on three different Hubble cameras for a total of a decade, and I have seen literally thousands of images returned by the spaceborne observatory. Yet, even with all that, it still delivers pictures of the Universe that surprise, fascinate, and enthrall me. It’s amazing to think of how much space is out there, how many incredible objects swim in its vastness, and how well we can probe the nature of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble will be serviced one final time by the Shuttle &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;, due to lift off May 12. It will almost certainly continue for several more years after that, but inevitably the time will come to shut the old bird down. By then, though, we’ll have new telescopes, like &lt;a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov"&gt;the James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, ready to step in.&lt;/p&gt;

You can buy it or build it. You can adorn it with faux finishes, faux lapis, strings soaked in glue, making loops, like spaghetti rococco, then paint it, varnish it, maybe gluing on many sparkling, faux jewels or pearls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can do a collage of cut out magazine photos, or seed catalogue flowers or pictures of saints, Gods and Goddesses. You'll come across the most beautiful articles to put on the outside of your box, if you look at graphics, posters, magazines and the calendars made by  the popular painter, THOMAS KINKAID, or Renaissance poster art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web pages are for nerds. Glitter and glued pasta is for Sunday School. You are &lt;i&gt;hardcore&lt;/i&gt;.

The school refused to send applications, lied about classes being full, and repeatedly rejected Alex's applications despite his clear qualifications.  The school has since been taken to a tribunal, lost, and issued an apology to Alex.  Alex has also been given conditional admission to prestigious &lt;a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt;.  However, this is what I want to focus on (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The schoolboy said he used the school's refusal as motivation&lt;/em&gt; and achieved As in three maths subjects and some physics modules. Now he is at another school, studying for the practical physics exam, which he could not take while learning from home and is a condition of his offer from Trinity college, Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said: "Maybe my story at least shows people that even if institutions put this bar up and won't help you and give you an environment where you can be comfortable, at least with enough work and luck you can still do well." Jan Goodenough, Alex's mother, said: "If somebody causes damage to another human being in terms of injury or damaging their career there's compensation, but for special educational needs people there's nothing. It took an enormous amount of time and effort. The only reason I did it was I knew it was so wrong and I wanted justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes me back to when I was the same age as Alex, and all but a few had given up on me.  Institutional placement was being discussed and I was out of chances, out of options, out of balance.  Then a switch flicked over; I recall vividly the moment it struck me, &lt;em&gt;I will prove everyone wrong.  I will succeed where they say I will fail, and show them how wrong they are&lt;/em&gt;.  What I call the "sacred anger" flared in me for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the start, the fuel, the fire of my self-advocacy.  I've never let go since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades later I was chatting with a friend who is also a strong self-advocate about how we each got started on the path.  His story, while some details were different, in essence was identical to my story, and to the story Alex Goodenough relates in the quote above.  Perhaps there is a point of oppression or discrimination where one either dies out or the flames of that sacred anger ignite.  And if the latter, woe to anyone who stands in our way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fierce as this may sound, it is my greatest hope that future generations of self-advocates never have to feel that rage, never have to use the sacred anger, never have to be motivated by discrimination or rejection.  As society changes to better understand, accept, respect, and accommodate us, a gentler path to expressing one's needs can open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the self-advocates out there, what got you started?  Was it a reaction to oppression or discrimination, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello dear Ladies and Gentlemen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would like inform you that Scarlett Johansson “actress” actually is a clone from original person Scarlett Galabekian last name, who has nothing with acting career, 
surname Galabekian, because of adoption happened in 1992. Clones was created illegally by using stolen biological material. Original person is very nice (not d**n sexy), most important - CHRISTIAN young lady! I&amp;#39;ll tell you more, those clones (it&amp;#39;s not only one) made in GERMANY - world leader manufacturer of humans clones, it is in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr. Helmut Kohl home town. You can not even imaging the scale of the cloning activity. But warning! Helmut Kohl clone staff strictly controlling all their clones (at least they trying) spreading around the world, they are very accurate with that, some of them are still NAZI type disciplined and mind controlled clones, so be careful get close with clones you will be controlled as well. Original person is not happy with those movies, images, video, rumors and etc. spreading on media in that way it would be really nice if  we all will try slow down that &amp;#39;&amp;#39;actress&amp;#39;&amp;#39; career development, original Scarlett will really appreciated that. Please remember that original Scarlett Galabekian family did not authorize any activity with stolen biological materials, no matter what form it was created in it was  and it is stolen. It all need to be delivered to authorize personals control in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Original Scarlett never was engaged, by the way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her close friend Serge G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
P.S. CONTROLLING ACTIVITY OF ANY CLONES IS US MILITARY OPERATION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m sure everyone wants to know…what is the mailing address of this cloning factory in Ludwigshafen am Rhein? Are they taking orders for Scarlett Johannsen clones? Do they have any other models in stock?&lt;/p&gt;

He was perhaps unique in having made foundational contributions to both pillars of modern physics: quantum mechanics and general relativity. He helped develop the theory of nuclear fission, and then was an important participant in the Manhattan project. He discussed quantum mechanics with Bohr, relativity with Einstein, and electrodynamics with his student, Feynman. One of Wheeler’s particularly nice calculations (on asymmetrical nuclei) got scooped because Bohr sat on it too long. The person that scooped them, James Rainwater, subsequently won the Nobel prize for the result. In Feynman’s Nobel lecture, he credits Wheeler with many of the key insights. Wheeler mentored over one hundred students, and those students (and grand-students) now populate leading physics departments throughout the world. In addition to his facility with physics, Wheeler displayed a wondrous command over language. His career is partially encapsulated in his coinages: wormhole, black hole, the planck length and time, quantum foam, the sum over histories, the S-matrix, It from Bit, the wavefunction of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/04/13/goodbye/"&gt;John Wheeler passed away&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago. In commemoration of his tremendous contributions to physics, the &lt;a href="http://ptonline.aip.org/dbt/dbt.jsp?KEY=PHTOAD&amp;amp;Volume=62&amp;amp;Issue=4&amp;amp;usertype=indiv"&gt;current edition of Physics Today&lt;/a&gt; (the monthly magazine of the American Physical Society) is dedicated entirely to his memory. [Sadly, only select articles are public, which I find incomprehensible.] The issue includes an article on Wheeler’s early work on particles (written by Ken Ford), as well as one on his later work on fields, gravity, and information (by Charlie Misner, Kip Thorne, and Wojciech Zurek). There are also two reprints of articles authored by Wheeler, one on nuclear fission (describing his pioneering work with Niels Bohr), and one “introducing” black holes (written with Remo Ruffini). As a sign of Wheeler’s enduring legacy, the magazine ends with an article (by Terry Christensen) focused on his tremendous mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to summarize Wheeler’s impact, both as a physicist and as a human being. How do you reduce someone to a few paragraphs, or a few articles, or a few &lt;a href="http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5908_1.html"&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;? Wheeler was unique in his insight, his breadth, his generosity, and his humanity. For those that were fortunate enough to spend time with him, he left an indelible mark. As one of Wheeler’s students put it in the acknowledgment to their thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure to acknowledge the tremendous  support and encouragement given to me by John A. Wheeler. Over the last two years he has introduced me to the world of physics research and shaped the way I think about physics. I have benefited greatly, both as a physicist and as a person, from his example, and will carry this with me always. John Wheeler has had a profound impact on my life and I am deeply indebted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote that over 15 years ago, and it is no less true today.&lt;/p&gt;

We realized that this conversation was probably pretty useful in-front-of the scenes, too.  So I’m going to be putting together some information for you, in a series of posts, on how to avoid pregnancy - long term, short term, mid term, and oops-term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;If you have any questions about a birth control method, comment on the blog or email us a question and I’ll do my best to thoroughly Google it and post my findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;Today’s topics are “Condoms and Whaaaaa?”. I’ll get to condoms - use, options, pros and cons - in a minute, but first I want to talk about misconceptions about how to avoid pregnancy without birth control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;We’re all familiar with the bad advice we’ve all heard (or heard that other people heard). You can’t get pregnant:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;the first time you have sex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if you’re having your period&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if you do it in high heels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if the woman is on top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if you do it standing up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if you do jumping jacks after sex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;if dude pulls out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;But there are a few more myths that, logically, seem to be obvious ways to avoid pregnancy… but they’re not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;So unzip your pants (if you’re still wearing any) and join me on a NSFW  journey through the warring nation-states of Getting and Not-Getting Knocked-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;How not to not get pregnant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anal Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;See? You probably stopped reading to go find something to throw at your computer screen in anger, yelling “You can’t get pregnant from anal fucking sex, Elyse!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;img title="buttsecks" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/buttsecks-150x150.jpg" alt="buttsecks" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;That’s why I’m writing this. You can. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;I’m not jerking your….you know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt; Granted, it’s a fantastic way to reduce your chances of pregnancy versus vaginal sex, but it does not eliminate the chances completely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;The problem here is not that fertilization happens up the butt; the problem is leakage. If sperm leak out of the anus, they can find their way to the vagina where they can swim up and fertilize an egg. The odds of this happening are not great. It’s far less than shooting a wad right up against the cervix, but if your goal is to avoid embroys, use a condom (which will also greatly reduce risk of STD transmission and virtually eliminate risk of male UTI from poo germs.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Humping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;If you listened to the first ever Skepchick podcast, you heard me drunkenly and not so eloquently declare that you can get pregnant from dry-humping (at least I think it was dry-humping) because “you bump and bump and things swim up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;Think of it this way, you know that rubbing together an unsheathed penis with an unsheathed vulva, even sans penetration is a recipe for disaster, right? (If not, see anal sex, but this time dart lands even closer to the bulls eye.) Dry humping is essentially doing this, but with a soft (or seemingly soft at first) denim sieve between you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;Do this test: dump a couple tablespoons of milkshake on your pants. If anything goes through, they do not protect against pregnancy or STDs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dry Humping tip: Your mom&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;em&gt;know what that stain is on your pants. Do your own laundry or at least buy yourself a &lt;a href="http://www1.tide.com/en_US/tidetogo/index.jsp#/real-stories"&gt;Tide pen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand jobs, Blow jobs, and other types of -jobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;img src="http://yalenewhavenhealth.org/emergency/influenza/images/WashHands2.jpg" alt="" width="95" height="127"&gt;These acts will almost always be safe for pregnancy prevention. But the important thing to remember here is that &lt;em&gt;anything &lt;/em&gt;that has touched the tip of the penis during play, the entire penis following play, and/or any semen should not touch the vulva or the vulva’s neighbors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;If you give your dude a hand job, and you have to pee shortly after, wash your hands before you wipe. And use common sense - like don’t use your panties to clean up the mess then wear them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;The moral of the story is that sperm can live up to 5 days. If you keep them warm they’re going to try to find an egg util they die. Don’t give them that chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Boy Condoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Female condoms will be discussed in a future post)&lt;a href="http://antwerp.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/children_condom1.JPG?w=418&amp;amp;h=383"&gt;&lt;img src="http://antwerp.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/children_condom1.JPG?w=418&amp;amp;h=383" alt="" width="249" height="229"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condoms are a fantastic option for immediate-term to short-term birth control. Though, if you can cope with them, they can be used long-term as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I think once a couple decides they’re in it for the long haul, condoms are one of the first things to go (right before the illusion that neither partner farts). And that’s only for couples that have been bothering to use them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condoms get a bad rap for being uncomfortable and inconvenient. But they’re the only form of birth control that provides a physical, visible barrier of protection (so you know it’s there and can see that it’s working or not) and that helps eliminate risk of most STDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using condoms doesn’t have to be an awkward burden. With styles ranging from glow-in-the-dark to flavored to enhanced-pleasure (and I don’t mean the old ribbed-style that has failed to, even once, increase any woman’s pleasure), condoms can be F-U-N! Yes, even though your penis is glowing in the dark, you’re still going to have to block out the inevitable hair-yank to come. Just try to, you know, keep your eye on the pink ribbon. (Also, if you buy fun-style condoms, check the box to make sure they are intended to prevent pregnancy and protect against STDs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People used to have to deal with allergy issues hampering condom use. Nonoxynol-9 and latex being the culprits. Unfortunately, I don’t see anything overthrowing nonoxynol-9’s reign as king of the sperm-exterminators, but there are plenty of other non-spermicidal lubes. The good news for those allergic is that nonoxynol should not be used by frequent condom users anyway because it will irritate the skin, even for those not allergic. That irritation can cause abrasions, increasing risk of HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latex allergy sufferers used to have 2 options: something else or lambskin. Neither of those options protect against HIV and not using condoms at all puts you at risk for other STDs. Fortunately, now there are polyurethane (and similar materials) condoms. These are a little more expensive, but they’re just as efficient and they’re thinner. They are a fantastic option for someone who likes condoms in theory, but hates them in practice. The new non-latex options offer increased sensitivity for the guy. If you’ve always hated condoms, but know you should be using them, give these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condom Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay-per-use. They only cost you if you use them, and at less than $1 per romp, unless you’re doing it more than once a day, it’s one of the most cost-efficient ways to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protects against disease. With the exception of HPV and Herpes, you can protect yourself against virtually all STDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t have to rely on one partner or the other to be protected. Either partner can buy them and keep them handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only form of birth control available for men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-the-counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used with other forms of birth control as backup/STD protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be incorporated into sexy time. Your partner can put it on or you can put it on… it can be applied by hand or by mouth. It’s actually way hotter to put a condom on your guy than it is for him to insert your IUD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;98% effective against pregnancy when used properly (85% when used improperly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condom Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some varieties are only intended for fun use and not pregnancy or disease prevention (if you can eat them, don’t use them for protection)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires a time-out in the middle of the action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dulls sensation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible allergic reactions to latex or nonoxynol-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive use of nonoxynol-9 can increase risk of STD transmission due to causing skin irritation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a video on how to properly apply a condom. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy sexing!&lt;/p&gt;

This is the idea that scientific truth is impossible and that all our ideas about the world are "socially constructed", that is, that people negotiate agreements about what the world is like and thus determine what is real. Being a realist, I am convinced that there is a single real world out there, and that though not infallible, science is finding out a lot of true information about it. (Just as I am able to find out in a non-socially-constructed way whether there is any milk in the fridge.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I am a fan of Ursula K. LeGuin. So I was irked when I read the last few stories in her otherwise fine 1994 short story collection &lt;i&gt;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&lt;/i&gt;. Here she introduces (and, luckily, promptly drops) a post-modernist warp drive for space ships, the "churten drive".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In "The Shobies' Story" and "Dancing to Ganaan", we learn that the churten drive will take your space ship instantaneously to another place regardless of distance. Trouble is, you won't arrive until everybody aboard the ship has negotiated an agreement about what the destination is like. In fact, the destination apparently doesn't exist until such an agreement has been reached. Gah.&lt;/p&gt;

I admit it. So why do I find this &lt;a href="http://www.artlies.org/article.php?id=1718&amp;amp;issue=61&amp;amp;s=0"&gt;article about hunting octopus in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; so entertaining? I mean, the guy is diving down, stabbing the octopus between the eyes with a pointy stick, and then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next step: the octopus must be tenderized by slamming it against a large rock at least a hundred times or more. When its natural color changes to white, I rinse it repeatedly in sea water and drag it back and forth over a rough rock surface with a rhythmic motion. A white foam is released, and this movement must continue until all the foam disappears. When the muscle has completely relaxed, the texture of the flesh changes and the color turns to a grayish white. I grab two tentacles and pull them apart gently…the flesh should tear. Then—and only then—is the octopus ready for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are recipes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/points-and-poisson-davril/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/randomizeddots.jpg" alt="Random dots"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with questions like this is that you already know it’s the one on the left that’s random, and the one on the right isn’t, since you know I’m trying to trick you. But what’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains love to find patterns in random noise. Look at the clumping of the dots on the left; surely that’s not random? But it is. The distance between dots will average out to some number, but statistically you expect there to be some deviation from that average, so that some dots will be closer together (making clumps) and some farther apart (making voids). That’s what’s happening on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right, the random pattern that was generated was modified so that the dots would not be too close together. If a dot’s position was found to be too close to another, its position was redone until it was a minimum distance from all other dots. What’s left is a pattern that we think looks more random, but is in fact highly &lt;strong&gt;non&lt;/strong&gt;-random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more detailed explanation of these images is at the blog &lt;a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/points-and-poisson-davril/"&gt;In The Dark,&lt;/a&gt; and he uses it to talk about galaxy distributions. However, it also tells us a lot about our brains. We are instinctively lousy at statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great example is this one: imagine you flip a coin ten times, and you keep track. Which of these sequences is more likely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HHHHHTTTTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;or&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TTHHTHHTTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is &lt;em&gt;they are both exactly as likely&lt;/em&gt;. You have a 50/50 shot at a heads or tails on each throw, so any 10-throw sequence is just as likely as any other! But we look at the second sequence and see no information in it. We assume it’s just random, and therefore more likely than a sequence where we &lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt; there is information, like five heads in a row followed by five tails. But each is just as likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We view the entire Universe through our senses, and the data are processed by our brains. This gloppy computer is highly sophisticated, but also highly unreliable to give us unbiased information. We see patterns where they don’t exist, we see cause where they may be none, and we see intent where there may be randomness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why pareidolia — seeing faces or other familiar objects in random patterns like oil stains, wood grain, and the odd piece of bark of pastry item — cracks me up. The brain of a human will interpret that pattern into something familiar, and if that person is religious, they see a religious icon. But they don’t seem to hang the same connotation on seeing &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/lenin.html"&gt;Abe Vigoda in a nebula and Lenin in a shower curtain&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/12/21/the-grimm-supernova/"&gt;Ben Grimm in a supernova&lt;/a&gt;, or any of a hundred examples I can find easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can be fooled&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember that, always. It pertains to a lot in life, and a lot in the life of an active skeptic. Fooling people is easy. Getting them to see? That’s what’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240321564651"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6975">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b0d29cc9fc10290</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 4.21</title><published>2009-04-21T13:15:17Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T13:15:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6975" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Christians who would like to argue with me can do so. Skeptics who would like to bone up on the arguments as well as pick a bone with me will be able to do so. Students in ethics or philosophy classes can get special personal tutoring from me. Christians who struggle with their faith can talk things over with me. And former Christians who want to vent or ask advice about their personal pain can do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details will be forthcoming, probably very soon. This will be exciting.

I know it makes for eye-catching headlines, and of course that is the point, but really - Mitchell has been going around to UFO groups making the same claims for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that separates Mitchell from your average UFO believer is that he is a former astronaut.  This gives his claims a superficial air of authority, but when you actually examine his claims you find that they are not based upon his tenure as an astronaut. It is not as if he met aliens while he was in orbit. He has been a bit coy about how his time at NASA plays into his claims. He leaves open the suggestion that he was privy to inside information about UFOs in NASA, but has nothing concrete to give. (NASA, of course, denies any cover up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the stories he is pushing lately have more to do with the fact that he grew up in Roswell, New Mexico. He claims that the citizens of Roswell were bullied by the US government to be silent about what they know - Roswell being the site of an alleged UFO crash in 1947. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(They) didn’t want to go to the grave with their story. They wanted to tell somebody reliable. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow - uncorroborated second-hand anecdotes. That is just what UFO claims need to gain credibility. And that is really all he has - second-hand stories. No evidence. He explains the lack of evidence by invoking the big, dark, government conspiracy, involving at least NASA and the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to be skeptical of Michell’ claims. The first, of course, is that there is no compelling evidence of a crashed saucer at Roswell in 1947. All of the hard evidence is compatible with the official story (which was initially covered up for national security reasons) - a crashed weather balloon carrying a corner reflector that was being used by &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/9507/roswell.html"&gt;project Mogul&lt;/a&gt; to spy on Soviet nuclear testing.  The crashed saucer story was sparked by the off-hand remarks of an army press officer, but quickly died as the truth (actually a more plausible lie - the secret project Mogul was sold as a regular weather balloon) came to light. The story was resurrected decades later by UFO authors, and as UFO mythology evolved the details were retrofitted into the Roswell story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general UFO believers, like Mitchell, find the stories that some people tell about Roswell, long after the fact, to be compelling, while skeptics do not. In my opinion this stems largely from an inadequate appreciation on the part of the believers for how stories can be manufactured and propagated, how memories can morph over time, and how mythologies can spontaneously come into existence, spread, and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roswell tale has all the hallmarks of a modern mythology. That does not mean, however, that part of the story cannot also be true. Historians deal with this conundrum all the time - every culture has its stories and legends, but which ones are based upon historical events, and how have those events been distorted. What we need are objective pieces of evidence that can confirm specific elements of the Roswell story. And that is exactly what we do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have claims that such evidence exists, but that it is being covered up by the government. But we don’t have the evidence itself. There are no pieces of a spaceship with extraterrestrial alloys, no alien bodies, not even any photographs or video of these things. We do have photographs of wreckage that looks like a mundane corner reflector, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have discussed in other contexts before, I also do not find claims for a massive conspiracy compelling.  This is too casually used to explain the lack of any compelling evidence, and to dismiss evidence that supports non-UFO conclusions. To clarify (I always have to do this), I do not categorically dismiss the possibility of a cover up or conspiracy. Clearly they exist - and in this case the US Government covered up Project Mogul for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, conspiracies become harder to maintain the larger they become. A crashed saucer and aliens at Roswell would require a huge conspiracy of silence over many decades, agencies, and administrations. I frankly don’t think our government has the capability of maintaining such a large cover up for so long. There would be too many opportunities for hard evidence to leak out. You would also have to believe in a shadow government, free from the oversight of elected officials, to accept such a conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also never found compelling the motivation for such a cover up. OK - initially the feds may have panicked and decided to cover up a crashed saucer until they figured out what it meant and what they should do with it. But 60 plus years later - what’s the motivation? The standard reply, which Mitchell repeats, is to avoid panic in the streets. This excuse becomes less and less credible over time. What if the government is hiding an ongoing relationship with the aliens? This just broadens the conspiracy, makes the cover up more massive and therefore more implausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find it implausible that an alien race would have the technology to build a ship that could travel to the Earth from another stellar system, only to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course none of this proves there was no crashed saucer at Roswell - these are a plausibility arguments. It contains assumptions, but I think they are reasonable.  They are reasons to increase our level of skepticism, which in practice means that our demands for hard evidence are increased before we accept the claim as probably true. What we have are severe plausibility issues with an absence of any hard evidence, and a highly plausible alternative explanation that explains all available evidence well. The Roswell story also fits well into our understanding of how mythologies are generated, spread, and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until some concrete evidence comes to light, there is simply no new news here. Mitchell repeating the same-old tired claims of the UFO community is not news.&lt;/p&gt;

In this case, it's not so much a review as a cheerful dismemberment and deposition of the fragmented corpse into an acid bath. John Polkinghorne has written another of those books of religious apologetics that tries to claim the privilege of scientific thought while not engaging any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Polkinghorne's former student Nicholas Beale runs a website on behalf of his mentor, on which questions about religion, and the relation of religion to science, can be posted. This apparently self-published book is a compilation of 51 of these website questions with Beale's and sometimes Polkinghorne's answers. The questions range over creation, the existence of evil, evolution, intelligent design and most of the other familiar old debating points, plus "How does the death of Jesus save the world?", "Why believe Jesus rose from the dead?" and "How much do you need to believe to be a Christian?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since these latter questions premise membership of the asylum already, I shall focus just on the various questions that touch on the relation of science and religion, because the interest attaching to Polkinghorne is that he is a physicist who became a Church of England vicar, which makes people think that he has a special line into the science-religion question.

Welcome to the second day of &lt;a href="http://www.rbm.who.int/worldmalariaday/"&gt;World Malaria Day&lt;/a&gt; [week] at the Bug Blog! I’ve talked several times about the way in which different mosquitoes respond differently to pesticides for malarial control, but here’s a new twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study to compare different species of mosquito in their &lt;em&gt;ability to be a malarial vector&lt;/em&gt;, there were very large differences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a review– a &lt;strong&gt;disease vector&lt;/strong&gt; is an organism that does not cause disease itself, but transmits an infection by transporting pathogens from one host to another. The malarial parasite is alive inside the mosquito, although they don’t get malaria–but they can give it to us, the host. In this research, different mosquitoes were compared in their abilities to serve as a vector for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the claims frequently made by the “&lt;a title="a summary" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/06/29/ddt-and-attacks-on-rachel-carson-the-cliffsnote-version/"&gt;DDT will solve everything”&lt;/a&gt; crowd is that just spraying enough DDT will kill all the malarial mosquitoes.  This ignores that mosquitoes vary widely from population to population, and species to species, in their ability to resist DDT.  They aren’t all the same, and there is no one size-fits-all control method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research I &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/new-malaria-research/"&gt;discussed yesterda&lt;/a&gt;y is another good example of the variability problem–predicting malaria using weather and other environmental data in different areas of Africa required different solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, you can get a sense of another layer of difficulty in controlling malaria. The experiments looked at two different strains of malarial parasite (Thai and Korean), and 3 different mosquito species.  That’s a lot of potential variation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did they find out?&lt;a href="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/malaria_lifecycle.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="malaria_lifecycle" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/malaria_lifecycle.gif?w=119&amp;amp;h=96" alt="malaria_lifecycle" width="119" height="96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into the specifics–you can read the paper if you want to see technical words like “sporogony”–but basically, not all of the mosquito species were able to support the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/biology/life_cycle.htm"&gt;malarial parasites’ life cycle&lt;/a&gt;.  (BTW, this diagram is probably the single greatest cause of drinking in invertebrate zoology students. The names! The stages! Ugh!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infecting a mosquito with the malarial parasite isn’t enough–the parasite has to change, migrate out of the gut of the mosquito, and into its salivary glands.  Not all mosquito bodies are equally friendly to this process–there were large differences between the 3 mosquitoes tested in this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this gives you a sense of the complex layers of difficulty surrounding malarial control–in addition to the environmental variability  from location to location discussed &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/new-malaria-research/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and variation in pesticide resistance which&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/new-malaria-research-insecticide-cross-resistance/"&gt; I’ve discussed before&lt;/a&gt;, there are also large genetic differences within mosquito species, mosquito populations, and malarial parasites. It’s a spaghetti tangle of variables, many of which we have no control over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is why there is no easy solution to malaria, and why after centuries, we are only now beginning to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are making progress! Just not as fast as we’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Now I'm writing this sort of squatting with my bottom braced up against the hangar's west wall, &lt;strong&gt;which wall &lt;/strong&gt;is white-painted cinder blocks, like a budget motel's wall, and also oddly clammy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the MeFites began a &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/120024/And-so-I-found-myself-asking-this-for-some-sort-of-reassurance-which-question-would-be-fielded-by-AskMefis-language-nerds-with-bewildering-rapidity#1718092"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You know how "whom" exists to clarify that you aren't asking "who?", but telling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charitable thing is to take this absurd question as a joke, parodying the ambiguity-avoidance arguments for stylistic choices that Arnold Zwicky has often &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003721.html"&gt;dissected&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it's not very funny. But it has the virtue of reminding me of a genuinely funny parody of &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt;-related usage advice, from James Thurber's &lt;em&gt;Ladies' and Gentlemen's Guide to Modern English Usage&lt;/em&gt;. In case some of you haven't seen this small masterpiece, I reproduce it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The number of people who use "whom"        and "who" wrongly is appalling. The problem is a difficult one        and it is complicated by the importance of tone, or taste. Take the common        expression, "Whom are you, anyways?" That is of course, strictly        speaking, correct - and yet how formal, how stilted! The usage to be preferred        in ordinary speech and writing is "Who are you, anyways?" "Whom"        should be used in the nominative case only when a note of dignity or austerity        is desired. For example, if a writer is dealing with a meeting of, say,        the British Cabinet, it would be better to have the Premier greet a new        arrival, such as an under-secretary, with a "Whom are you, anyways?"        rather than a "Who are you, anyways?" - always granted that the        Premier is sincerely unaware of the man's identity. To address a person        one knows by a "Whom are you?" is a mark either of incredible        lapse of memory or inexcusable arrogance. "How are you?" is a        much kindlier salutation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The Buried Whom, as it is called, forms a special problem. That is where          the word occurs deep in a sentence. For a ready example, take the common          expression: "He did not know whether he knew her or not because he          had not heard whom the other had said she was until too late to see her."          The simplest way out of this is to abandon the "whom" altogether          and substitute "where" (a reading of the sentence that way will          show how much better it is). Unfortunately, it is only in rare cases that          "where" can be used in place of "whom." Nothing could          be more flagrantly bad, for instance, than to say "Where are you?"          in demanding a person's identity. The only conceivable answer is "Here          I am," which would give no hint at all as to whom the person was.          Thus the conversation, or piece of writing, would, from being built upon          a false foundation, fall of its own weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A common rule for determining whether "who" or "whom"          is right is to substitute "she" for "who," and "her"          for "whom," and see which sounds the better. Take the sentence,          "He met a woman who they said was an actress." Now if "who"          is correct then "she" can be used in its place. Let us try it.          "He met a woman she they said was an actress." That instantly          rings false. It can't be right. Hence the proper usage is "whom."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In certain cases grammatical correctness must often be subordinated to          a consideration of taste. For instance, suppose that the same person had          met a man whom they said was a street cleaner. The word "whom"          is too austere to use in connection with a lowly worker, like a street-cleaner,          and its use in this form is known as False Administration or Pathetic          Fallacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;You might say: "There is, then, no hard and fast rule?" ("was          then" would be better, since "then" refers to what is past).          You might better say (or have said): "There was then (or is now)          no hard and fast rule?"

I’ll start with some background.  As many of you know, I come from a very religious family.  They had been devoutly Catholic throughout my childhood, but due to a confluence of several spiritual experiences by several different family members about 15 years ago, pretty much the entire extended family on my Mom’s side (which consists of her 7 siblings, their respective spouses, and their 30-some collective kids) coalesced into a very cohesive, charismatic Catholic enclave.  As the second oldest member of my generation, and the first to openly leave the church, I’ve often felt very much an outsider with regard to my family for many years now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a frequent cause of sadness and anxiety for me, not just because they are my family, and I love them, but also because I think they are mostly really cool people that share many of my quirks and interests.  Christian or atheist, we are all, in one way or another, geeks.  Which I love.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has been that for a very long time now, every time I would see them, the conversation would inevitably turn to matters of religion or politics, and certain family members would go on and on as though everyone in the room was on the same page (And how could anyone not be on the same page?  They were right, after all.) which basically made me feel invisible, and put me in the position of deciding whether to stand up and argue the other side, alone, or just remain invisible.  So I mostly stayed quiet, seething inwardly and venting later to understanding friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, I was dreading Easter dinner with my family.  I wondered if I should waste a precious day off from my current 70 hour/week schedule feeling like a pariah, and almost didn’t go.  But, hopeful as always, I decided to brave it, if nothing else for the kick-ass food.  I’m glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the obligatory mealtime prayer, I heard no mention of either religion or politics.  I had pleasant and casual conversation with my Mom’s sisters about books, Tim3P0 and I geeked out with a cousin about the rocket sled on Mythbusters (which is still blowing my mind, btw), the food was indeed awesome, and we basically had a great time.  I hope this isn’t a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, I’ve been thinking about what’s changed.  I think it comes down to critical mass.  As the members of my generation have begun to come of age and bring new significant others (I have to say, I was ecstatic to see two of my cousins accompanied by punk-rock-looking, pierced girlfriends) and spouses into the family, we’ve started to diversify a bit.  I’m no longer the only non-Catholic, and I think we’ve reached a point where they can’t be sure who agrees with them and who doesn’t, so they tend to keep things light and relatively secular in this relatively new influx of mixed company.  I hope the trend continues, because I think it’s important to be exposed to many different kinds of people.  It expands our in-group, and I think it makes us better human beings.  Plus, I really like hanging out with my family, and look forward to getting to know more about them in other ways than their religious views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does all this self indulgent spouting have to do with the skeptical movement?  Well, I’ve noticed some things lately that are making me think we’re approaching a similar critical mass in society at large.  Maybe I’ve got my rose-colored glasses on, but it seems like we’re starting to get noticed, and I think we’re starting to make a difference.  Due in large part, I think, to the visibility of the New Atheist movement, more and more nonbelievers are realizing that they aren’t alone, and they’re getting together and speaking out with a confidence few had known previously.  Many of these people are also skeptics, who, prior to being exposed to the online atheist community, didn’t realize that there was also a community of skeptics.  I am one of them.  These are my biased perceptions, of course, and I may be completely off base, but I think it would be interesting to look at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean, and why bring it up at all?  Well, I think it’s good to see some progress for all our hard work; it keeps us going.  There is still a hell of a lot of bullshit out there, and I don’t delude myself that it will ever be gone entirely, but we are an ever growing force in the battle for reason, and that makes me very hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So keep speaking up, and writing, and activism-ing, and thinking, and living, and building up to that critical mass which will make us impossible to ignore.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240306748126"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/theoretical_ecology_of_vampire.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db1da6c8d386e26a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Theoretical ecology of vampires</title><published>2009-04-21T09:51:58Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T09:51:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BBtYvc8kwrQ/theoretical_ecology_of_vampire.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/theoretical_ecology_of_vampire.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I find this hilarious — it&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/2009/04/20/vampire-ecology/"&gt;exercise in applying the mathematics of population ecology to the dynamics of human-vampire interactions&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometimes that criticism is justified. I have run across a conventional practice that I suspect began because it sounded like a good idea, but that never was adequately tested and is not carefully thought out for individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had a bone marrow aspiration. The written instructions said not to eat or drink for 6 hours before the procedure, to bring someone to drive me home, and to expect an IV. I suspected from these instructions that they were planning to use IV sedation, and I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I questioned the need for sedation. I am prejudiced about bone marrow aspirations. I observed several and did one myself during my internship. When I had finished, the patient asked me when I was going to start. We did the procedure at the patient’s bedside in a multi-bed ward with no sedation, only local anesthesia. So my prejudice was that the procedure was no big deal and was not terribly painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine that some patients may be terrified by the idea of a needle going into their bone and may want to be sedated and not remember the experience. But I was not anxious about it, and I saw no need for the fentanyl and Versed they wanted to give me. I figured it would only prolong my time in the hospital, produce amnesia, expose me to a small risk of adverse effects, and leave me groggy; so I asked to opt out. They readily agreed - although they did keep asking me if I was &lt;em&gt;really sure&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t want it. They would not have offered the option of no sedation if I had not known to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathologist doing the procedure told me the injection of local anesthetic into the skin was the most painful part of the procedure. He was wrong. It was the ONLY painful part of the procedure. The penetration of bone and the aspiration of marrow produced only a pressure sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9054704?ordinalpos=11&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; reported that 85% of non-sedated patients had intense pain. I find that hard to believe, based on my personal experience and the experience of the pathologist that the local anesthetic was the worst part of the procedure. I wonder if those patients were anxious and were &lt;em&gt;expecting&lt;/em&gt; intense pain. At any rate, I think giving me IV sedation would have been the wrong thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience with an excisional breast biopsy. They offered me general or local anesthesia and I chose local as presumably the safer option. Then they said they would use IV sedation along with the local. I asked why. They said to relieve anxiety. I told them I wasn’t anxious so if that was the only reason for sedation, I didn’t want it. I finally prevailed. I was comfortable, alert, had a good time chatting with the anesthesiologist, and was able to leave the recovery room much sooner than sedated patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that IV sedation is not indicated for some patients, but I am convinced it was not indicated for me. Has it become a knee-jerk reflex to sedate everyone as a general principle? Why? To avoid complaints and keep patients more cooperative during procedures? Are we paternalistically deciding that it is better if the patients don’t remember the procedure? I wonder: if minor procedures are not remembered, might the mystery increase anxiety and fear of the unknown for future procedures? We must ask seriously whether IV sedation is done more for the patient’s benefit or the doctor’s. The answer will vary with the procedure and the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than sedating every patient, why not use some judgment? Even if the patient is anxious, perhaps a non-drug option could relieve that anxiety without risking the side effects of drugs. Surely some anxiety is due to fear of the unknown. Would it help to show patients a video of someone comfortably undergoing the procedure without sedation, with an explanation of exactly what was happening? Would simple reassurance or personal attention from a patient advocate be helpful? Worth looking into? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are frequently accused of prescribing unnecessary drugs out of habit or reflex. I suggest that IV sedation for minor procedures is an example of over-prescription that is based more on custom than on good evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A colleague of mine asked a great question: if you have one question to ask a booster of so-called alternative medicine in a public forum, what should it be?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which he responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My answer: "Can you please give specific examples of alternative medicine theories and modalities that have been abandoned because they have been found to be ineffective?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to agree. If there's one difference between so-called "alternative" medicine and science- and evidence-based medicine, it's that ineffective therapies in general are abandoned. Now, I don't claim that it always happens as fast as it should. All too often it does not. Sometimes, in extreme cases, it takes the older generation of doctors retiring and dying off and the newer generation taking over. Nor do I claim that the process isn't messy. Scientific and clinical studies often take years to shake out, and in the meantime there can be a great deal of confusion. But make no mistake. Ineffective therapies &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; disappear in science-based medicine. The examples are legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now contrast that to "alternative medicine," where "ancient wisdom" is prized and faith-based "cures" are the rule. Is there any "alternative medicine" that CAM practitioners have ever stopped using because the evidence showed it not to work? I can't think of any. Homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, for example, have time and time again been shown to be nothing more than water and faith healing, respectively. Yet they are as popular as ever among CAM practitioners. That's why this is an excellent question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there must be others. What other questions directed at a CAM believer could limn the essential difference, the faith-based nature of CAM, for a general audience? For me, the question would be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What specific evidence would it take to convince you that homeopathy {or whatever woo the CAM practitioner believes in} is ineffective medicine?" Then I would press for specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;

Carolyn Komich Hare is a former special ed teacher, the mother of a child on the autism spectrum, and the founder of AHEADD (Achieving in Higher Education with Autism/Developmental Disabilities) a Pittsburgh-based national group she founded seven years ago. In the April 18th &lt;a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/breaking/s_621298.html"&gt;Pittsburgh Live&lt;/a&gt; she says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus with autism is on small children, diagnosing them early and getting them through school. When they get out of school, people with autism are usually neglected............&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is starting to change. In the next three to four years, many autistic kids will be finishing school and will need help with the transition to work or higher education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komich also noted that "nearly all government funding for autism is directed toward secondary school-age children"----an imbalanced situation when you think it. Certainly my son Charlie is going to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autistic_adults_are_not_large_children"&gt;be an adult for far longer than he'll be a child&lt;/a&gt;. But look at the websites for most autism organizations or books and other resources about autism and you'll generally see that they're illustrated with photos of children, often young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've frequently noted that my son has been growing a lot. He's almost 5' 6" now (he'll turn 12 next month). While he's not at the same level as his peers academically, Charlie is most certainly growing up and so my focus has been more and more on the needs of older children, teenagers, and adults. And so on Friday I went to Baltimore to speak to &lt;a href="http://jhu.mystudentgroups.com/groups/157"&gt;ANCHOR&lt;/a&gt;, a student group at &lt;a href="http://www.jhu.edu"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;. ANCHOR stands for "Advocates for Neurodiversity Creating Hope, Opportunities, and Resources" and the group advocates for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a new perspective towards cognitive differences like autism as complex human variations rather than pathological states. ANCHOR presents service opportunities through interactions with college students with Asperger's Syndrome, networking opportunities with health and law professionals, and policy advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the audience was college students, some of whom were on the spectrum. Three mothers were also present, with their children, one of whom was 14; the other two were adults (one of whom was not yet certain if might be on the spectrum or not). I was asked to speak along with Mike Liu, who is a graduate student in neuroscience at Johns Hopkins (and who had just turned in his thesis on Friday---congratulations!). We focused our presentations on autism and ethnicity and, specifically, being Asian American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike drew on the story of Harry Potter to explain about what growing up was like for him; noted how he learned he has Asperger's while in graduate school; and also drew on wine as an analogy for the autism spectrum. (Yes, wine---so many different types and tastes.....) Mike spoke about how he came to understand his being on the spectrum, and his growing awareness of his strengths and their relation to this. He spoke about having a loud voice and of not always having been aware of this. He noted that, when working in a hospital, he had originally been assigned to the emergency room; he was instead assigned to work in a geriatic unit, and this worked out well. Many of the patients in that unit were hard of hearing and Mike's loud voice was an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke about the different reactions (at first) of my Chinese-American family and of Jim's Irish Jersey Catholic family to Charlie's diagnosis; noted how much my family and in particular &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ode_to_family"&gt;my parents&lt;/a&gt; have helped us by taking care of Charlie; spoke about how it's very likely that we'll &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-bicoastal-boy/"&gt;end up living in California&lt;/a&gt; when Charlie is an adult, as I have a large extended family that has a strong sense of taking care of its own and hope that some of them will look out for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both talked about the numerous &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_myths_psa"&gt;myths of autism&lt;/a&gt; and also about the Model Minority myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Model Minority myth, "Asian cultural values of hard work, family cohesion, self-sufficiency and a drive for success [have] propelled recent immigrants into and beyond the American middle class within a generation or two" (from the April 25, 2007, &lt;a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April07/modelminority.html"&gt;Cornell Chronicle Online&lt;/a&gt;). The Model Minority myth was popularized in the media about 30 years ago and has since come under fire. "The perception of one group's achievements .... then used to pit Asian Americans against African Americans and other groups": If Asian American could be so successful, it was argued, why couldn't others just do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike pointed out that there's a similar myth at work in discussions about autism. As I understood this, it's that there's an assumption that, because individuals with Asperger's are on the "higher" end of the autism spectrum, they should "just" be able to succeed and not need services and supports, and (as the argument goes) are thus to be distinguished from those who are on the "severer" end of the autism spectrum. This is definitely a myth to be addressed and debunked. Individuals at all ends of the autism spectrum have needs, though these vary greatly, as do the approaches used to addressed them. But the needs remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many of the conversations I've had with parents over the past years have centered on setting up home therapy programs, getting OT and figuring out sensory issues, finding pediatricians and dentists, preparing for IEP meetings, finding activities like gymnastics or Challenger league and helping a child get through it. On Friday, I found myself referring only in passing to these, and focusing on Charlie growing up---including some of the seering difficulties of the past year----and to what he'll need for his whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually Charlie and I spend Friday afternoon with just the two of us. Charlie has a snack after getting off the bus and maybe does some homework, and there's that weekend feel. We usually drive into Jersey City and park at my office and walk down Kennedy Boulevard to the PATH train, and get take-out and eat in Jim's office and then take the subway to lower Manhattan, walk a ways to the PATH at the WTC station, and then, after getting back to Journal Square in Jersey City, walk back to the black car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me being in Baltimore for the afternoon and evening, Jim was in Jersey to meet Charlie at the bus. They went on a rather balky bike ride: Jim had raised Charlie's seat (Charlie &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; grown and he was doing a lot of the Barney Rubble feet-operating-the-rock-car kind of thing instead of pedaling) and Charlie was very uncertain about the added height, so the ride was not the long long one Jim was envisioning. Jim sensed that Charlie was unnerved by feeling so much higher up and kept getting off the bike and pausing. After they got home---Friday was a gorgeous day here---they went to Charlie's favorite hamburger stand and ate outside at a picnic table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got home past midnight. Charlie was sound asleep when I looked in on him. Saturday I had to leave early to go to Open House at my college and spent the morning talking to soon-to-be-college students/still high school students and their parents, who were all just a bit anxious at the changes ahead of them (who wouldn't be?). Around noon I called Jim just as he and Charlie were heading out for another bike ride. They were out when I got home and only came back after an hour and a half plus, with Charlie pedaling mightily and steadily, and looking taller than ever (well, he is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess he's grown into that raised seat. And before you know it, he'll be growing into a new, adult-size bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to everyone at ANCHOR for inviting me to speak and wonderful to meet you, Mike!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240299355102"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cce5f96c0d82f344</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Failing Marx</title><published>2009-04-21T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/consumerdebt.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Does a passage from Karl Marx's Das Kapital about consumer debt foretell that current economic turmoil will lead to communism?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1240293727151"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3019">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2b0cc59d672ef48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conspiracy Theories"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Freedom of Speech"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="book burning"/><category term="libertarians"/><category term="mass hysteria"/><category term="Republicans"/><category term="teabaggers"/><title type="html">“Burn the books!”</title><published>2009-04-21T06:00:57Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T06:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/burn-the-books/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I could have sworn I’d included this video in a previous blog but I can’t seem to find it anywhere.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/in_case_you_wondered_if_david_irving_was.php"&gt;Well one man has taken today to publicly announce that Hitler’s birthday is in actuality a cause for celebration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just briefly remember: today is the 120th anniversary of the birth of the man whose mighty armies ultimately saved Western Europe - and the world - from Bolshevism. Let us never forget.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have the cajones to make such a statement? Why that would be none other than Holocaust Denie–err, I mean “Holocaust Revisionist” David Irving, a man who has been imprisoned in Germany for “revisionist” views of the Holocaust and who has flat-out denied accusations that he admired Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve blogged about Irving before &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/07/30/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-72908/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/random-house-published-for-self-censorship-playing-devils-advocate-for-free-speech/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, when I discussed how I actually supported Christopher Hitchens’ criticisms of the publishers who backed out after initially agreeing to publish Irving’s nonsense. Just because I defend the man’s right to spout out his utter nonsense, it doesn’t mean he’s not a repulsive embarrassment to the entire human race.&lt;/p&gt;

This would have effectively opened the door for just about anyone to create an equally bogus institution in Texas and award people with worthless degrees.I figured it was sort of a win-win situation since had the measure passed, I could then make a living selling Doctorates and Masters Degrees in all fields for the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:N80zN_XSpaFViM:http://inspectorgadgetfans.com/files/2008/12/claw_inspector_gadget-300x222.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:N80zN_XSpaFViM:http://inspectorgadgetfans.com/files/2008/12/claw_inspector_gadget-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="86"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/creationists_vs_texas.php"&gt;Well the creationists’ plot failed&lt;/a&gt; as the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board basically told them to go fuck themselves. Way to go, Texas! But that battle ended with the creationsts declaring, “I’ll get you next time, Gadget!” while pounding their evil metal fist on their desk. And unfortunately next time has come very soon as the Institute for Creation Research is now suing the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as 1 blogger reports, the lawsuit seems to only make them look like even bigger fools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sixty-seven-page complaint teems with various factual claims and legal arguments, leading a blogger for the Dallas Observer (April 20, 2009) to quip that it “reads kind of like stereo instructions.” It also teems with unabashed creationist rhetoric, citing articles from the ICR’s publication Acts and Facts along with case law, explaining that Paredes — born as he was in 1942 — was not a witness to the Big Bang, asserting that discussions about the origin of life and the formation of the earth “do not become ‘empirical science’ simply because those discussions emit from the oral cavities of ’scientists’” (p. 33), and insisting that the Big Bang “should not be confused with the ‘great noise’ mentioned in 2nd Peter 3:10″ (p. 21).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I will give them some credit. This will make a great lesson in wise decision-making for the school to see if they can be wise enough to throw these vampires out on their asses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;a href="http://projects.latimes.com/schools/school/van-nuys/kester-avenue-elementary/"&gt;Kester Avenue Elementary&lt;/a&gt; has failed as this crap is actually being taught there. But the parents in the district get a passing grade for protesting it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is drawing fire from parents and others who say it is illegally bringing religion into public schools under the guise of ethics training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it breaches the separation between church and state,” said Margie Mulder, a guidance counselor at &lt;a href="http://projects.latimes.com/schools/school/los-angeles/utah-street-elementary/"&gt;Utah Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://projects.latimes.com/schools/school/north-hills/noble-avenue-elementary/"&gt;Noble Avenue&lt;/a&gt; elementary schools. “I wouldn’t send my children to the group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others say it provides children with essential skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” ‘Spirituality for Kids’ is not religious,” said Karen Timko, who is in charge of elementary counselors for the Los Angeles Unified School District and has included the group in a resource fair for counselors. “It’s tools for navigating your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center’s website says it offers a nonreligious “way of creating a better life,” and that if students work to become more sharing, caring and tolerant, they will experience previously unknown fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tools for navigating your life?” “Way of creating a better life?” “Unknown fulfillmnet?” Where’d they pick those lines up? The $cientology Center?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this shit is everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is offered in schools and community centers around the globe, from New York and Florida to Mexico and Malawi. Since 2006, nearly 4,400 Los Angeles children have taken part. Its use in London schools has generated controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirituality for Kids Foundation, which runs the program, listed nearly $18 million in assets on IRS disclosure forms for 2007, the most recent available. Celebrity kabbalah devotees, including Madonna, are among its funders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they’ve found a crack in the wall between church and state that allows this to continue, at least for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public school students cannot legally be subject to proselytizing, although religious groups are allowed to sponsor school programming as long as it does not favor one faith. But programs linked to groups outside the mainstream often come under scrutiny. Others that have drawn fire include “study technology,” a learning method created by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and Transcendental Meditation offered by the David Lynch Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “kabbalah” was not mentioned in the Kester class, but its presence seemed unmistakable. Zucker and a facilitator wore red knotted strings — frequently used by kabbalah practitioners to ward off the evil eye — around their left wrists. They also used terms — such as “light” and “the opponent” — that are found throughout the L.A. center’s website and its IRS filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not enough schools encourage their students to wear cloves of garlic and carry wooden stakes to keep these types out of the schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I never could stand about Los Angeles is all the damned vampires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Keeping warm isn't the only reason lizards and other cold-blooded critters bask in the sun.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research spearheaded by the University of York has used computer models to explain the evolution of the distinctive colouring of many species of wildlife.

Satan is religious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. Satan believes in God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. Satan believes in Jesus (Since salvation is based on faith alone (Protestant); then Satan has salvation). &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D. Satan believes in all the doctrines that make up soteriology in the Bible since he is portrayed as working against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E. Satan is a good friend of God: 1. In the Book of Job, Satan and God were betting buddies who made life Hell for poor ole faithful Job. 2. In Numbers 22, Satan is one of God messenger angles and he acts in accordance with Yahweh‘s will. (Check out the Hebrew here!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;F. The fact that Jesus stated that those who love him do the will of his father (God), than Satan proved that he also loved Jesus as he did the will of God as stated above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;G. Satan has more morals than God himself as Satan has never murdered defenseless men, women children, babies and the unborn as God did in the Hebrew Bible. Now, compared to God, Satan has been an angle of love (Note the objection to Revelation below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;H. Satan has a code of morals and ethics and abides by them as seen in the temptation of Jesus (unlike the murderous Israelite god Yahweh, Satan values life).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I. Satan is willing to be God’s “whipping boy” to allow Jesus to look good. But we should note! Satan has never said he was the leader of the demons. Demons are Gods own creations to affect fallen humanity after their expulsion from Eden and are God’s eternal curse on them. (In the New Testament, the term Devil can mean demons (Mark 1:34, 3:22; Matt. 9:34, 12:24; Luke 8:2, 9:1, 11:15; 1 Tim. 4:1; James 2:19) as well as Satan (Matt. 4:5, 8:11; Luke 4:2,3, 13; John 13:2, 8:44; James 4:7 and so on).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J. The Book of Revelation is a late addition to the Canon objected to as heretical by a number of the Church Fathers and Luther.(&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;) Fact is, the Book of Revelation late creation (post 90CE) is simply revisionist theology written to shift all God’s historical faults onto Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;K. Since Satan can not create anything; the problems imposed by Hell, the Lake of Fire, the Pit&lt;br&gt;(Rev. 9: 1,2 ) as depicted in Revelation from which stinging the demons come forth (Rev. 9:10), the Beast and the false prophet are all Gods creations and was one reason Revelation was considered heretical which contributed to its late inclusion in the New Testament Canon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, the woes in the Book of Revelation are God’s own doing to make him look like a Deity in control (Like the deranged fireman who starts a fire so he can get the glory of being the first on the scene to put it out). In this sense, the self destructive God of Revelation is the same self destructive God in the book of Job who gloried in Job’s suffering to make himself look great!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L. Satan was never hated for what he preached unlike Jesus whose so-called ministry of love went from zero to death in three years or less! The statement that Jesus himself said: “By their fruits you will know them.” Matt. 7:16 - 20 by which Satan’s actions are vindicated while Jesus’ actions definitely are not (Jesus was the “tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire”/ crucified). It’s funny how a man like Jesus, who is said to have loved all of humanity, ended up hated and killed by the end results of his own so called love (Talk about a moral and ethical contradiction)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;M. Jesus believed in and trusted Satan so much that during all three temptations, Jesus followed Satan for 40 days (Mark 1: 13, Luke 4:2) and enjoyed Satan’s preaching (if he did not, why did he hang out with him for 40 days?). In the end, Jesus was as faithful to Satan as Jesus’ own disciples were to him in that Jesus abandon Satan just as the Disciples were to later abandon Jesus: A time when they were needed the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;N. While Satan is called a “Liar and the father of all lies” the Bible fails to give not one single incident of Satan lying. Even the serpent in the Garden of Eden is depicted as stating the truth while Yahweh lied (The very day you eat of it, you shall die). This serpent in the Garden of Eden has more in common with the medical rod of Asclepius noted for wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P. Since Satan is a fallen angel, the atoning death of Jesus only benefits fallen humanity and not the spirit world, so just as the Church Father Origen’s belief in universal salvation implied Satan will be given salvation at the last judgment just as all Christians (Commentary on John 32.229f.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q. Satan did not create this Fallen World outside the Garden of Eden, God did. Just as God created the woes in the Book of Revelation to sadistically extract prayers and praises for himself, God created the Fallen World to sadistically billed himself up and extract prayers and praises for himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R. Sure, God gave his only son to die for a mess God himself created just like God created Satan as his escape goat to blame for his evil side. God uses others to carry the blame for his screw ups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S. If one was to take the Bible and list all the evil deeds God has done compared to those deeds of Satan, the evil deeds of God recorded in his own word, the Bible, would over whelm any so-called evil deeds of Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T. Finally, since the Bible lists the acts of God as a witness to his many evil and sadistic deeds, by such a Biblical witness, Satan is indeed a Christian!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;) The Book, which was probably known to Papias is already ascribed by Justin to the Apostle John. This attribution was accepted in the Muratorian Canon and by Tertullian and Hippolytus and generally followed in the west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the East it was widely rejected, most notably by Alogi, Dionysius of Alexandria (who argued against its Apostolic authorship on the ground that it differs in style and content from the Fourth Gospel and believed it to be the work of some other John). It was also rejected by Eusebius. Some Eastern Church Fathers and Councils (Cyril of Jerusalem, the Council of Laodicea, john Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia0 did not include it in the Canon. It was also omitted originally from the Syriac Peshitta and the Armenian versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Further discussions on the theology and canonical status of this Book can be found in the commentaries of R.H Charles (2 vols. in the ICC), David Aune’s 3 vols. in The World Biblical Commentary or Bruce Metzger’s The Canonization of the New Testament)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6305629644883051985?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Fortunately, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board flatly turned them down, one of the smart moves in which Texas can take some pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/04/icr-sues-thecb-004745"&gt;ICR is now suing the THECB&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously. Even better, the lawsuit is a dense compendium of concentrated hilarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixty-seven-page complaint teems with various factual claims and legal arguments, leading a blogger for the Dallas Observer (April 20, 2009) to quip that it &amp;quot;reads kind of like stereo instructions.&amp;quot; It also teems with unabashed creationist rhetoric, citing articles from the ICR&amp;#39;s publication Acts and Facts along with case law, explaining that Paredes — born as he was in 1942 — was not a witness to the Big Bang, asserting that discussions about the origin of life and the formation of the earth &amp;quot;do not become &amp;#39;empirical science&amp;#39; simply because those discussions emit from the oral cavities of &amp;#39;scientists&amp;#39;&amp;quot; (p. 33), and insisting that the Big Bang &amp;quot;should not be confused with the &amp;#39;great noise&amp;#39; mentioned in 2nd Peter 3:10&amp;quot; (p. 21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it heartwarming that the creationists are once again demonstrating their profound legal acumen on top of their mastery of logic and science. Those of you who find &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/creationism/legal/institute-creation-research-graduate-school-v-paredes-et-al"&gt;amusement in outré and hysterical legal documents&lt;/a&gt; can read the whole of the complaint online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/creationists_vs_texas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UfoKofzTjRg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry></feed>
