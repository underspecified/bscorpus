But we’re getting there.  It’s sometimes hard to see the forest for the trees, but the longer-term trends are pretty unambiguous.  (Which is not to say it’s impossible they will someday reverse course.)  I suspect that, hand-wringing about arrogance and “fundamentalist atheists” notwithstanding, the exhortations of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/02/14/thank-you-richard-dawkins/"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; and his ilk have had something to do with it.  If nothing else, they provide clear examples of people who think it’s perfectly okay to not believe in God, and be proud of it.  That’s not an insignificant factor.  It’s most likely a small perturbation on top of more significant long-term cultural trends, but it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/192583"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; reports the facts&lt;/a&gt;:  the number of self-identified Christians in the U.S. has fallen by 10 points over the last twenty years, from 86 to 76 percent.  The number of people who are unaffiliated with any religion has jumped forward, from 5 percent in 1988 to 12 percent today.  And the number who are willing to label themselves “atheists” has, it’s reasonable to say, skyrocketed — from 1 million in 1990 to 3.6 million today.  That’s still less than two percent of the population, so let’s not get carried away.  But it’s double the number of Episcopalians!  (I was raised as an Episcopalian.  Always been a shameless front-runner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how Jon Meacham sums it up in &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There it was, an old term with new urgency: &lt;em&gt;post-Christian&lt;/em&gt;. This is not to say that the Christian God is dead, but that he is less of a force in American politics and culture than at any other time in recent memory. To the surprise of liberals who fear the advent of an evangelical theocracy and to the dismay of religious conservatives who long to see their faith more fully expressed in public life, Christians are now making up a declining percentage of the American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before, but it’s time for us atheists to diversify our portfolio, as far as popular culture is concerned — skepticism and mocking of creationists are all well and good, but we need to put forward a positive agenda for living our lives without the comforting untruths handed down by religion.  I’m doing my part by joining the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Epicurus/79493658728"&gt;Epicurus fan page on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The state of being wrong at every conceivable scale of resolution. That is, from a distance, a fractally wrong person&amp;#39;s worldview is incorrect; and furthermore, if you zoom in on any small part of that person&amp;#39;s worldview, that part is just as wrong as the whole worldview.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The phrase was coined by Keunwoo Lee.  I learned it from Codeman38 at &lt;a href="http://aut.zone38.net/"&gt;Normal is Overrated&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to refer to &lt;a href="http://aut.zone38.net/2009/04/04/mr-handley-were-standing-right-here/"&gt;J.B. Handley&amp;#39;s spewings on Larry King&amp;#39;s show&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph at Natural Variation wants to know: &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/jb-handley-poorly-informed-or-outright.html"&gt;JB Handley - Poorly Informed or Outright Liar? &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that JB Handley is either completely misinformed about some basic facts having to do with autism epidemiology, or he decided to go on Larry King to simply lie with a straight face.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
April Fools of the month on Larry King tonight: Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, Jerry Kartzinel and JB. Handley (of Generation Rescue) — yet again in the “name of autism” or to “wage a war” on it as it were, are STILL purporting their vaccine hypothesis — which, really, is no longer deserving of being in that category, since it has been disproven over and over again. The “bulking” of vaccines or the “schedule” — all of it — are, according to science, not the cause of autism. Yet science doesn’t seem to matter in all of this. People do not matter in all of this. Not the people who matter, anyway. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should have seen it coming. April is Autism Awareness month, and since I first discovered the issue I noticed that the antivaccine movement always cranks up the crazy in April. Always.

From NCD chairperson John R. Vaughn,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The report focuses on the current quality of life of people with disabilities in America and the emerging trends that should be factored into both the design and evaluation of the Federal Government's disability policies and programs in the coming years. Strides have been made in access to transportation, education, communications, technology, and employment. Other factors important to quality of life, however, impede progress toward full citizenship, such as lack of affordable, accessible housing, difficulty breaking into the job market, poor access to health care, the institutional bias in Medicaid, access barriers to technology, and negative public attitudes about people with disabilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 102 pages, it's going to take me a while to get through more than the executive summary (though I suspect taking the time to read through the whole thing will be worth it).  One piece of the executive summary stuck out to me immediately though, probably because it's at the core of most of the serious difficulties I face right now in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many instances, improvements in quality of life for people with disabilities can be attributed to government programs, particularly those involving intergovernmental partnerships as well as partnerships with the private and volunteer sectors. Examples from the livable communities' model demonstrate the potential for such partnerships to improve life for all citizens--people with disabilities and aging baby boomers, in particular.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, many of the intractable problems for people with disabilities can be attributed to government programs and policies. Research reveals program fragmentation, lack of coordination, government policies that conflict with one another, and counterproductive eligibility and benefits restrictions. Certain government policies actually have the effect of forcing people to live in institutions, prevent people from working, and impede achievement of the overarching goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I've written about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/money_alone_is_not_enough_for_successful_services"&gt;some issues besides funding&lt;/a&gt; to consider regarding government programs.  Don't mistake my posting of policy-related items to this blog to mean I personally believe financial support of these items alone is key to a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the seven page, 17 item long "recommendations" section in the &lt;a href="http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/news/2009/r09-581.htm"&gt;progress report's&lt;/a&gt; executive summary attests, there is a long, complex path ahead to figure out how U.S. government programs and policy can truly improve quality of life for disabled citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238948108866"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1296">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bf6f6b01aef9f37</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><category term="Morphology"/><title type="html">Scuba dove?</title><published>2009-04-05T16:07:12Z</published><updated>2009-04-05T16:07:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1296" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the annals of (two-part) back-formed verbs and irregularization, a &lt;em&gt;Sheldon&lt;/em&gt; cartoon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to Greg Poulos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've posted here on two-part back-formed verbs at least twice: on the verb &lt;em&gt;gay marry&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=519"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and on the verbs &lt;em&gt;early/absentee/advance vote&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=795"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These are recent back-formations, but some examples are older; here are some 19th-century examples (the dates are the earliest in my sources, not necessarily the dates of actual first uses):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;housekeep&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;housekeeper&lt;/em&gt; (1842); &lt;em&gt;houseclean&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;housecleaning&lt;/em&gt; (1863); &lt;em&gt;cross-refer&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;cross-reference&lt;/em&gt; (1879); &lt;em&gt;hard-boil&lt;/em&gt; [an egg], from &lt;em&gt;hard-boiled&lt;/em&gt; (1895)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have quite a collection of such cases, over 70 of them, arranged alphabetically by the verb in second position (from ASSOCIATE, with &lt;em&gt;free-associate&lt;/em&gt;, to WRITE, with &lt;em&gt;hand-write&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;typewrite&lt;/em&gt;). Neal Whitman has written on these back-formations several times on his Literal Minded &lt;a href="http://literalminded.wordpress.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;; there's a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_back-formations"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; (which mixes this type of back-formation in with simpler verb cases, like &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt;, and noun cases, like &lt;em&gt;kudo&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;kudos&lt;/em&gt;); and there have been quite a few postings to the &lt;a href="http://www.americandialect.org"&gt;American Dialect Society&lt;/a&gt; mailing list on them. Some of the many examples discussed on ADS-L:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;executive produce&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;buddy work&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;showrun&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;line-jump&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;doctor-shop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;store-buy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;grudge-hold&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;secret-spend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets us the verb &lt;em&gt;scuba dive&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;2 has the noun &lt;em&gt;scuba&lt;/em&gt; (originally &lt;em&gt;SCUBA&lt;/em&gt;) from 1952, then &lt;em&gt;scuba-diving&lt;/em&gt; in 1977, and the verb &lt;em&gt;scuba dive&lt;/em&gt; in 1980.) But what is its past tense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, it turns out, is really a question about the verb &lt;em&gt;dive&lt;/em&gt; in general, not just in &lt;em&gt;scuba dive&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;MWDEU&lt;/em&gt; has a fairly long entry for &lt;em&gt;dove&lt;/em&gt;, which notes that historically it was a "weak verb", with past tense &lt;em&gt;dived&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DARE&lt;/em&gt; records "old-fashioned" &lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt; as well, uninflected past &lt;em&gt;dive&lt;/em&gt; for some black speakers, and occasional occurrences of &lt;em&gt;diven&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;doved&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;duv&lt;/em&gt;). The variant &lt;em&gt;dove&lt;/em&gt; developed in the 19th century, presumably by analogy with &lt;em&gt;drove&lt;/em&gt;, and then spread, especially in the northern U.S. and some parts of Canada. After noting that the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; was long dead-set against &lt;em&gt;dove&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MWDEU&lt;/em&gt; concludes (p. 370):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;dived&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat more common in writing in the U.S. and is usual in British English, &lt;em&gt;dove&lt;/em&gt; is an acceptable variant. We suggest that you use whichever is more natural to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainingly, there is a two-part back-formed verb &lt;em&gt;muff dive&lt;/em&gt; 'perform oral sex on a female, give head to a female', already in my list of back-formations (under DIVE), and, yes, it can have a past tense &lt;em&gt;muff dove&lt;/em&gt;; see this &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080606170110AATlG4Q"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; on Yahoo! Answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is past tense for the term "cunnilingus"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[original question] The past tense for fellate (the act of performing fellatio) is fellated. Is there a corresponding term for cunnilingus? … Okay, it&amp;#39;s a noun. Is there a corresponding verb to the term &amp;quot;fellate&amp;quot;? That is, a one-word term, not a phrase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[respondent] Can't think of a one word answer, but how about "muff dove" or "ate out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238943599353"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/05/sundanity/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2ffb0a4c85f60626</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">Sundanity</title><published>2009-04-05T14:43:59Z</published><updated>2009-04-05T14:43:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/05/sundanity/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/apr/04/nasa-spacer-agency-chief-obama"&gt;The Guardian has a nice little article on the future of NASA&lt;/a&gt;, including a quote by a guy you may know. &lt;/p&gt;

In my experience it is a trait rarely seen in working scientists, but often accused as a way of dismissing scientific criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent editorial in the &lt;a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/Life/Scientism+infects+Darwinian+debates/1464023/story.html"&gt;Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt; (sent to me by listener Vinay Punwani) by Doublas Todd misinterprets scientism all together to create a straw man argument against defenders of evolution. Todd writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who unknowingly fall into the trap of scientism act as if hard science is the only way of knowing reality. If something can’t be “proved” through the scientific method, through observable and measurable evidence, they say it’s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientism is terribly limiting of human understanding. It leaves little or no place for the insights of the arts, philosophy, psychology, literature, mythology, dreams, music, the emotions or spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd has made the logical fallacy of assuming the inverse of scientism as an extension of the definition. In other words - scientism is the belief that science will discover all knowledge, the inverse of scientism is that something that is not science cannot discover any knowledge. So Todd is attacking the inverse of scientism, not scientism itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd makes a far more egregious mistake in not properly defining “understanding.” This is a very vague term - using ambiguous terminology and then exploiting that ambiguity to create a misconception is a common tactic of debate, but is fallacious reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we try to define terms precisely, Todd’s argument evaporates. What scientists argue is that the methods of science are the only way to generate scientific knowledge of the universe. Yes - that statement is self-referential, because science is a system and only claims knowledge within its system. Science does not claim objective ultimate metaphysical truth of reality - only that: 1) its methods, when properly employed, give results that are internally consistent, 2) these results are useful and powerful because they make predictions about how the world will behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights from the arts, literature, mytholody, dreams, music are legitimate for what they are - they are just not science. Philosophy is different, because part of philosophy is logic, which is a necessary tool of science. Psychology is a scientific discipline, so its inclusion in the list is not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd argues that scientists feel insights from these other disciplines are “irrelevant” - but he misses the point, that they are irrelevant &lt;em&gt;to science&lt;/em&gt;. Science is a collection of methods to empirically test ideas about how the world works through observation and experimentation. Other intellectual activity, like aesthetics and value judgments, are simply not part of science, even though they may provide other kinds of insights and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd’s argument is therefore a mess of confused definitions and logic. But it gets worse. He also writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, scientism leaves little or no place for the imagination, which Albert Einstein, after all, said is “everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? Imagination is a very important part of science. Excluding non-scientific intellectual activity from science (which is appropriate and necessary) is no scientism, and doing so does not eject imagination from the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He develops his fallacious arguments specifically to apply to evolution. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Walden, whose viewpoint represents that of many scientists, appears to believe that any discussion of evolution that does not uphold chance as the only driving force is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is blinkered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It defaults to atheism. And it assumes incorrectly that what we believe, and the way we live, is always based on provable “facts,” which do not include conjecture, speculation or imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we see why Todd set up his bizarre position about science and scientism - it get’s back to the old intelligent design claim that “Darwinism” is atheism, because it will not consider anything other than chance as a mechanism. What rubbish. Todd is further trying to argue this is equivalent to ejecting “conjecture, speculation, or imagination” from science, which is bizarre and ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd is also making the common straw man argument that rejecting a proposition based upon logic and evidence is equivalent to rejecting it out of hand, or clinging dogmatically to the current consensus. Scientists will consider any proposition which is coherent. Rejecting a proposition based upon the current evidence, or on logical grounds, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to purpose in evolution - this is the old ID tactic of arguing that evolutionists will not consider purpose because evolution is inherently atheistic. Wrong and wrong. Science and evolution are not atheistic - science is agnostic toward any proposition which is outside the realm of science. If an idea cannot be tested scientifically, it is not science, and science is agnostic toward it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge to those who believe there is some purpose or direction in the mechanisms of evolution is to develop a coherent and testable scientific theory. So far, no one has been able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is not as if scientists assume evolution is random. In fact, early ideas of evolution is that it was directional and purposeful. Observation of the natural world led to the conclusion that evolutionary change results only in adapation to the local environment. There is no data to suggest that there is any direction or purpose to evolutionary change. There is no known mechanism by which such purpose would exist. Mutations and recombination appear to be random. Variation and natural selection, as a theory for the mechanism of evolution, are doing just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd brings up Lynn Margulis as a scientist with an alternate view of evolution that includes purpose. But I think he is misintepreting her work - although this is a topic for another post. And, in any case, this would just contradict Todd’s point - if Margulis has an alternate theory of the mechanism and mode of evolution then great. It is up to her to formulate her theory is a testable way, then scientific methods can be used to see if it has any merit. If it does, and the evidence supports her view, it will win out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end Todd’s article is one long and fallacious argument for admitting non-scientific arguments into science. This is, of course, exactly what Intelligent Design proponents want to do. Their ideas have lost the battle within science long ago, so now they are trying to change the rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238933843763"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1743760356035908817">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/51e51f7950e0f85f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">William Lane Craig &amp;quot;Won by a Landslide&amp;quot; Against Hitchens</title><published>2009-04-07T03:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-07T12:49:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/juarT3TvX6M/william-lane-craig-won-by-landslide.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1743760356035908817/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1743760356035908817" title="50 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/william-lane-craig-won-by-landslide.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">That's what Roger Sharp said on &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; after watching the debate in person.

On Thursday, 150 empty strollers were placed in Central Park to "&lt;a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/health/tips_info/150-Empty-Strollers-Drive-Home-Impact-of-Autism.html"&gt;drive home [the] impact of autism&lt;/a&gt;."  A potent symbol, 150 empty strollers in a world-famous park where plenty of well-heeled parents walk (or jog, or run) with their children---and a symbol that, knowingly or not, sums up the state of understanding of autism and of individuals on the autism spectrum. Empty strollers suggest that (1) the children missing would be small enough to fit in those strollers and (2) children who're on the autism spectrum are, indeed, "missing" children and have been "taken away" or---reminiscent of the 2007 "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/kidnapped-by-autism-making-noise-about-ransom-notes/"&gt;Ransom Notes&lt;/a&gt;" ad campaign---"kidnapped" by autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Ransom Notes" campaign was &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/provocative-harsh-upsetting-the-ransom-notes-ad-campaign/"&gt;roundly critiqued&lt;/a&gt; by self-advocates, parents of children on the spectrum, and many others. But it's the strollers in particular that are revealing---strollers are, of course, for use by &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; children. Autism is currently most often thought of as a disability in children, and much of the focus on treatment, programs, etc. is primarily on children. As writer Linda H. Davis---her son Randy is 22---wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/03/AR2009040303169.html?hpid=opinionsbox1"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; editorial yesterday, "autistic adults are relegated to the sidelines." The number of children estimated to need "extensive adult services by 2023" totals 380,000, a figure which "roughly equal to the population of Minneapolis" according to Davis, who especially highlights the need for trained workers to support adults who require such services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy is just one of hundreds of thousands of autistic adults to whom society pays frighteningly little attention. The price of their care will affect all Americans, not only those who have autistic children. Along with housing, day programs, transportation to those programs or jobs, and higher-than-average medical costs, adults with autism require steady supervision and support. Consider: A well-behaved, relatively high-functioning person such as my son could manage in an environment that has a ratio of three clients per staff member. But many autistic people require a one-to-one ratio. This is a serious hurdle, not least because of the high turnover rate among those who provide direct care, which stems in part from their low wages. Not everyone is temperamentally suited to this work. People with autism present myriad challenges: They can sometimes be violent, sometimes are self-abusive, suffer psychological meltdowns, or behave in many socially unacceptable ways, to say the least. Women, traditionally cast in the caregiver role, are at risk of greater physical harm when caring for autistic adults than for children. At expected rates, we will need to find an additional million caregivers, people who must have the right personal qualities to work with autistic individuals but who are willing and able to work for low wages. This is no small challenge. We not only must train people but also show that we value this work by paying them better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's too true: So much of how well my son does is based very much on the teachers and other individuals around him. His teacher this year has been beyond wonderful (though I think I might be driving her crazy lately with my queryings) and I don't know where we all would be without her. There aren't many like her, and Jim and I just hope that we are able to convey our gratefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's worry, though. She'll only be Charlie's teacher for a short while and hopefully next year. Not everyone is willing, and able, to work with Charlie now that's he older, tall as many of his aides and therapists, and athletic, and strong. Charlie's far from being an adult----he'll be 12 in the middle of May---but already a great deal has changed in how people respond to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point was driven home to me on Saturday afternoon when Charlie and I went to swim at the YMCA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The YMCA in our town is a very big operation and encompasses not only the main facility (where some previous difficulties with &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/hes-a-really-good-swimmer-really/"&gt;pool access&lt;/a&gt; have occurred), but a couple of satellite locations. One of the latter---our favorite pool to swim in---is actually located in the facilities of a large autism center; the YMCA (I think) rents the space. The pool is huge and heated and there are windows that let in light and offer a view of trees. Charlie always seems at ease in the big space and gets in some good swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. It's been made to clear to us by the front desk that, at the times we're swimming at the pool (and Jim is using the workout equipment upstairs), that &lt;em&gt;It is the YMCA and not an autism school&lt;/em&gt;.  Ok, ok----Jim and I still call this particular YMCA branch by its autism school name; you can't avoid seeing the yellow school buses and the signs when you drive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only drawback to swimming at this "YMCA branch"  is that, while there are very nice locker rooms for men and for women, there is no "family" changing room. Boys over seven or so are not allowed in the women's locker rooms. This is not a problem when we're with Jim, but it is when it's Charlie and me. Charlie's just not ready to go into the men's locker room by himself and, when it's just him and me, we have to ask the front desk to open a side door for us. After swimming, we walk up three flights of stairs to change in a restroom (reasonable large, for individuals with disabilities). I've made a number of inquiries about me taking Charlie into the women's locker room and gotten a "no" every time. Much as I think Charlie is aware of everything, I do note to the front desk that he's not very inclined to look at other people, and I'd really prefer that he not have to walk around the building in a wet suit, with no possibility of a shower after he's swam on a cold day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diner_date"&gt;Jim out of town&lt;/a&gt;, it was Charlie and me. Maybe because I, in the final stages of recovering from a cold, coughed just as I parked the car, or maybe because we usually don't go to the YMCA on Saturday and because Jim was not with us: Charlie got really, briefly, upset and I wasn't sure if we'd be able to swim. We got ourselves into the building and----Charlie had yet to put on his swimsuit---I asked if we could just go quickly into the women's locker room, so Charlie could change, as it was one of those moments when the ordinary (walking up the three flights of stairs to change in the restroom) seemeddaunting and potentially disastrous, with an unhappy boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was no, repeated a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the following back-and-forth I noted that the building &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an autism school and was told that right now, it was the YMCA. The upshot was that, with a female staff member, we were "allowed" to go into the women's locker room and Charlie quickly changed and we were soon in the pool where we behelf six lifeguards and one person swimming laps. (Meaning that, the locker room had been empty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Charlie grinned and jumped into the pool, I reaccessed what I had said. Of course I've long known that Charlie, once older, would not be allowed in a women's locker room, Sure I wish that he could go into the men's locker room and change, but there's some significant safety issues to consider. I doubt the YMCA could change its policy about who's allowed in which dressing room, and yet I have to wonder if any accommodations might be possible. And, rather than denying that this particular YMCA branch is located in part of an autism school, why not use this as a way to consider new possibilities, new models and strategies for accommodations, new opportunities for thinking how to make the world accessible for individuals with disabilities of all sorts and needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our YMCA does have some "special programs" for kids on the spectrum, including swimming lessons and a biweekly Saturday session of swimming and gymnastics in which kids on the spectrum are paired with teenage volunteers. Both of these programs are geared more for children younger than Charlie; he used to really enjoy the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_not_swimming_alone"&gt;Saturday sessions&lt;/a&gt;, but things have changed now that he's older, and still has a lot of needs. It's not special programs that Charlie needs at the YMCA, but ways to integrate him into what most people use the YMCA for. And that does mean, making it possible for him to do the basics---showering and dressing---in ways that don't place extra demands on him, and single him out his difference. Indeed, as Charlie's grown older, places at the YMCA are potentially much more important, as they give him a place to learn leisure activities, socialize (in his way), and much more----the kinds of things he needs to learn to help him through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long time ago Jim and I put away Charlie's stroller and actually not long after he learned to walk. Guess we knew even then that he'd have to get himself places on his own two feet---not that we've ever been so far away that we couldn't reach out and hold his hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238915437136"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-7085908364275904334">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d7ecafe9c4e356c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Bigfoot's Basketball!</title><published>2009-04-05T06:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-05T06:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/04/bigfoots-basketball.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">While looking through my stupid, &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/02/calling-all-readers.html"&gt;uneditable&lt;/a&gt; sasquatch hunt footage, I found the one and only picture we actually took &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/03/bigfoot-chasing.html"&gt;that weekend&lt;/a&gt;, to record the auspicious occasion of finding clear evidence of Bigfoot recreation in the hills of rural southern Indiana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below the fold is Bigfoot's basketball, held in the capable hands of my good friend Eib. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click to embiggen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SdhWXSNQmXI/AAAAAAAAAik/g7FQqWS9yCw/s1600-h/Bigfoot+Hunt+040.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:240px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SdhWXSNQmXI/AAAAAAAAAik/g7FQqWS9yCw/s320/Bigfoot+Hunt+040.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Proof, ladies and gentlemen, that Bigfoot is intelligent enough to exploit his height for recreational purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-7085908364275904334?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238914884864"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4000164429523254984">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84010424fea15d54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Is the Bible Ever Wrong?

In January, they staged &lt;a href="http://improveverywhere.com/2009/01/14/no-pants-2k9/"&gt;their annual No Pants Day&lt;/a&gt;, where literally thousands of New Yorkers got onto and rode subways with no pants. Of course they had underwear on, but just no pants. And they were told that if anyone asked about it to just act nonchalant as if they didn’t even notice they hadn’t been wearing pants until it was brought to their attention and are entirely apathetic about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://improveverywhere.com/2009/04/02/april-fool-funeral/"&gt;Well on April Fools Day, they pulled another outrageous prank, a bogus funeral that they were commited to making “awesome.”&lt;/a&gt; You can see video of the prank on their site &lt;a href="http://improveverywhere.com/2009/04/01/best-funeral-ever/#comments"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately a local news team who didn’t bother to do any investigation at all, incorrectly mistook this as being a prank on actual unsuspecting funeral attendees when in actuality, the joke was on them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/when-the-news-doesnt-bother-to-do-even-the-slightest-bit-of-investigating/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pvOvlmT4Oi0/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic! I might have to join these guys some time on a future event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s some of their last stunts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/when-the-news-doesnt-bother-to-do-even-the-slightest-bit-of-investigating/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Q6NU5K3k8Xo/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, this really is performance art at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghan President Hamid Karzai has just signed a law that forces women to obey their husbands’ sexual demands, keeps women from leaving the house — even for work or school — without a husband’s permission, automatically grants child custody rights to fathers and grandfathers before mothers, and favors men in inheritance disputes and other legal matters. In short, the law again consigns Afghan women to lives of brutal repression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6025362.ece"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times Online&lt;/em&gt; (UK)&lt;/a&gt;, the law was “passed without a formal debate and signed off by President Karzai this week, but is yet to be made law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the details of the law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 27&lt;/strong&gt; The age of maturity (and thus marriage) is 15 for boys; for girls it is when they have their first period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 132&lt;/strong&gt; The couple should not commit acts that create hatred and bitterness. The wife is bound to preen for her husband, as and when he desires. &lt;strong&gt;The husband, except when travelling or ill, is bound to have intercourse with his wife every four nights. The wife is bound to give a positive response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 133&lt;/strong&gt; The husband can stop the wife from any unnecessary, un-Islamic act. &lt;strong&gt;The wife cannot leave the house without the permission of the husband&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 177&lt;/strong&gt; The wife does not have the right to the provision of maintenance by the husband unless she agrees to have intercourse with him and he gets an opportunity for doing so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Obedience, readiness for intercourse and not leaving the house without the permission of the husband are the duties of the wife, violation of every one of them will mean disobedience to the husband&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— One provision of the law appears to protect the woman’s right to sex inside marriage, saying that the “man should not avoid having sexual relations with his wife longer than once every four months”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, this is a canard, given that science, including science-based medicine, thrives on the open and free exchange of ideas, and it is not “close-mindedness” that (usually) leads to the rejection of dubious claims. Rather, it is the knowledge that, for many of such claims to be true, huge swaths of our current scientific understanding would have to be in error to such an extent that a major paradigm shift in various basic science would be necessary. While such paradigm shifts occasionally occur, they do not occur without the confluence of huge amounts of evidence, often coming from different fields and directions. In other words, to show that a paradigm is wrong or seriously incomplete requires evidence even more compelling than the evidence supporting the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video, via &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2009/04/pseudoscience_and_its_flawed_m.php"&gt;The World’s Fair&lt;/a&gt;, explains why when woo-meisters wrap themselves in the mantle of “open-mindedness” it’s almost always a crock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/T69TOuqaqXI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have to keep this video around for my medical students to help them counter the inevitable charge of “close-mindedness” by CAM advocates. In fact, the part at the end, with the blond guy letting all sorts of rubbish into his brain because he has no critical thinking filter while demanding that others accept his views without evidence reminds me very much of a male version of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=439"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, full of the arrogance of ignorance. If the cartoon weren’t of such a good-looking young man, I’d say it was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;, although the video does get the cartoonishness right.&lt;/p&gt;

You can read the letter from a nursing faculty member to the student &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36800888@N02/sets/72157615921627243/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nioska, I’ve been thinking about the meeting in rita’s office and I feel that maybe Nursing is the wrong career for you. As a nurse, I have to advocate for my patients, and i feel that female patients will be uncomfortable having a lesbian nurse caring for them. You do not provide a sense of security to patients when you keep important information from them. Your sexual orientation is something important that patients have a right to know so that they can decide if they wish to have you as their caregiver. I myself am not homophobic at all, but I would not want a lesbian nurse caring for me when I am vulnerable. I would just not feel comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it might be best if you see student services to explore other career options that do not involve physical interaction, and intimacy. It wuold look better if you left nursing out of your own accord, rather than get kicked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am just being honest. at the beginning of the rotation you asked me to be honest in my feedback, and i am doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tassy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if I’m seeking medical attention I don’t very much give a shit &lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3265380790_68a75c579d_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3265380790_68a75c579d_m.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;what my attending nurse’s sexual orientation is unless she’s hot, which could also cause an uncomfortable situation. Though I wouldn’t recommend rejecting a nurse because she was too hot either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, why the fuck would a nurse’s sexual orientation even come up in a conversation with a patient in the first place? Again, barring her being hot, in which case, all rules of decorum may be abandoned. But seriously though, “Your sexual orientation is something important that patients have a right to know so that they can decide if they wish to have you as their caregiver.” What?! No they don’t? Patients most definitely do not have the right to know their attending nurse’s sexual orientation! What crazy-ass hospital has Tassy worked for? If I’m a patient at a hospital, it’s none of my damned business what my attending nurse’s sexual orientation, whether he or she is heterosexual or homosexual. Seriously, what the fuck?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third of all, “I myself am not homophobic at all, but I would not want a lesbian nurse caring for me when I am vulnerable. I would just not feel comfortable with that.” Wow! It’s been awhile since I’ve seen just internal inconsistency in a single sentence. It’s almost like the person saying the second half of that sentence was oblivious to the first half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth of all, even if a homophobic patient did have an objection to having a lesbian nurse, and let’s say he’s rich enough that the hospital doesn’t want to tell them to get over it because that’s his nurse whether they like it or not, the patient can simply request another nurse. Is that so fuckin’ hard?&lt;/p&gt;

There is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/flagrant_anti-gay_discriminati.php#comment-1531501"&gt;evidence that the damning email might have been faked&lt;/a&gt;. The "from" field of the message looks to have been crudely pasted in, and this whole story may be a product of a slighted student's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/codeblue/2009/04/03/gays_lesbians_dont_belong_in_nursing/comment"&gt;astonishing example of homophobic bigotry in a nursing college&lt;/a&gt;. A student was basically flunked out of a key course in the curriculum for a reason you will find hard to believe — here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36800888@N02/sets/72157615921627243/"&gt;letter from a nursing faculty member to the student&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nioska, I've been thinking about the meeting in rita's office and I feel that maybe Nursing is the wrong career for you. As a nurse, I have to advocate for my patients, and i feel that female patients will be uncomfortable having a lesbian nurse caring for them. You do not provide a sense of security to patients when you keep important information from them. Your sexual orientation is something important that patients have a right to know so that they can decide if they wish to have you as their caregiver. I myself am not homophobic at all, but I would not want a lesbian nurse caring for me when I am vulnerable. I would just not feel comfortable with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it might be best if you see student services to explore other career options that do not involve physical interaction, and intimacy. It wuold look better if you left nursing out of your own accord, rather than get kicked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am just being honest. at the beginning of the rotation you asked me to be honest in my feedback, and i am doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tassy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice: the student is a lesbian, and she does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; trouble her patients with her sexual orientation … and the faculty member is penalizing her for being discreet! She is actually insisting that her students declare their sexuality, a completely irrelevant characteristic, to all of her patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were in the hospital, and my nurse walked up to my bed and cheerfully announced, "I am a heterosexual!", I can guarantee you that my wife would march up to the administration and demand an immediate change of the nursing assignment. The sexual preferences of nurses may be a staple of porn films, but it is not the reality of health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look at that classic disclaimer…she&amp;#39;s not homophobic, oh no — she just wouldn&amp;#39;t want a homosexual giving her injections and changing her bedpan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely outrageous. Even worse, the college is dragging out the investigation, has hurt the student's prospects, and shows no sign of actually wanting to address the issue, preferring to try and place the blame on the student. The college also outed the student to all of her fellow students in the course of 'investigating' the problem. I've got a full account from the student below the fold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/flagrant_anti-gay_discriminati.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/flagrant_anti-gay_discriminati.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Zunis8Ec7d0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238880467084"><id gr:original-id="fKlwSynj3RGeI1v_PhJ3AQ_babfb75ee10da35cf579b08a691cfdde">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab774f5674b25dcf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Floating Jellyfish Lamp</title><published>2009-04-04T16:14:42Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T16:14:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5197240/illuminant-lamp-is-like-a-creepy-hovering-jellyfish" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Designer Kristín Birna Bjarnadóttir created the Illuminant lamp, which hovers in the air like a glowing jellyfish.</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238877353156"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/whos_not_on_the_bulletin_board">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/893e6f9310ccff26</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Who's Not on the (Bulletin) Board?</title><published>2009-04-04T20:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T20:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/whos_not_on_the_bulletin_board" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://thumb.visualizeus.com/thumbs/09/03/01/advertising,billboard,creative,graphic,design,inspiration,photography,white,space-c38613ce1f5b61bc83e95a50ff5b6d8e_m.jpg" alt="Man putting up a poster on the white space of a billboard from http://thumb.visualizeus.com/thumbs/09/03/01/advertising,billboard,creative,graphic,design,inspiration,photography,white,space-c38613ce1f5b61bc83e95a50ff5b6d8e_m.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I stopped by Charlie's school yesterday and, as I walked in the front entrance, beheld a bulletin board devoted to Autism Awareness Month.  Inside a border of puzzle ribbons were photos of &lt;a href="http://www.templegrandin.com"&gt;Temple Grandin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=54466"&gt;Dawn Prince-Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, and other (famous and perhaps not so famous, but no less of interest) individuals on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was there too much white space inbetween the cut-out photos of Grandin, Prince-Hughes, and the rest, or was it that something else was missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's class has three other students on the spectrum and, I would think, there are at least some other students mainstreamed in various classrooms throughout his middle school, with and without aides. From looking at the bulletin board, which had the words "Autism Awareness Month" at the top, you wouldn't know---be aware of---the fact that there are students on the autism spectrum in Charlie's own school. You might instead think that autism is something about people who (because they're on a bulletin board) must somehow be well-known, not something as close as one of your fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know (and am seeking to find out) whose idea the bulletin board was and what the students had been taught about autism. I've been wondering if there were concerns about not wanting to "single out" Charlie and the other students on the spectrum due to "stigma" and concerns about "labeling." But somehow, it seems there must be some way to signal that there's autism right there in Charlie's middle school---without acknowledging this, autism "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/end_game_for_awareness"&gt;awareness&lt;/a&gt;" at the school has a bit (or a lot more) of a way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238877151744"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/04/yuris-night-2009/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7c0e5409e0e2412</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Yuri’s Night 2009</title><published>2009-04-04T20:00:54Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T20:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/04/yuris-night-2009/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight is the start of &lt;a href="http://yurisnight.net/"&gt;Yuri’s night&lt;/a&gt;! It’s a global celebration of the launch of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, which was on April 12, 1961. It’s also the anniversary of the first Shuttle launch in 1981. Tonight kicks off a week of parties around the planet, and I bet there’s one somewhere near you. The Yuri’s night page has a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides, one of the founders of Yuri’s Night, sent me a note saying that there will be a pretty cool party tonight at &lt;a href="http://dc.yurisnight.net/"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt;, my old stomping ground in the Washington DC suburb of Greenbelt, MD. They’ll have a huge Hubble cake (made by Charm City Cakes, which was featured on the TV show &amp;quot;Ace of Cakes&amp;quot;), which sounds fantastic. Admission is ten bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could go, but I’m here in Boulder. Tonight I’ll be with my in-laws, celebrating their own anniversary, but perhaps I’ll raise a glass to Yuri. At the time, his government and mine were not on the best of terms, but even then some folks had a glimmer that in the future things would be better, and those differences would pale when viewed through the other end of time’s telescope. And here we are, not even half a century later, toasting the memory of the first human in space. &lt;/p&gt;

In various stages of inebriation, I’ve gone so far as to have hour-long discussions with friends about the behavior of beer bubbles. Since a good friend of mine studies fluid dynamics, these conversations have even led to various equations being scrawled on napkins, sometimes even with lip gloss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that beer bubbles seem to rise up in regular “trains” parallel to the edges of your glass? Or that beer bubbles sometimes migrate downward in your glass, apparently defying the laws of physics? Have you ever wondered why a cheap Bud Light fizzes like crazy (especially when shaken by a drunken frat boy) while a more-refined Guinness produces very few bubbles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that some scientists have actually bothered to study the “fizzics” of bubbles in alcoholic drinks. This research even has relevance for geology: understanding the behavior of dissolved gases in liquids is important for knowing how gases behave in natural liquids, such as molten magma or water. I just read a great &lt;a href="http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/full/4/1/47"&gt;tongue-and-cheek yet scientifically precise article&lt;/a&gt; published by Youxue Yang and Zhengjiu Xu at the University of Michigan. Their article is titled “The ‘Fizzics’ of Bubble Growth in Beer and Champagne.”  I’d like to recommend the article and share a quick summary of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic findings of Yang and Xu (2008):&lt;br&gt;
1. Because of the higher initial gas concentration in champagne, the “eruption velocity” of champagne is two orders of magnitude higher than CO2-based beer.&lt;br&gt;
2. Bubble growth in Guinness is slow because N2 gas is used for bubble-making. N2 has a lower solubility than CO2, so the manufacturers trap a smaller amount of N2 (relative to CO2) for the same gas pressure. The smaller bubbles which form in Guinness can sometimes be entrained in downward flow, leading to sinking beer bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

Aebly was a young man who was mugged, shot in the head, and expected to die…but he recovered, fortunately. What&amp;#39;s the connection to a dead pope? Well, there isn&amp;#39;t much of one. In the hospital, he was given a rosary that had supposedly been blessed by the pope, and his religious family now credits John Paul II for his recovery. Never mind that the pope had been dead for four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also isn't mentioned is that Aebly's friend, Jeremy Pechanec, who was also mugged and shot, died of his injuries. Was he an atheist or something? Does the pope's magic only extend to people who hold this one particular rosary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why isn&amp;#39;t this magic rosary being used regularly for all brain injury victims in the hospital right now? Sometimes people can recover from horrific injuries, so one case isn&amp;#39;t at all persuasive…now if the hospital were slapping the super-duper magic beads into every victim&amp;#39;s hands as they were being rushed through the emergency room door, and they were all getting better, then I&amp;#39;d say there is something worth investigating going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to know how many other people the hospital chaplain used his ju-ju beads on, and how many of them died. You'd think he'd be bragging a lot more about his success rate if they worked, but all we hear about is this one incredibly lucky fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the world of Catholicism, though. Reason has no role in it, sense doesn't matter, and statistics? What's that? Dead man's beads are going to get the credit, but not the surgery and care that contributed more to the recovery than superstition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/cheap_saints.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/vacNukMcnTk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238872498990"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1295">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5868cacbc8db63c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Snowclones"/><title type="html">X is the Y of Z: pop music edition</title><published>2009-04-04T19:15:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T19:15:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1295" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing today's &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1294"&gt;snowclone theme&lt;/a&gt;… For snowclone collector Mark Peters, the phrasal template &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=806"&gt;X is the Y of Z&lt;/a&gt;" is the gift that just keeps on giving.

&lt;p&gt;I hope it’s a lot. Because I have three to show you, or maybe 5, depending on how you count them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, a gorgeous trio of interacting galaxies courtesy &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/news/2009/14"&gt;the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. This group was the winner of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/28/you-can-help-point-hubble/"&gt;the contest to have people vote on where to point Hubble&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/14/image/a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3550/3411410023_9b7b9a58e2_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click this and the other pictures to get to embiggenated ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of three galaxies together are called Arp 274; Halton Arp cataloged quite a few oddly shaped galaxies, suspecting that they were more interesting than you might suppose at first glance. He was right; almost all the entries in his catalogue are galaxies interacting with one another, their mutual gravity distorting their shapes, their massive collisions triggering vast bursts of star birth across hundreds of thousands of light years of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what’s going on in this trio, located 400 million light years away. The two galaxies on the right and left are clearly undergoing massive star bursts, which can be seen as the large blotches of blue (when lots of stars are born, some are very massive and very luminous ones; these shine blue… and while they’re vastly outnumbered by lower mass redder stars, the dinkier stars shine more feebly and are harder to see). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle galaxy, however, appears relatively undisturbed. Oddly, it also seems to be at a different distance from the other two, as measured using its redshift (how fast it’s apparently moving away from us). Is it possible that the middle galaxy is merely superposed on the other two, and it’s just that pair that’s interacted sometime in the past? Or does the middle galaxy have an anomalous velocity for some unknown reason? Poking around the journal papers, I was unable to find an answer. That in itself is interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two galaxies are from &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-14-09.html"&gt;the European Southern Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. The first of these two is also a spiral, but a bit of a mess: NGC 7793, 12.5 million light years distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Galaxies/phot-14b-09-fullres.tif.html%20target="&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3043/3411409953_6d5766ed04_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo, taken with the monster 8-meter Very Large Telescope, shows off the chaotic nature of this spiral. Most big spirals have well-formed spiral arms, but this one is a disaster. Why? Interestingly, &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AJ....135.2038D"&gt;it has a lot of gas in it&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest supplies of hydrogen known in any normal galaxy. It’s also forming lots of very massive stars, so many that the gas is largely ionized (that is, stripped of electrons by the ultraviolet light from the stars) throughout the whole galaxy. Does this affect how the spiral arms form? It’s hard to say, but when you have two weird things in one place, it’s tempting to correlate them. It’s also not a terribly big spiral, less than half the diameter of the Milky Way. Does that play in to this as well? Again, it’s hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last galaxy is NGC 55, an irregular, elongated galaxy. It’s flattened and we see it roughly edge-on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Galaxies/phot-14a-09-fullres.tif.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3411409931_484a5f39b6_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image was taken by the 2.2-meter MPG/ESO telescope in La Silla, Chile. NGC 55 is pretty close by, only 7.5 million light year away, maybe three times as far as the Andromeda Galaxy. It’s a bit of a mess, but its proximity gives us a great look at it. In this image, individual stars can be seen! We can also pick out planetary nebulae; giant shells of expanding gas blown off by dying stars. The properties of these nebulae can be used to figure out how far away they are from us, which gives us the distance of the galaxy itself. It’s an irony of nature that it’s easier to figure out the distance to remote galaxies, which are swept away from us by the expansion of the Universe itself, than it is for nearby galaxies, which are too close to use the cosmic expansion for distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 55 is a bit like the Large Magellanic Cloud, an irregularly-shaped galaxy that orbits the Milky Way; both are oddly shaped, both are somewhat flattened. But NGC 55 is hugely larger than the LMC, perhaps five times as big. We’re not sure why some galaxies are irregular, and why some of these weirdos do have some shaping involved, like why being flattened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxies are huge, beautiful, intensely studied, and yet they still hold many mysteries for us to investigate. Even ones that are nearby — if you call quintillions of kilometers &amp;quot;close&amp;quot;! — and big in our telescopes still hold their secrets. But it’s images like these that will help us understand them better, and slowly unravel the tapestry of how these gorgeous objects behave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238866055161"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_354.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c1020db6785362f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-04-04T18:10:03Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T18:10:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/NdUdvJCQGms/todays_carnivals_354.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/todays_carnivals_354.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;April Scientiae is up on &lt;a href="http://candidengineer.blogspot.com/2009/04/april-scientiae-we-rise-up.html" title=""&gt;Candid Engineer in Academia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the longtime minority leader of the [New York] State Assembly, a job that requires all the quick-thinking and decision-making capacity of a fishing warden in the Gobi Desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That is, Z requires no real Y, so X requires no significant Y, either: being a fishing warden in the Gobi Desert requires no real quick-thinking or decision-making capacity, so being minority leader of the Assembly doesn't either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little ingenuity, you can google up more examples (and others with verbs similar to &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt;, like &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt;). But the question is: do such examples get their effect straightforwardly from the syntax of English (admittedly, with figurative language plugged in), or is there some short-circuiting from a complex figure to a conveyed meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know, and I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any easy way to decide in particular instances, short of finding some way to get inside people&amp;#39;s heads. The best we can do is flag some possible cases for investigation — while being open to the possibility that the status of the expression is different for different people. After all, even X IS THE NEW Y (now so omnipresent that I stopped collecting instances of it long ago) started as a fresh figure, a genuine invention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238863941018"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rally_against_institutionalization">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2bb068bab1a41d4a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Rally Against Institutionalization</title><published>2009-04-04T16:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T16:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rally_against_institutionalization" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;While the public is fed the same old "awareness" messages they've heard before, there are things that the public really needs to be aware of regarding autism and developmental disabilities, but which remain largely invisible if you're not in the middle of them.  In Yakima, WA last week, &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/03/people-with-disabilities-rally-for.html"&gt;self-advocates and allies rallied&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Yakima Valley School, an institution (not a "school") to protest the institutionalization of people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the rally, Elison excited the crowd as she spoke into a megaphone about why "the person with the disability should decide where they want to live."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How do you want to live?" she asked the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Free!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local service providers brought some developmentally disabled people they work with from throughout the Yakima Valley and as far away as Spokane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe in self-advocacy, so we can teach people with disabilities that they can speak for themselves," said Tammara Allen, an adviser with People First Spokane Valley [ed. &lt;a href="http://www.peoplefirstsv.com/"&gt;link to People First of Spokane Valley&lt;/a&gt;] who brought two women she helps. "They shouldn't be locked away in a closet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter, why should anyone care?  This isn't heart-warming or tear-jerking, it's angry developmentally disabled adults shouting for their rights--something many people find terrifying.  Aside from the fact that autistic people are among the numbers of those who are "locked away" in institutions, and that institutions are extremely costly, much more so than community-based solutions, there is a deep human ethics concern.  The conditions in most institutions are barbaric and inhumane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARC of Illinois, among others, sent out a link to the documentary &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/CloseHowe"&gt;Voices from Howe&lt;/a&gt;, an Illinois institution.  This is relatively mild material, but nevertheless appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about alternatives?  This ABC News video &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDnleaIDScM&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;Plan to help integrate disabled people&lt;/a&gt;, which highlights a woman who has CP and her autistic brother, gives the sketch of some of what Illinois is considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More awareness of social justice issues, please.  No human being should be forced to live in institutionalized conditions.  The public needs to be made aware of this issue and action taken to deliver basic human rights to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Barbara nor I ?&lt;em&gt;am &lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; able to …&lt;br&gt;
If you or I ?&lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; there, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I &lt;a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0403B&amp;amp;L=ADS-L&amp;amp;P=R3538&amp;amp;I=-3"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on the subject to ADS-L some years. I intended to post a version on Language Log, but I seem not to have gotten around to it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an addition to my (large and still growing) collection of english usage manuals, handbooks, and dictionaries — Fowler [H. Ramsey, not H.W.] &amp;amp; [Jane E.] Aaron, &lt;em&gt;The Little, Brown Handbook&lt;/em&gt; (8th ed., 2001) — arrived in the mail, and I unwrapped it, it fell open to p. 337, where the following rule for subject-verb agreement (the fourth of eleven such rules, some with several subparts) is enunciated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; (0)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;When parts of a subject are joined by &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nor&lt;/em&gt;, the verb agrees with the nearer part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; There are three clauses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; (1) When all parts of a subject joined by &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nor&lt;/em&gt; are singular, the verb is singular; when all parts are plural, the verb is plural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) When one part of the subject is singular and the other plural, avoid awkwardness by placing the plural part closer to the verb so that the verb is plural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) When the subject consists of nouns and pronouns of different person requiring different verb forms, the verb agrees with the nearer part of the subject.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Reword if this construction is awkward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) The handbook doesn't actually say what the problem is, and the way the solutions are presented conceals it. The fact is that clause (1) (slightly amended, to get the person issue out of the way) is utterly uncontroversial; I'm not aware of variation on this point, and I doubt that anyone needs to be told what to do when confronted by disjunctive subjects of the same number (and person). Clauses (2) and (3), however, treat circumstances where there is actual variation, and where writers are often genuinely puzzled; here's where the problem lies, in disjunctive subjects that differ in number or person (with verbs that show these differences morphologically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In general, i think it's a mistake for manuals to treat uncontroversial facts and disputed usage as covered by "rules" of the same sort.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, extrapolating from the clear cases in (1), we can frame a general principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disjunctive Agreement (DA): with a disjunctive subject, the verb agrees with &lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt; of the disjuncts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DA covers the cases in (1) and also (correctly) predicts that the cases in (2) and (3) are problematic — because they give rise to conflicts as to which verb form to choose, as in the examples above from my correspondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DA also makes sense semantically; each disjunct is interpreted separately as the subject of the verb (in contrast to conjunction, where the conjuncts taken together are interpreted as the subject of the verb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn't the handbook explain at least some of this? No way to tell for sure, but possibly because of the unclarities in its notion of "subject". For the purposes of rule (0) (and for the corresponding rule for conjunction), the subject is the &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; subject, which has &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot;; by talking merely about &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot;, instead of saying that these subjects are compound and have multiple subjects as their parts, the handbook avoids the whole area of constructs of type X that have multiple parts of type X, a notion that many people find mind-bending. In addition, it&amp;#39;s quite clear from the discussion of other examples that elsewhere what counts as the subject is a single word — the &lt;strong&gt;head word&lt;/strong&gt; of the subject, in modern syntactic terminology — and the authors of the handbook might have wanted not to draw attention to their shifting use of the word &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot;, so they didn&amp;#39;t delve into details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it would probably have been useful to explain to the reader that the problem in situations (2) and (3) is a conflict between conditions imposed by the grammar of english, and that nothing else in that grammar resolves the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) The handbook tries to cover all the situations might arise, and with a single principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasoning on first principles, you might think that if there is a conflict between conditions, then the construction is simply blocked. On the other hand, blocking frustrates the expression of content, so that reasoning on other first principles, you might think that conflicts are usually resolved. Indeed, Optimality Theory takes off from the claim that one condition usually &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot;, outranks the others (so that expressibility is served as much as possible). OT-style analyses are natural when the conditions in question can be ranked with respect to one another — but the problem with DA is that we have no independently motivated way of picking out the winning disjunct, so that if there&amp;#39;s to be resolution, it must be on the basis of some further principle. The handbook provides such a principle –- Agreement with the Nearest Disjunct (AND) — that is supposed to cover all the cases, including the uncontroversial cases in (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some precedent for claiming that DA conflicts are irresolvable. Charles Fillmore suggested, many years ago, that some conflicts (these in particular) produced gaps in the predictions of the grammar, analogous to paradigm gaps in morphology. There are some things you just can't say. And, in fact, a great many speakers are deeply uncomfortable with &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; resolution of the conflicts in (2) and (3). Given that, the best advice to a careful writer would probably be to avoid the situations that give rise to DA conflicts. (There's no point in being "technically" correct, if what you write is going to annoy or baffle a significant number of your readers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) The handbook assumes that there is exactly one right way to do anything. Not only doesn&amp;#39;t it allow for zero right ways — blocking — but it doesn&amp;#39;t allow for alternatives, either. Yet when you collect judgments from speakers, some of them are equally happy with more than one resolution of DA conflicts (and different speakers sometimes prefer different alternatives). Alternatives are all over the place in languages, and it seems gratuitous to insist that the &lt;strong&gt;grammar&lt;/strong&gt; of a language should always pick out One Right Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) There is evidence, in the handbook's own discussion, for a resolution principle different from AND. The crucial point here is that clause (2) has the writer &lt;strong&gt;reword&lt;/strong&gt; sentences so that sg+pl disjuncts will have plural agreement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Neither the owners nor the contractor agrees.&lt;br&gt;
Revised&lt;span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;Neither the contractor nor the owners agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the handbook prefers Agreement with the Higher Number (AHN), but only in combination with the resolution principle it prescribes, AND.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, when you collect judgments (and examples from corpora) some speakers resolve via AHN, regardless of the order of the disjuncts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the owners nor the contractor agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, some speakers resolve by Agreement with the Higher Person (AHP), so that instead of rewording to avoid "awkwardness" in the way that the handbook prescribes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Either Juarez or I am responsible.&lt;br&gt;
Revised&lt;span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;Either Juarez is responsible, or I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these speakers can resolve without rewording:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either Juarez or I is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Peter Peterson&amp;#39;s 1986 study — &amp;quot;Establishing verb agreement with disjunctively conjoined subjects: Strategies vs. principles&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;Australian Journal of Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 6.231-49) — noted resolution on the basis of proximity (AND) and also, from Eric Partridge&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Usage and Abusage&lt;/em&gt;, resolution in favor of higher number (AHN).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(e) There is evidence, in speaker judgments and examples from corpora, for still another solution to DA conflicts in the singular: Defaulting to 3sg. That is, examples like the following can be found, and some speakers find them acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither you nor I is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the evidence from actual usage is quite complex, the handbook recognizes only AND. Now, agreement with the nearest (disjunct or conjunct), case-marking by the nearest, and determination of governed verb form by the nearest are all attested in various languages as the &lt;strong&gt;standard&lt;/strong&gt; resolutions of conflicts, so that AND for English wouldn't be extraordinary from a crosslinguistic point of view. But then neither would principled resolutions of other sorts, or defaulting, or blocking, for that matter. All are attested, and often there's dialect variation with respect to the details. The point is that AND is in no way privileged on the basis of first principles or crosslinguistic considerations. Nor is it strongly supported by the evidence from actual usage. As i said above, the best advice to the careful writer is probably: don't go there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(f) The handbook falls back on appeals to &amp;quot;awkwardness&amp;quot; (cited above). Similar appeals — to &amp;quot;euphony&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;smoothness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;naturalness&amp;quot; or what &amp;quot;sounds right (or wrong)&amp;quot;, that is, to some sort of Sprachgefuehl — are astonishingly common in works of advice for writers. (Writers are fairly often told to avoid stranded prepositions — unless they&amp;#39;d sound right!) They are problematic: after all, if the readers already had a feel for what is awkward vs. effective, smooth, etc., they wouldn&amp;#39;t need the handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the handbook does provide (a few, well, two) exemplars of what counts as "awkward" in the world of DA sentences, but provides no hint as to how to extrapolate from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that writing is an art and craft, and that teaching by exemplars ("do as i do" or "do as she does") is both honorable and effective. In that context, it's best to avoid rigid arbitrary "rules" in most situations. You may choose to accept such conventions, as when you propose to write a sonnet or a haiku, but otherwise it's a matter of developing a feel for what is likely to work and what isn't. In this context, some analysis of the nature of the choices involved can be very useful to the learner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as I&amp;#39;ve said a number of times, it&amp;#39;s a bad move to elevate advice about effective choices to claims about the grammar of English — in this case, to insist that AND (or any other of the schemes for dealing with DA conflicts) is just a rule of English grammar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238862615413"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/larry_king_ground_zero_for_stu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/256f8cc915fd281f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Larry King: Ground zero for stupid polls</title><published>2009-04-04T17:12:21Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T17:12:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/5Pl5KqzyrVo/larry_king_ground_zero_for_stu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/larry_king_ground_zero_for_stu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, King's stupid poll was all about 'curing' autism.

Of course, this is a canard, given that science thrives on the open and free exchange of ideas, and it is not "close-mindedness" that (usually) leads to the rejection of dubious claims. Rather, it is the knowledge that, for many of such claims to be true, huge swaths of our current scientific understanding would have to be in error to such an extent that a major paradigm shift in various basic science would be necessary. While such paradigm shifts occasionally occur, they do not occur without the confluence of huge amounts of evidence, often coming from different fields and directions. In other words, to show that a paradigm is wrong or seriously incomplete requires evidence even more compelling than the evidence supporting the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video, via &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2009/04/pseudoscience_and_its_flawed_m.php"&gt;The World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;, explains why when woo-meisters wrap themselves in the mantle of "open-mindedness" it's almost always a crock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to keep this video around for my medical students to help them counter the inevitable charge of "close-mindedness" by CAM advocates. In fact, the part at the end, with the blond dude letting all sorts of rubbish into his brain because he has no critical thinking filter while demanding that others accept his views without evidence reminds me very much of a male version of Jenny McCarthy, full of the arrogance of ignorance. If the cartoon weren't of such a good-looking young man, I'd say it was J.B.

We &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/03/summers-received-hundreds_n_183058.html"&gt;cannot trust Larry Summers&lt;/a&gt;. He's in the pocket of the people responsible for our problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the firms that paid Summers large amounts in speaking fees include J.P. Morgan Chase. That bank offered the former Harvard president and Treasury Secretary $67,500 for a February 1, 2008 engagement. It has received $25 billion in government bailout funds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Citigroup, which has received $50 billion in taxpayer help, paid Summers $45,000 for a speech in March 2008 and another $54,000 for a speech that May.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Goldman Sachs, which has received $10 million in bailout funds, paid Summers $135,000 for a speech on April 16, 2008 and another $67,500 for a speech on June 18, 2008.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Summers also received about $5.2 million over the past year in salary from the major hedge fund D.E. Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know whose side Larry Summers is on, and it isn't the middle class or the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question: what does a $135,000 speech sound like? I come from an academic background, where we fairly routinely bring in scientists to give lectures and spend a day talking with colleagues, and it's fairly dense stuff, with lots of information. We generally pay travel costs (of course) and an honorarium of a few hundred to a thousand dollars. It's very good value for the money. There are popular heavy-hitters like Richard Dawkins who can get $10,000 for a talk, but even there they may waive the fee, as we saw in Oklahoma, and even so, they can pack an auditorium with thousands of people who want to hear what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would thousands of people line up to buy tickets to hear Larry Summers speak? Does he really have the kind of significant information to transmit that would be worth a hundred thousand dollars for an hour of time? If so, I'd like to know more about these kinds of valuable speeches, because I'd love to pay off my entire mortgage with an afternoon's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all know that these speeches are irrelevant. It&amp;#39;s a way for organizations with a lot of power and money to funnel cash to individuals with a lot of influence in government…&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, it's a form of corruption, a kind of bribe. Even if it's nominally legal, I hope Obama is smart enough to kick this shill for the financial empires off of his advisory team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/04/04/summers/"&gt;Glenn Greenwald has more to say on Summers&lt;/a&gt;. He calls the payoffs an "advanced bribe".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/putting_the_foxes_in_charge.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-ybPvyzdQ7c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238856634201"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317659032924518627.post-7636906251017926424">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e94b8f3fd0a6cfc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Darwin Rocks</title><published>2009-04-04T12:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T12:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/2009/04/darwin-rocks.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/" type="html">A small team of evolutionary ecologists from Tuebingen, Germany, just finished a rock music clip about evolution which is called "Struggle for love", together with a computer program that allows the...&lt;br&gt;

Eisen cites the player's achievements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Burress is perhaps  best known for catching the game-winning touchdown pass in the Giants’  upset victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. He  eluded Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs with an inside move, then ran to  the outside, where he caught Eli Manning’s 13-yard throw with 35  seconds remaining in the game. Burress had two receptions in the Super  Bowl, catching Manning’s first and last passes of the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In his four years with the Giants Burress caught 344 passes, which  places him 12th on the franchise’s career list, one catch ahead of  Earnest Gray and three behind Aaron Thomas. Burress had 3,681 receiving  yards and caught 33 touchdown passes for the Giants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he quotes the coach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;“Plaxico’s contribution to our championship season in 2007 can never be underestimated or undervalued,” said Head Coach Tom Coughlin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a fine example of an issue that we&amp;#39;ve often discussed many times — see &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a summary and some links. And Plaxico is not the only person in recent news reports and press releases whose contributions &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?um=1&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22cannot+be+underestimated%22"&gt;cannot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?um=1&amp;amp;ned=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q="&gt;can't&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-admin/"&gt;can never be underestimated&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href="http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;amp;id=2052"&gt;2009 Eaton Science Fiction Conference&lt;/a&gt;, for example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"We are really delighted to be able to host an Eaton conference with this emphasis on Jules Verne,” said Melissa Conway, head of Special Collections and Archives at UCR. “Verne’s influence – right up to the present day – cannot be underestimated."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href="http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/03/12/will-michael-jacksons-comeback-shows-be-all-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; of Michael Jackson's comeback tour in the U.K. tells us that "his drawing power can’t be underestimated". I knew about Jules Verne and Michael Jackson, but not about Cindy Sherman, though Alexis Loinaz tells me &lt;a href="http://newyork.metromix.com/movies/article/who-is-cindy-sherman/1052081/content"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that "Cindy's prowess just can't be underestimated"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the sum of Google News hits for "cannot be underestimated" (219) "can't be underestimated" (112) and "can never be underestimated" (256) is 587, and without checking them all, I'll be that they all mean "must not be underestimated" or "cannot be overestimated". This compares to 40 for the logically correct "cannot be overestimated" (29) "can't be overestimated" (9) and "can never be overestimated" (2); or 18 for "must not be underestimated" (17) "mustn't be underestimated" (1) and "must never be underestimated" (0). The only logically sound alternative that's competitive is "should not be underestimated" (618) "shouldn't be underestimated" (54) and "should never be underestimated" (46), which wins out in this morning's count by a mere 718 to 587.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that "cannot be underestimated" should be considered an idiom, like &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002171.html"&gt;"still unpacked"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000500.html"&gt;"fail to miss"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002253.html"&gt;"could care less"&lt;/a&gt;? I don't think so, at least not exactly. One &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004719.html"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is that the same pattern applies to "impossible to underestimated", "hard to underestimate", "difficult to underestimate"; to "cannot understate", "cannot undervalue", "cannot underrate"; and so on.  In the other direction, expressions like "should not be overestimated" are also &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004716.html"&gt;often used&lt;/a&gt; to say the opposite what they literally mean. Whenever we combine negation, concepts of possibility or difficulty, and thresholds on a scale of evaluation, people seem to get their wires crossed in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people argue that all these examples are logically correct - that is, they actually do mean what their authors intend them to mean –  if you only analyze their semantics in the right way. I incline towards the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004716.html"&gt;"poor monkey brains"&lt;/a&gt; theory myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out soon, as some representatives from the Skeptic Zone plan to make the trek to Melbourne in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes Richard Saunders and myself, but also &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/"&gt;Kylie Sturgess&lt;/a&gt; all the way from Perth, plus our very good friend and regular special guest, &lt;a href="http://www.davethehappysinger.com"&gt;Dave the Happy Singer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to mosey down for some interviews, a talk or two, and a few beers with our very good friends, the YAS. Not forgetting of course, Joel Birch, &lt;a href="http://www.fppdesign.com.au/"&gt;Catherine Donaldson,&lt;/a&gt; and Matt from &lt;a href="http://ilikeportello.blogspot.com/"&gt;ilikeportello blogspot&lt;/a&gt;, plus whoever else we have met along the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need some help however. Richard and I would like to give a double-header talk, but we need advice on a venue. Can you help? Leave a comment if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard does a talk entitled “&lt;strong&gt;Scepticism 101&lt;/strong&gt;” and mine is “&lt;strong&gt;Dr Rachie Reports; adventures of a scientist in an alternative medicine world&lt;/strong&gt;“. (We anticipate we will probably be in town for a weekend in May).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you have a few extra dollars floating around just aching for a good cause, we would sincerely appreciate help with raising funds for our plane tickets. Even if you can chuck 20 bucks our way, it all helps a group of dedicated volunteers, doing our best to spread the word of science and reason. (There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;amp;SESSION=4LvJQJFrQAgmrO-6eKrpQpsOGiQMMSPI20nPYOulkkX8jT6X4xy6hUJB5uq&amp;amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1fa798f5a5f5ae42e779d4b5655493f6179c7b0ecd252eac84"&gt;paypal button&lt;/a&gt; on our website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hold on to your hats, tell your friends, and watch out Melbourne!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psst! I can’t wait to meet &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jacksmother"&gt;@jacksmother&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This isn't an advocacy post, or a post about accommodations or activism, or that much-under-discussion word, "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/end_game_for_awareness"&gt;awareness&lt;/a&gt;." I suppose it's possible to read some of these into the post. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: This is a post about Charlie and me doing the diner thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd rather that I had written "Jim, Charlie and me," but that would be inaccurate. Jim is at &lt;a href="http://www.nd.edu"&gt;Notre Dame University&lt;/a&gt; for a conference so it's been me and the boy. Jim is coming back today and we'll again be our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;tight team of three&lt;/a&gt;. Jim and Charlie certainly made out good &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;while I was in Greece&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ode_to_family"&gt;grandparental support&lt;/a&gt;) and Charlie and I have certainly spent, oh, &lt;em&gt;a whole lotta time&lt;/em&gt; together. But it all goes more smoothly with the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take weekday mornings, for one thing. Charlie's always had a hard time waking up in the morning and getting out of his bed and the fact that he seems to be in (yet another) growth spurt means that he's extra extra tired, and no amount of sleep seems "too much." As we currently live in a second-floor apartment with no views of the parking lot where Charlie catches the bus, it works best to have one parent standing in the lot on the lookout for the bus while the other parent helps Charlie get ready and out the door. When there's only one parent, it's a bit more intense and interesting, and harried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, Charlie woke up around 6.30 on Friday morning and (though it was getting kind of last minute) got out of bed on his own and clomped down the stairs to meet the bus. (It was raining, but he didn't mind----he usually doesn't.) When the bus returned a couple of hours later in the afternoon, Charlie got off on his own; clomped back up the stairs and had a snack and we did a little cello and then (the rain having cleared up) a good walk, Charlie keeping just a bit ahead of me as we passed little groups of kids and their parents, enjoying the sunshine after all the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually go into New York on Friday night and meet Jim at his office and have dinner. But it hardly made sense to go into the city with no goal of visiting "Dad's office" and seeing Dad so---after checking my plan out with Charlie----we drove into Jersey City around 6pm and to the &lt;a href="http://brownstonediner.com/"&gt;Brownstone Diner&lt;/a&gt;. We sat opposite each other in a booth, me with coffee and Charlie with Sprite, and waited for our orders which, as you can see from the photo, were heavy on the French fries----most eaten (consumer/wolfed down/fast dispatched of) by Charlie, with requisite amounts of ketchup for anyone wearing (as he was in fact) &lt;a href="http://store.cottonfactory.com/cf-654.html"&gt;this shirt&lt;/a&gt;. The long-haired waiter remembered that Charlie gets his hamburger medium and offered to refill my coffee before I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our plates were almost bare (he left an onion ring and I wrapped up my English muffin), Charlie asked for his black fleece and would have headed out the door, but I called him back as I stood in line to pay the bill. He betook himself to the display case to check out the cakes, chocolate and white with white frosting whorls and a maraschino cherry, whole and in slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie didn't ask for a piece. Indeed, he seemed in a semi-hurry to get back to his familiar post in the middle of the back seat of the black car, from which he viewed a number of city sights as we drove up Montgomery, down Kennedy Boulevard and West Side Avenue to Sip, and &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/we-take-the-skyway/"&gt;up into the Skyway&lt;/a&gt;, up above the Meadowlands and over diamond patches of lights and more, more lights.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238824221355"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2782">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f9ba8f4a04ca0f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Future Technology"/><category term="AI"/><category term="Robots"/><title type="html">Science being outsourced to robots</title><published>2009-04-04T05:49:26Z</published><updated>2009-04-04T05:49:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/science-being-outsourced-to-robots/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143451.htm"&gt;Researchers have created a ‘robot scientist’&lt;/a&gt; which they believe is the first machine to have independently discovered new scientific knowledge. The robot, named Adam, is a computer system that fully automates the scientific process. Adam’s work will be published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists at Aberystwyth University and the University of Cambridge designed Adam to carry out each stage of the scientific process automatically without the need for further human intervention. The robot has discovered simple but new scientific knowledge about the genomics of the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism that scientists use to model more complex life systems. The researchers have used separate manual experiments to confirm that Adam’s hypotheses were both novel and correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well Liberty “University” is even graciously selling the book in their own campus bookstore. . .&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/03/even-after-his-death-jerry-falwell-causes-trouble/"&gt;with a disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Readers of the Unlikely Disciple should be aware that &lt;strong&gt;many factual inaccuracies&lt;/strong&gt; were identified in this book by Liberty University faculty and staff reviewers. Some examples of the factual errors: the book quotes Dr. Falwell as saying the third world doesn’t need food and water, only the gospel. &lt;strong&gt;He never made such a statement&lt;/strong&gt; and often preached that Christians should not expect the hungry and the homeless to accept the gospel until Christians had first met their needs to be fed and clothed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book also perpetuates the myth that Dr. Falwell accused Tinky Winky of being gay.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, Dr. Falwell had never heard of Tinky Winky when an AP reporter asked him about an editorial in his National Liberty Journal newspaper that cited reports from the Washington Post that Tinky Winky might have been meant to portray a “gay” character. &lt;strong&gt;The book is well written but contains quite a bit of fiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the opinion of the reviewers, these inaccuracies raise questions about the credibility of the author and the accuracy of any unverifiable statements or quotes contained in the book. Readers should be skeptical about the veracity of any information contained in The Unlikely Disciple. Readers are also cautioned that &lt;strong&gt;The Unlikely Disciple contains offensive sexual references that Liberty University does not recommend for student readers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of that’s actually true in the strictest sense of the word. And by that I mean that it’s not even the slightest bit true, &lt;a href="http://www.kevinroose.com/blog/2009/04/the-liberty-situation-continued/"&gt;as Roose himself explains in his response to the disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a convocation speech he gave during my Liberty semester, Dr. Falwell said, “What is it that world citizens need most today? As hungry as some are, it’s not food. It is not material things. It is not education. What this world needs most is the word of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the audio clip of this quote, &lt;a href="http://www.kevinroose.com/blog/wp-content/falwell-quote.mp3"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the book not perpetuate the Tinky Winky myth, it actively dispels it.  From page 193:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At one point, we’re talking about my upcoming interview with Dr. Falwell, and Max tells me that I should ask him about the time he “outed the gay Teletubby.” I remember learning that Dr. Falwell’s comments about Tinky-Winky may not have been entirely his — they originated in an unsigned editorial in his National Liberty Journal newsletter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roose concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of a book that attempts to portray Liberty fairly and even-handedly, formulating a sloppy, ad hominem response like the one posted in the Liberty bookstore hardly seems like the reasonable — or the Christian — thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch. While I hate to use the rather childish terms “pwned!” or “owned!” there doesn’t seem to be any words that better describe how well Roose has utterly demolished the bogus claims of Liberty “University.” Yeah, if the school were wearing pants, they’d be bursting in flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was asked to stand for the invocation, followed by the pledge of allegiance. At first, I did not hear what it was I was asked to stand for; the room was filled with thousands of people talking. When I stood, I was met with a political tirade about how the speaker, Don Wager Pres. of our board of trustees, ought to be able to pray at any government event he chooses to pray at. Essentially what he said was that we were here today to recognize the students and also thank God for these achievements, and you could sit down if you did not agree with him! In a few sentences I had been both congratulated by Wagner and also and insulted by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/pres-of-our-board-of-trustees-at-saddleback-college-not-a-fan-of-atheist/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/aM-PA67JA9s/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event prompted Ashley to form the Free-Thinkers Club at Saddleback College. And now thanks to her efforts, invocations will no longer be made at the ceromony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an Associated Student Government meeting on Thursday, March 5, students passed a resolution regarding the removal of the invocation before the annual Scholarship Award Ceremony. As a result of its passing, the ASG will now plan the scholarship ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And courtesy of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/03/why-are-college-atheist-groups-important/"&gt;Friendly Atheist&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

But here we are. &lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/04/65056205/1"&gt;Iowa is the third U.S. to grant the full legal rights of marriage to same-sex couples&lt;/a&gt;. . .not counting California, which had legalized same-sex marriage too until religious institutions, most notably the Mormons, got away with violating the conditions of their tax exempt status to launch a massive campaign in favor of the absurd Proposition 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut and Massachusetts are the other 2 states that allow same-sex marriage. &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hZmLBrL36NObNyMR0ghXN7vB5hYwD97ANCJ00"&gt;And Vermont is on its way to becoming the 4th state to allow it&lt;/a&gt;. Vermont, New Hampshire, and my home state of New Jersey already grant &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE53248C20090403"&gt;same-sex civil unions&lt;/a&gt; that for the most part give the same state rights as married couples — from insurance coverage to tax benefits and hospital visiting rights — but lack the full legal protections of marriage. And finally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and Washington each offer gay couples some legal rights as partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Iowa for joining the 21st century!&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000442" title=""&gt;Harmonics of Circadian Gene Transcription in Mammals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Circadian rhythms confer adaptive advantages by allowing organisms to anticipate daily changes in their environment. Over the last few years, many groups have used microarray technology to systematically identify genes under circadian regulation. We have extended on these studies by profiling the circadian transcriptome from the mouse liver and two immortalized cell lines at an unprecedentedly high temporal resolution. We identified over 3,000 different transcripts in the mouse liver that cycle with a period length of approximately 24 hours. To our surprise, we also identified two classes of genes which cycle with period lengths of 12 and 8 hours; i.e., harmonics of the circadian clock. Importantly, we were able to identify harmonics in five other tissue types; however, these rhythms were undetectable in disassociated cells. Moreover, harmonics were lost in the liver when mice are subjected to restricted feeding, suggesting that at least one component of circadian harmonics is driven by feeding.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000437" title=""&gt;Bacterial Toxin-Antitoxin Systems: More Than Selfish Entities?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are diverse and widespread in the prokaryotic kingdom. They are composed of closely linked genes encoding a stable toxin that can harm the host cell and its cognate labile antitoxin, which protects the host from the toxin's deleterious effect. TA systems are thought to invade bacterial genomes through horizontal gene transfer. Some TA systems might behave as selfish elements and favour their own maintenance at the expense of their host. As a consequence, they may contribute to the maintenance of plasmids or genomic islands, such as super-integrons, by post-segregational killing of the cell that loses these genes and so suffers the stable toxin's destructive effect. The function of the chromosomally encoded TA systems is less clear and still open to debate. This Review discusses current hypotheses regarding the biological roles of these evolutionarily successful small operons. We consider the various selective forces that could drive the maintenance of TA systems in bacterial genomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000434" title=""&gt;Alliance of Proteomics and Genomics to Unravel the Specificities of Sahara Bacterium Deinococcus deserti&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;D. deserti belongs to the Deinococcaceae, a family of bacteria characterized by an exceptional ability to withstand the lethal effects of DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, UV light, and desiccation. It was isolated from Sahara surface sands, an extreme and nutrient-poor environment, regularly exposed to intense UV radiation, cycles of extreme temperatures, and desiccation. The evolution of organisms that are able to survive acute irradiation doses of 15,000 Gy is difficult to explain given the apparent absence of highly radioactive habitats on Earth over geologic time. Thus, it seems more likely that the natural selection pressure for the evolution of radiation-resistant bacteria was chronic exposure to nonradioactive forms of DNA damage, in particular those promoted by desiccation. Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of a bacterium, D. deserti VCD115, isolated from hot, arid desert surface sand. Accurate genome annotation of its 3,455 genes was guided by extensive proteome analysis in which 1,348 proteins were uncovered after growth in standard conditions. Supplementary genes involved in manganese import, in nutrient import, and in DNA repair were identified and are likely important for survival and adaptation of D. deserti to its hostile environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000445" title=""&gt;Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Scans for Human Adult Stature Identifies Novel Loci and Associations with Measures of Skeletal Frame Size&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first genetic association studies of adult height have confirmed a role of many common variants in influencing human height, but to date, the genetic basis of differences between different skeletal components of height have not been addressed. Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of common genetic variants on both height and skeletal components of height. By examining nearly 20,000 individuals from the UK and the Netherlands, we provide statistically significant evidence that 17 genomic regions are associated with height, including four novel regions. We also examine, for the first time, the association of these 17 regions with skeletal size measurements of spine, femur, and hip axis length, a measurement of hip geometry known to influence the risk of osteoporotic fractures. We find that some height loci are also associated with these skeletal components, although further statistical tests will be required to verify if these genetic variants act differentially on the individual skeletal measurements. The knowledge generated by this and other studies will not only inform the genetics of human quantitative variation, but will also lead to the potential discovery of many medically important polymorphisms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005100" title=""&gt;Manipulation of an Innate Escape Response in Drosophila: Photoexcitation of acj6 Neurons Induces the Escape Response&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The genetic analysis of behavior in Drosophila melanogaster has linked genes controlling neuronal connectivity and physiology to specific neuronal circuits underlying a variety of innate behaviors. We investigated the circuitry underlying the adult startle response, using photoexcitation of neurons that produce the abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (acj6) transcription factor. This transcription factor has previously been shown to play a role in neuronal pathfinding and neurotransmitter modality, but the role of acj6 neurons in the adult startle response was largely unknown. We show that the activity of these neurons is necessary for a wild-type startle response and that excitation is sufficient to generate a synthetic escape response. Further, we show that this synthetic response is still sensitive to the dose of acj6 suggesting that that acj6 mutation alters neuronal activity as well as connectivity and neurotransmitter production. These results extend the understanding of the role of acj6 and of the adult startle response in general. They also demonstrate the usefulness of activity-dependent characterization of neuronal circuits underlying innate behaviors in Drosophila, and the utility of integrating genetic analysis into modern circuit analysis techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005081" title=""&gt;Androgen Receptor Copy Number Variation and Androgenetic Alopecia: A Case-Control Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The functional polymorphism that explains the established association of the androgen receptor (AR) with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) remains unidentified, but Copy Number Variation (CNV) might be relevant. CNV involves changes in copy number of large segments of DNA, leading to the altered dosage of gene regulators or genes themselves. Two recent reports indicate regions of CNV in and around AR, and these have not been studied in relation to AGA. The aim of this preliminary case-control study was to determine if AR CNV is associated with AGA, with the hypothesis that CNV is the functional AR variant contributing to this condition. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification was used to screen for CNV in five AR exons and a conserved, non-coding region upstream of AR in 85 men carefully selected as cases and controls for maximal phenotypic contrast. There was no evidence of CNV in AR in any of the cases or controls, and thus no evidence of significant association between AGA and AR CNV. The results suggest this form of genomic variation at the AR locus is unlikely to predispose to AGA.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_34.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ZbTnA1fr2yc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238803369075"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-364894514159992845">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b1d3847a1f7a413</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Who is Open Minded, the Believer or the Scientifically Minded Skeptic?</title><published>2009-04-04T23:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T23:50:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/cXr-vedoA1g/who-is-open-minded-believer-or.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/364894514159992845/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=364894514159992845" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/who-is-open-minded-believer-or.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">The video might take a bit to load...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/T69TOuqaqXI%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-364894514159992845?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Today, Manchester Airport UK announced &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/144646.php"&gt;a new guidebook for autistic children and their families&lt;/a&gt; to help make the experience of flying to and from Manchester more stress-free.  The book can be found and downloaded from the airport's &lt;a href="http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/AirportAccessibilty"&gt;accessibility page&lt;/a&gt; (scroll down to the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fantastic that Manchester is thinking about access needs for people on the spectrum.  The guide is easy to understand and provides information both graphically and in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Many airplane trips involved more than one airport.  How can the guide book idea be expanded to cover more ground?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Autistic adults also use airlines and airports, both with and without travel companions.  How can such a guide be translated to the adult audience?  How can the idea be expanded to reach a wider population, including people who are not autistic but who would have better airline experiences by using such a tool?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238799121930"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/randi_restored.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b97587fa550bfbce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Randi restored</title><published>2009-04-03T23:30:42Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T23:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/aMZOR_vhlBQ/randi_restored.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/randi_restored.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Youtube has restored the JREF account.&lt;/p&gt;

How about communicating &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;, and then yanking if someone is intransigent?

Why is the Pope Catholic? Why is the darkness dark? Why does Microsoft suck? These aren't interesting questions: the point is that they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred forty characters is exactly enough room for a "Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!", but not enough for lengthy monologuing, the bane of villain's plans everywhere. It's enough to leave vague hints that has everyone wondering and guessing to what, exactly, one is up. One can easily configure it so one is only receiving tweets from a tiny number of people, who can mostly be ignored, while sending tweets that distract thousands.

I think what I’ve written fits together as a whole quite well, but if the reader really wants to get the full scope of it then try reading through the book a second time. Several arguments in the early parts of the book depend for their force on the arguments in the later parts of the book.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One such scattered “gem,” if you will, is mentioned on page 61 where I argued that since methodological naturalism “has produced so many significant results, I think it should equally be used to investigate the Bible, its claims of the miraculous, and the origins of the universe itself, and it provides a great deal of evidence against the Christian faith.” [I mention this on pages 50, 119-120, and again on page 185].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is methodological naturalism? It’s a method in scientific inquiry whereby “all hypotheses and events are to be explained and tested by reference to natural causes and events.” &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html"&gt;Dr. Barbara Forrest&lt;/a&gt; tells us that “a massive amount of knowledge" has been gained by using this method. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This same method has been adopted by historians. Bart D. Ehrman, as a historian, adopts this method when it comes to studying the Bible, especially the New Testament, his area of specialty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_criticism"&gt;Biblical Criticism&lt;/a&gt; can probably be seen in light of the rise of modern science which adopted the method of naturalism. Again, we’ve gained a “massive amount of knowledge” from using it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applied to Biblical studies scholars have assumed a natural rather than a supernatural explanation for the stories inside the pages of the Bible. Based on the assumption that the past is just like the present in which miracles don’t occur, by taking their cue from the scientific enterprise that assumes a natural explanation for everything, Biblical scholars began studying the Bible afresh. As historians that’s what they must do. Robert M. Price tells us that if historians didn’t assume a natural explanation for events in the past they would be “at the mercy of every medieval tale, every report that a statue wept, or that someone changed lead into gold or turned into a werewolf.” [&lt;em&gt;Incredible Shrinking Son of Man&lt;/em&gt;, p. 20].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many believers reject what these Biblical scholars as historians do, but why? Why is it that methodological naturalism has worked extremely well in every area where it's been used--every single one--but that when it comes to looking the collection of canonized books in the Bible such a method should not be used? My claim is that since methodological naturalism has worked so extremely well in every area where it's been used--every single one--that we should apply that same method when it comes to studying the Bible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If believers don’t want to apply methodological naturalism across the board into Biblical studies, then please tell me where it should be applied and where it shouldn't. If this method should not be applied to the Bible then why do believers hold to a double standard, allowing it to be used when seeking a cure for cancer (why not call for a miracle worker instead?), or to discover our evolutionary biology (why not just quote Genesis 1 and shun science altogether?), or to explain the weather (why not just do a rain dance?), or a crime scene (why not just cast lots as they supposedly did in Joshua's day?), or a freak tragic accident (why not just say God was punishing someone?), or a noise in the night (demons? angels?), but not when it comes to the stories in the Bible? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is probably the crux of the issue with me. Without assuming a natural explanation in science and in historical studies we would still think God alone opens the womb, that sicknesses are the result of sin, that the reason we win wars is because God was pleased, and the reason why there are natural disasters is because God is displeased. Given these type of supernatural explanations we would already have the needed explanations in God so there would be no room for science, which is undeniably important to the human race for a wide variety of reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-524278070519127385?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Yesterday saw the introduction of a bill to establish a national comprehensive autism strategy for the entire US, the &lt;a href="http://www.autismvotes.org/site/c.frKNI3PCImE/b.4784269/k.C0E5/ATAA.htm"&gt;Autism Treatment Acceleration Act&lt;/a&gt; of 2009 (ATAA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATAA requires insurance companies to cover diagnosis and also treatments including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and assistive technology; to create a demonstration project to develop Autism Care Center; to create another demonstration project that would "provide a full array of services to adults with autism to improve their quality of life and enable them to live as independently as possible"; to establishe an Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee to coordinate various government activities concerning autism, and to consist of representatives from relevant governmental agencies, researchers and the public; to establish a voluntary population-based autism case registry and also a national training initiative about autism, as well as a national media campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill was introduced by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Robert Menendez (D- NJ), who had been asked by President Obama to do so. More information about the ATAA and its 12 sections can be found on &lt;a href="http://www.autismvotes.org/site/c.frKNI3PCImE/b.4784269/k.C0E5/ATAA.htm"&gt;Autism Votes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, those are the basics: But what do you think about the act? What parts would you like to see changed or revised, or what also should be added?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very glad for the mention of the demonstration project for adults and would like to see more recognition of the needs of older children and adults----as an article in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/brain-and-behavior/2009/04/02/teenagers-with-autism-want-a-job.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; makes clear, we need to start now to provide employment, training for jobs, services, housing, for those who are children today, and for those who are teenagers and adults right now. And I'd like to see a clear emphasis on autism as a lifelong disability, so that treatment can center around education and teaching and training, throughout the lives of individuals on the spectrum---an accelerated focus on these issues would be deeply welcomed, and definitely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/GreenWho.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/GreenWho.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Russian means "Green Beach"; with a Slavic pronunciation of English, that might come out the same as "Green Bitch," both being pronounced "Green Beech."  Russians seem to have a hard time with the distinction between [i] and [ɪ].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immediately reminds me of Geoffrey Pullum's "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1190"&gt;The bitches of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;."   Apparently Russians aren't the only ones who have a hard time with the &lt;span&gt;[i] - [ɪ] &lt;/span&gt;distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, when teaching English to speakers of various Chinese languages, I&amp;#39;ve discovered that one of the hardest things — in terms of pronunciation — for them to master is distinguishing among the fine gradations of vowel quality that make such a crucial difference for understanding others and expressing oneself clearly:  pin, pine, pan, pane / &lt;span&gt;pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pen, peen, pun, poon, pone, peon (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pē&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;ŏn&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;, pē&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;ən; also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pyūn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), paen….&lt;/p&gt;

Burke); and (from Breffni O'Rourke) an observation about different verbs &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, Bache, who noted (in 1869) that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many persons who do not say "I &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;" and "I &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;," do say, "I &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own copy of &lt;em&gt;Vulgarisms And Other Errors Of Speec&lt;/em&gt;h has arrived, and it seems, from internal evidence (publication in Philadelphia, references to the American publication &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;, a footnote, p. 134, saying, "The word &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; is here used as referring to the whole of the United States&amp;quot;), that this particular Bache was in fact American. I don&amp;#39;t at the moment have information about where he lived — potentially significant, since much later reports of PSP &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; associate the form especially to the South and South Midlands of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bache is probably a red herring. He doesn't actually cite anyone saying or writing "I have saw", but instead is reporting instances (from newspapers and other publications, one of them English) of what is in fact faulty parallelism, involving the coordination of a clearly perfect VP with a second VP that is past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[from a correspondent] Hold a mirror so that Planet Jupiter may be reflected in it, when two of the satellites may be seen with the naked eye. [from the writer] We have tried it, and saw satellites of Jupiter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— and family have arrived in Washington, and took up their headquarters for the winter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have walked four or five miles, and although much fatigued, went to a dozen places&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Hawley had … beat down two little stone walls, and came in upon the right flank of the second line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that Bache is claiming these examples contain instances of (respectively) &amp;quot;We have saw …&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;— and family have took …&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I have went …&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;General Hawley had came …&amp;quot; But they don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A digression on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon in question is often known as &amp;quot;reduced coordination&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;conjunction reduction&amp;quot;, though such labels prejudice the way you think about examples; they encourage you to think that coordinations of non-clausal constituents are &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; (in some sense) coordinations of clausal constituents, with some repeated material omitted or &amp;quot;understood&amp;quot;. However this idea is to be interpreted — and there are several different ways out there — in none of them is &lt;em&gt;have seen the Queen&lt;/em&gt; a constituent in "We have been to London and seen the Queen", or &lt;em&gt;have saw the Queen&lt;/em&gt; a constituent in "We have been to London and saw the Queen". (Ok, there are some non-standard views of constituency in which such analyses are possible. But they go way beyond the views we're looking at here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's an unexpressed assumption that coordination is "really" of clauses and everything else is parasitic on that. I'm sure this idea can be traced back to the Greek and Latin grammarians and logicians, where it's a natural concomitant of a focus on truth, deductive reasoning, and so on. But this assumption leads people to posit material that is not actually in sentences and to critique examples on that basis.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially struck by Bache's claim to have come across instances of PSP &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; (and other verbs) in reasonably elevated writing and speaking. As far as I know, PSP&amp;lt;PST has always been non-standard (though widespread in some regions by some speakers at some times). I simply wouldn&amp;#39;t have expected the sources Bache cites to &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; have used &lt;em&gt;have saw&lt;/em&gt; and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what &lt;strong&gt;were&lt;/strong&gt; they doing? Looks to me like coordination of VPs in different tense/aspect constructions: a perfect-aspect [some would say a non-deictic past tense — see &lt;em&gt;CGEL&lt;/em&gt;, chapter 3, section 5] VP with a simple past-tense VP. Is this by definition an instance of "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002313.html"&gt;faulty parallelism&lt;/a&gt;", to be excoriated on that basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not. There is no general constraint against coordinating constituents with different values for some feature of form. Singular and plural NPs, for example, are easily coordinated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;A knife&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;two forks&lt;/span&gt; are provided in each setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many coordinations of VPs differing in features of form are also unproblematic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;went&lt;/span&gt; to Paris three years ago and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;am living&lt;/span&gt; there still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;have gone&lt;/span&gt; to Paris many times and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;hope&lt;/span&gt; to return soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;have gone&lt;/span&gt; to Paris many times and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; always &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;fascinated&lt;/span&gt; by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some coordinations are more awkward than others — a matter of semantics/pragmatics, not syntax, I think — and handbooks often recommend against shifting tense, but when there&amp;#39;s a problem it&amp;#39;s a matter of shifting point of view, not of syntax. Some of Bache&amp;#39;s examples might strike some readers as clunky, though in context I find most of them unproblematic. For example, the &lt;em&gt;have tried … saw&lt;/em&gt; example seems entirely natural to me, on the understanding 'We have tried it, and [when we did] we saw satellites of Jupiter'. When there's a problem, it's a matter of sequence of verb forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, writers of standard English didn't actually use &lt;em&gt;have saw&lt;/em&gt; in the 19th century (and haven't used it in the 20th or 21st).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for putative-antique &lt;em&gt;have saw&lt;/em&gt;. On to actual occurrences of &lt;em&gt;have saw&lt;/em&gt;. Since PSP&amp;lt;PST is such a natural levelling, I would expect it to have a considerable history. So it&amp;#39;s nice that John V. Burke was able to dredge up an example from the 1920&amp;#39;s, in the vernacular of a Ring Lardner character. I&amp;#39;m giving the whole quote — from Ring Lardner, Jr. &lt;em&gt;The Lardners: My Family Remembered&lt;/em&gt; (New York, Harper Colophon Books, 1977) — that Burke sent me, since it has entertainment value beyond the verb forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of signs to suggest a revival of interest in the work of Ring Lardner… During his lifetime and for thirty years after his death, he was practically unknown outside the English-speaking world; this year there are collections of his stories on sale in France, Italy, West and East Germany, Rumania, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and a number of other countries. How full an appreciation of his work there can be in all these new languages, I am not competent to judge, but clearly some obstacles have not been surmounted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhythm at least of 'And he gave her a look that you could pour on a waffle' is lost when it becomes 'E le diede un'occhiata che avreste potuto spalmarla benissimo su una fettina di pane.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reader is not getting the same sense of the character speaking the line when 'I've saw outfielders tooken sick with a dizzy spell' is converted to 'J'ai vu des joueurs de l'exterieure avoir une attaque de vertige.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doubly marked &lt;em&gt;tooken&lt;/em&gt; is delightful, and has been reported before. I have even written about it in a piece on child language ("A double regularity in the acquisition of English verb morphology", &lt;em&gt;Papers in Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 3.3.411-8 (1970)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the relevant bit is PSP &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;. I assume that the PSP&amp;lt;PST levelling has a much longer history, but at the moment I don&amp;#39;t have evidence on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Breffni O'Rourke on uses of &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;. Scholars of English recognize that there are two ranges of &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; — main verb (&amp;quot;activity&amp;quot;) &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;, as in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; what I can.&lt;br&gt;
I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; my homework.&lt;br&gt;
What I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; was turn the dial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and auxiliary &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; (also known as "supportive" &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;), as in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Did&lt;/span&gt; you read the assignment?&lt;br&gt;
I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; like butter on my bread.&lt;br&gt;
I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; not see that coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ranges of &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; differ in meaning and in syntax, and are clearly now separate lexical items (despite their common history). But in standard English they continue to share their inflectional morphology. O&amp;#39;Rourke notes that in non-standard varieties with PST (&amp;lt;PSP) &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, even the inflectional morphology is differentiated: only the main verb &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; has this variant for the PST, while the auxiliary has &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, as in standard English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; my homework.&lt;br&gt;
What I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; was turn the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Done&lt;/span&gt; you read the assignment?&lt;br&gt;
*I &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; not see that coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether it was the tedious photometry of 1,500 stars in a cluster during &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/search/label/internship"&gt;my internship&lt;/a&gt;, or the laborious pouring over journals and trying to come up with a future research plan for &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/search/label/flare%20research"&gt;my flare star research&lt;/a&gt; or even the advanced physics labs in which we spent far too much time for far too little credit demonstrating principles we had long since taken for granted, that final result of getting an answer and knowing that it was &lt;i&gt;meaningful&lt;/i&gt; was a wonderful feeling of success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what is it we teach in high school labs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinking back to the labs I did in high school, I can only remember about three labs. One was rolling blocky cars down inclined planes and trying to measure the force of gravity. One involved some pulleys and who knows what the point of that was. The last was spinning electrons in a magnetic field in some manner that caused them to scintilate and the diameter of the circle could be measured to determine the mass of the electron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I always liked labs at that point, but in reflection, it was for a very different reason. It was a free day or two to not have to think. All we had to do was blindly measure what we were told, plug it into the equation we were given, and pop out numbers that were off from the values we should have been getting by, quite often, nearly an order of magnitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't be certain that my high school experience is completely indicative of the situation in the majority of schools (although Time magazine did choose my high school as representative of American high schools in 1999 when they did an &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992319,00.html"&gt;expose on what life in high school is really like since Columbine&lt;/a&gt;), but assuming such conditions are common, I see two major problems with this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first is that such labs don't hold the students accountable for why they do anything they do in such labs. There is little connection between what is taught in the lecture portion, and how the lab was created to illustrate or test the concept in question. Pick up any journal article and there is always a lengthy section right at the beginning setting up the theoretical framework before &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; description of methodology in an experiment is even approached. Yet this has always been absent from my memory of high school labs as well as the introductory astronomy labs I taught during my time at KU. While I was able to insert this material in my own labs via my lectures prior to the start of lab, this, as best my memory serves, was completely absent from any labs in lower levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing that is similarly neglected in high school labs is something that actually stands out like a sore thumb: The amount of error. Error in measurements is, of course, unavoidable. Whether its due to inherent limitations in tools, or variables that cannot be constrained at such levels (eg. how do you try to approach friction and drag in carts when the math needed to do so is at least two years of college beyond what most high school students will ever obtain), the order of magnitude errors I discussed earlier are often just swept under the rug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what does this tell students? The message is that science is sloppy. Measurements can be wildly different and it's ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's not included, but I feel should be, is at the very least, some sort of quantitative analysis of the error involved. In my own classroom, I've seen this attempted, and the way I've always seen it done for low level classes is wholly disappointing. In most low level classrooms, the method to determine error is that you take the difference between the "True" value and your value, and divide it by the "True" value. This gives the amount that you're off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But since when does real science have a "True" value by which to compare the derived value?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never. And we wonder why people nod in agreement when creationists push the notion that science is dogmatic when we're the ones putting ideas of "True" values in their head?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This methodology seems entirely counterproductive. While equations to determine error are obviously beyond the capabilities of high school students, I feel there is still a solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the capability to carry out higher mathematics is certainly constrained to such students, what I do not feel is limited is the ability to show the qualitative reasoning &lt;i&gt;behind&lt;/i&gt; the math. Even the concepts of calculus aren't beyond the capabilities of students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To give an example: In the lab I taught at KU, we had an assignment in which students were required to measure the position the sun set along the horizon throughout the semester (ie, the azimuthal angle). One of the questions we required students to address was "When was the rate of change the fastest?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To those that have taken a calculus course, the answer is instantly obvious: the highest rate of change is the point on the graph with the steepest slope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While, as an instructor, I can point this out to students and they'll swallow it, the point becomes even more convincing when a bit of dimensional analysis is performed and I demonstrate that the slope of the graph does indeed give the correct units for the rate of change!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, I feel that, even if an important equation is, in a quantitative sense, too difficult for a student, we should at least approach it qualitatively, and then do the quantitative bits for them. In other words, the instructor should solve the equation for the given lab so that students (once they understand what the equation is doing) may simply plug in the necessary numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This alleviates the problem I have presented; Instead of telling students that there is error and doing vague hand waving claiming it's "friction" or other ways of sidestepping it, it lets students know that, in real science, not only do we consider the error in our techniques, we can even say &lt;i&gt;how much&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is, of course, another, probably simpler solution: Get rid of labs with such high inherent errors. Instead, find labs that can be easily constructed with minimal tools that still result in high accuracy measurements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My favorite lab I've seen along this line is one involving measuring the speed of light with nothing more than a bag of chocolate chips, a microwave and a ruler. I've done the experiment myself and even gone through complete error analysis. The result I got for it had less than a 1% error and fell, within significant digits and the error bars, right on top of the canonical values of the speed of light!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now why didn't I ever do this in high school?&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8830519187158883554?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238786424473"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6620">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9197eb1b450af9a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 4.3</title><published>2009-04-03T19:00:56Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T19:00:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6620" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m waiting for the day when I don’t have to work anymore. I just hope that day doesn’t come courtesy of a coma or a forced stay in the boobie hatch or something similarly unfortunate. It would be much more fun if I sold one of my novels and it became a best-seller, allowing me then to keep a J.D. Salinger-esque schedule while drinking up my royalties and chasing college girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’m working at a job that I like but that still leaves room for daydreams of leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you ever see yourself as a person of leisure? If so, how would you spend your days if you didn’t have to work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you are already a person of leisure, here’s a puzzle to help fill your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope this puzzle will be fun&lt;br&gt;
Find seven answers not just one&lt;br&gt;
The first sees giants on common ground&lt;br&gt;
The next describes things always around&lt;br&gt;
The third is an ungrounded matter of race&lt;br&gt;
And the next it keeps you in your place&lt;br&gt;
Number five means to designate&lt;br&gt;
And six of diamonds can seal your fate&lt;br&gt;
The last, they may end the puzzle or&lt;br&gt;
Finalize a bigger score&lt;br&gt;
Now if you’ve solved these riddles fast&lt;br&gt;
List your answers first to last&lt;br&gt;
Be sure what crosses is also down&lt;br&gt;
And become a puzzler of renown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238786112702"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/03/iowa-lets-people-get-married/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76ec524d778f2b30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Iowa lets people get married</title><published>2009-04-03T19:00:49Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T19:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/03/iowa-lets-people-get-married/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, I get wrapped up in my own personal world for a coupla days, and find out &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/03/iowa.same.sex/index.html"&gt;I almost missed this&lt;/a&gt;: the Iowa Supreme Court said that banning gay people from getting married is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iowa?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perfectly correct. I’d add &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot;, but some folks don’t get it. But it really is simple. We have two choices, legally: allow &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; consenting adults to be legally married, or allow &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt;. This is because there’s a difference between being married legally — in the eyes of the law — and being married religiously. If your established religion hates teh ghey, then (besides that being your loss) don’t allow them to marry within that religion. But the State has no legal right to tell people to be married or not. So if it allows consenting oppositely-polarized heterosexual couples to be married and exact benefits from it, then they cannot consistently bar &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; two consenting adults, heterosexual or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we make laws barring one kind of marriage or another, we’re pussyfooting around the actual problem: some people are ooked out by gays. If that’s you, well, then, that’s you. You are what you are (though you can also strive to be more). But just because you’re personally uncomfortable with it, doesn’t mean a) it’s wrong, and/or b) it should be illegal. I think &amp;quot;reality shows&amp;quot; are an abomination upon our society, but I don’t think they should be illegal, and I’ll pit my abhorrence for them against anyone else’s homophobia any day. At least mine is based on critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone sees it this way. My irony gland nearly detonated upon reading this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s, quite frankly, a disaster,” said Brian English, a spokesman for the Iowa Family Policy Center, a nonprofit research and educational organization committed to strengthening the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ironic, you see, because he’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really committed to strengthening the family. He’s committed to weakening &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; families (and you can see this for yourself by &lt;a href="http://www.ifpc.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;going to their website&lt;/a&gt;). And we know those gay couples really are families. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn BarbouRoske told the group, “We’re proud that our kids will be able to grow up knowing their family is respected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her daughter added: “Hi, I’m McKinley, and I’m really, really happy. I feel that my family has always had this right, and today it is true. No longer shall we be just people who aren’t allowed to be married. We are able to get married.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has a daughter? Hey, so do I! And I know I have a family, so hers sounds like a family to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe I have to point stuff out like this sometimes, but the very existence of that &amp;quot;Family Policy&amp;quot; group shows that it needs to be pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I congratulate the canny and wise decision of the Iowa court, and tell the folks who live in the Hawkeye state to in fact keep their eyes open: there is already talk of trying to push through an amendment to make gay marriage illegal, since that’s voted upon by the people. So Iowans, perhaps the choice will be up to you. Will you think critically and do the right thing, or will you let your hearts and minds be closed on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238785816793"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=7431">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/017a20275475de86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="airlines"/><title type="html">Cellphone Calls Fail to Crash Airplanes</title><published>2009-04-03T18:40:25Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T18:40:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/n9A_CJ9boe0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/cellphone-calls-fail-to-crash-airplanes/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I've &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/airplane-"&gt;long squawked&lt;/a&gt; about how ridiculous the airline "safety" rules and procedures are.

&lt;p&gt;Every year on April 1st, the JREF gives out the Pigasus awards; a dubious honor to people or organizations that have done their best in the past year to snuff out science and promote irrationality. Randi talks about the 2008 winners, who receive no plaques, trophies, or banners: just the knowledge that they're getting publicity... but probably not the kind they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you communicate the most important idea in biology, and one of the most controversial ideas in our society, in a mere 120 seconds? Think you can convince even the most hard-headed creationist that Darwin was right? If so, show us--and that creationist--how it's done.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your task is to create a video of no more than two minutes that will get the idea and significance of evolution across to an educated lay audience. Along the way, you can touch on points like how evolution works, how we know it to be true, the evolution of humanity, and the future of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've done this before, with &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/twominutesorless"&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see examples. You've got until 1 June to come up with a scintillating and creative lesson in evolution, so get cracking!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/a_video_contest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Kjn3K5Po9tg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238779417156"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/end_game_for_awareness">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1090dc323aee88b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">End Game for Awareness?</title><published>2009-04-03T17:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T17:22:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/end_game_for_awareness" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hikingartist/3000884576/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/3000884576_f08564a361_m.jpg" alt="drawing of two goldfish in bowl, one is pointing to an butcher paper sign that says &amp;#39;strategy&amp;#39; on it with arrows that point to each other in a continuous circle. the fish with the pointer is grinning, the other fish is not" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the Examiner, Lisa Jo Rudy asks, &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-2007-Autism--Parenting-Examiner~y2009m3d25-Autism-awareness-can-there-be-too-much"&gt;Autism awareness: can there be too much?&lt;/a&gt; questioning whether we've done enough awareness, and whether there is such a thing as too much.  Rudy concludes, "At a certain point, I think we've done the work of building autism awareness.  The next challenge is tougher: building the infrastructure, acceptance and support we need to help our autistic loved ones live their lives fully - and happily."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudy's recent blog post made me immediately recall an article I read last year around this time.  The article was not written by the usual someone-engaged-in-"autism advocacy" in any sense of the phrase, but by a member of the general public.  This is someone who wasn't, theoretically, "aware" of autism before being "made aware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Jamison who wrote the piece &lt;a href="http://www.retrieverweekly.com/?module=displaystory&amp;amp;story_id=3275&amp;amp;format=html"&gt;Autism hyperbole and national hysteria&lt;/a&gt; basically echoed Rudy's question, with more than a little justified irritation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know autism exists; give us something we can work with. If the autism front wants to put us through a year of sappy ads and TV specials, than at least make it worth the time and money and headache. Teach us something. I was on my way to New York City this weekend and every toll booth was littered with autism propaganda. Did I learn anything? No. There are more intelligent ways to get out a message to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, do we really need a national concern at the moment? We have the war, the economy, the fuel crisis, and "The Office" is back with new episodes. My schedule is booked. Autism should save their money and put it towards research, or get the kids some Pokemon cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely a time when no one had really heard of autism.  And there definitely were enormous problems with that.  But that time, as a quick google for the "the A word" attests, is long past.  The public's attention has definitely been engaged.  Now are we going to use that productively to improve the quality of life of autistic people and their families, or just wait for the public to get (justifiably) irritated at hearing the same messages repeated over and over?  Is there something new the public can learn from "awareness" or have they heard it all before?  Even if there is little concern over &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/getting_off_the_pity_pot"&gt;the damage pity messages can do&lt;/a&gt; to autistic and other disabled people, there should at least be some questioning of whether there is an end game to the "awareness" at all other than saturation, irritation, and ultimately polarity and hostility.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238779387267"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3511228733216194011">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe08a7059e90330e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">James Lunney: Creationist, Chiropractor, Conservative</title><published>2009-04-03T17:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T17:22:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/james-lunney-creationist-chiropractor.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3511228733216194011/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3511228733216194011" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Meet Dr. James Lunney a chiropractor and a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Nanaimo-Alberni in British Columbia.&amp;quot;Dr.&amp;quot; Lunney recently made a fool of himself by making the following statement in the House of Commons as reported in Maclean&amp;#39;s magazine [James Lunney v.

That wasn’t true at first, of course. Our minds were curious, our telescopes got better, and then our ability to program computers with equations really helped us leap-frog ahead. Now we can observe objects, feed their parameters into computers programmed with the physics, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, we understand star formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars form in clouds of gas. The cloud is sitting there, its gravity balanced by pressure, until something happens to upset that balance. The cloud collapses, and stars form in various parts of it. But what are those &amp;quot;somethings&amp;quot; that happen? Well, clouds can collide with each other, for one, or a nearby supernova can slam them with high speed ejecta that can also trigger collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/interactive/star-formation-game/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/starformationgame.jpg" alt="Star formation game screen shot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even cooler? Now you can see this for yourself with &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/interactive/star-formation-game/"&gt;The Star Formation Game&lt;/a&gt;! In this game, commissioned by &lt;del&gt;The Hive Overmind&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine, you start with a gas cloud, and click where you want to detonate supernovae, corralling the gas. Do it right, form stars, and you move to the next level. Do it wrong, and the cloud dissipates, and you fail in your godlike powers of birth and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was crafted with the help of astronomer Adam Frank, &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/26-violent-mysterious-dynamics-of-star-formation"&gt;who also wrote a companion piece to it&lt;/a&gt;. It’s actually a fun game, and just to let you know, I suck at it. I can’t seem to break 1000, but clearly there are ways to rack up lots more points.

&lt;p&gt;I had to look up the population density in my area…it&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;18&lt;/i&gt;. Not 18 thousand, just 18. When I plug that number into the formula, I got a value of 4,500 meters, almost 3 miles. The parents of our students will find that a reassuring statistic, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the formula lacks a temporal component — that mean distance is going to vary with a circadian rhythm, I would think, with peaks in the evening and early morning hours. Rather than a static number, it should be a function that measures a kind of hourly flux, with all the sexy time people hovering in close around dusk and receding during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.

Former Liberal governments have created powerful tools to reinvigorate public research: the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Canada Research Chairs Program, Genome Canada and the Indirect Costs Program for Canada’s colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Conservative governments’ recent budget demonstrates its failure to grasp the importance of scientific research for creating the jobs of tomorrow. Three national research granting councils, which play essential roles in funding the scientists who conduct the research, will be subjected to “efficiency and focusing” cuts over the next three years. Equally disturbing, the budget failed to provide Genome Canada with new funding, obstructing the multi-year process of engaging talented Canadian scientists and private-sector partners in the next research cycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be assured that the Liberal Party will work relentlessly to push this government into making long-term commitments to science, research and innovation. We will raise this issue in the House of Commons, pressuring the government to send a clear message that our country is in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By allowing our scientists to make long term plans government sends the signal that it really does believe in what they are doing, and, more importantly, that it understand the nature of their work. Long term, predictable support provides our scientists with the tools they need to do their work. It also communicates that we want our scientists to stay in Canada, and, moreover, that we want scientists from the rest of the world to come here to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This support must extend to all forms of research – engineering and natural sciences, medicine and life sciences, the humanities and social sciences. It is not appropriate for government to impose constraints on which forms of research are more likely to be funded. Such a policy – valuing applied science over fundamental science that has less obvious commercial value – is shortsighted and wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you again for sharing your views on this important matter.&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Office of the Leader of the Opposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-6761603129289309106?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/Zu02-a78I1I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238774951589"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-198357754800531958">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e96f7bfa3336fba4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Don't Leave Canada Behind.</title><published>2009-04-03T11:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T11:28:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/hcQZmOtqmb0/dont-leave-canada-behind.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=198357754800531958" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/04/dont-leave-canada-behind.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">I mentioned the message I received about the Don't Leave Canada Behind campaign in an earlier &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-letter-dont-leave-canada-behind.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Our account had been suspended by YouTube due to some copyright complaints on a handful of videos we had uploaded. The videos in question have been removed, the proper hoops have been jumped through, and YouTube restored the account. We are currently going though our inventory to make sure any videos that we even &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; might be in violation are removed. There are 200+ of them, so it'll take us some time, but we're on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all our supporters once again for the outcry when this happened. But I'll also gently chide some of you: there were many rumors, accusations, and conclusions jumped-to when our account was taken down. As you can see, no one was attacking us, and no one acted unfairly - the complainants were within their rights, and YouTube acted according to their rules. In fact, when we started conversing with one of the complainants and with YouTube, everyone acted in a civilized and even friendly manner. The matter was resolved quickly and, I think, to everyone's satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I'd like to personally thank everyone involved with this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're back on the air! You can expect to see more Randi Speaks soon, as well as our usual skeptical take on all things unskeptical.

The state south of us: rural farm country, relatively conservative (well, maybe more moderate than conservative), and yet their supreme court has surprisingly made a strong and progressive decision. &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/03/iowa.same.sex/index.html"&gt;The Iowa Supreme Court has struck down laws prohibiting gay marriage as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polk County District Judge Robert Hanson found that the law violated the Iowa Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, and hurt gay and lesbian couples "in numerous tangible and intangible" ways
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Civil marriage in Iowa is the only gateway to an extensive legal structure that protects a married couple's relationship and family in and outside the state," Hanson ruled in Des Moines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Iowa reserves an unparalleled array of rights, obligations and benefits to married couples and their families, privileging married couples as a financial and legal unit and stigmatizing same-sex couples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. I am impressed with our neighboring state. Can we get this kind of sensible support for equality in place here in Minnesota, too?

Of course, none of those other countries are entirely exempt from having dumbasses pontificating on science, so we can still occasionally take a cheap, desperate shot at some furrin&amp;#39; loon. Here&amp;#39;s a Canadian who has done his part to bolster American egos: &lt;a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/04/02/james-lunney-v-science/"&gt;James Lunney, conservative member of parliament&lt;/a&gt;. Take it away, Mr Lunney!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Speaker, recently we saw an attempt to ridicule the presumed beliefs of a member of this House and the belief of millions of Canadians in a creator. Certain individuals in the media and the scientific community have exposed their own arrogance and intolerance of beliefs contrary to their own. Any scientist who declares that the theory of evolution is a fact has already abandoned the foundations of science. For science establishes fact through the study of things observable and reproducible. Since origins can neither be reproduced nor observed, they remain the realm of hypothesis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In science, it is perfectly acceptable to make assumptions when we do not have all the facts, but it is never acceptable to forget our assumptions. Given the modern evidence unavailable to Darwin, advanced models of plate techtonics, polonium radiohalos, polystratic fossils, I am prepared to believe that Darwin would be willing to re-examine his assumptions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The evolutionists may disagree, but neither can produce Darwin as a witness to prove his point. The evolutionists may genuinely see his ancestor in a monkey, but many modern scientists interpret the same evidence in favour of creation and a creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressive effort, Lunney. It takes great ignorance to pack so many fallacies into 3 paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of evolution are reproducible and observable. We can even observe the historical specifics of contingent evolutionary events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lunney's choices of objections, &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD750.html"&gt;plate techtonics [sic]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF201.html"&gt;polonium radiohalos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC331.html"&gt;polystratic[sic] fossils&lt;/a&gt;, reveal that he has read the erroneous creationist literature, but has never examined the scientific debunkings of his claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard this claim that creationists use the same evidence to argue for creation. It is not true. They select a narrow subset of the evidence that superficially supports their claims, and then ignore the broader array of evidence that completely undermines them…as, for example, creationists who claim that plate tectonics, polonious halos, and polystrate trees refute evolution. There is more evidence out there than the tiny fraction that creationists choose to highlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/not_so_smug_now_are_you_canada.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6cbEKSJN-R4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238773241939"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/friday_sprog_blogging_chatting.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/013389395c542c44</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kids and science"/><title type="html">Friday Sprog Blogging: chatting about math.</title><published>2009-04-03T16:27:56Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T16:27:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/_UeOItXYiLk/friday_sprog_blogging_chatting.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/04/friday_sprog_blogging_chatting.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we're trying to get out of town for the weekend, Casa Free-Ride is a hive of activity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what’s happening was predicted in the mid-1990s, when the World Wide Web burst onto the public consciousness. But people were also saying a lot of retrospectively ludicrous Internet-related things — e.g., that the business cycle had been abolished, and that vast profits could be made selling pet food online. Newspapers emerged from the dot-com bubble relatively unscathed and probably felt pretty good about their future. Now it turns out that the Internet bomb was real — it just had a 15-year fuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities were also subject to a lot of fevered speculation back then. In 1997 the legendary management consultant Peter Drucker said, “Thirty years from now, the big university campuses will be relics…. Such totally uncontrollable expenditures, without any visible improvement in either the content or the quality of education, means that the system is rapidly becoming untenable.” Twelve years later, universities are bursting with customers, bigger, and (until recently) richer than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But universities have their own weak point, their own vulnerable cash cow: lower-division undergraduate education. The math is pretty simple: Multiply an institution’s average net tuition (plus any state subsidies) by the number of students (say, 200) in a freshman lecture course. Subtract whatever the beleaguered adjunct lecturer teaching the course is being paid. I don’t care what kind of confiscatory indirect-cost multiplier you care to add to that equation, the institution is making a lot of money — which is then used to pay for faculty scholarship, graduate education, administrative salaries, the football coach, and other expensive things that cost more than they bring in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I buy it.  Let’s think about what good purposes a college or university might serve.  Off the top of my head, I can think of several:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classroom-based education.&lt;/strong&gt;  Certainly important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracurricular learning.&lt;/strong&gt;  This includes everything from “participating in actual academic research” to “serving on the school newspaper.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting different kinds of people.&lt;/strong&gt;  Not only do students get exposed to professors, and an academic way of thinking about problems, but they also meet other students, hopefully from a wide variety of backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing independence.&lt;/strong&gt;  For many people, going to college is the first time one lives away from home, and begins to establish an identity separate from one’s family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belonging to a community.&lt;/strong&gt;  From the university itself to numerous smaller subcultures within, college provides an opportunity to belong.  As great as the &lt;a href="http://www.teach12.com/"&gt;Teaching Company&lt;/a&gt; is, it doesn’t have &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/clubhouse?teamId=222"&gt;a basketball team in the Final Four.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to add your own.  We can argue whether online learning can be effective in replacing the first of these — after all, hearing a recorded lecture is not the same as hearing it live.  But it would appear very difficult to replace the others.  The four years one spends at college are often the most formative (and perhaps the most enjoyable) years of one’s life.   It’s not clear, of course, how much people are willing to &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; for those other purposes, as important as they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is a long-established bargain at big research universities that could conceivably come unraveled at the hands of the internet.  Namely:  it is research and scholarship that attracts the faculty and establishes the academic reputation of a school, but it is teaching that brings in students and tuition dollars.  This is not an arrangement based entirely on avarice; the top research schools bring in a lot more money from grants and gifts than they do from student tuitions.  But it reflects a deep philosophical split, that might signal an underlying instability:  from within academia, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/05/29/the-purpose-of-harvard-is-not-to-educate-people/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of the university is seen as the production of new scholarship&lt;/a&gt;; from outside academia, the purpose of universities is seen as the teaching of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of newspapers, the internet made it harder to tightly bundle straightforward news with advertising and sections of the paper any one reader might not be interested in.  In the case of universities, will the internet make it harder to bundle teaching and research?  Quick, name the largest private university in the U.S.  The answer is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Phoenix"&gt;University of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1976, where 95% of faculty are part-time and the large majority of teaching happens completely online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could happen that more education-providing corporations (one hesitates to call them “universities”) could develop better ways to provide online classroom educations to a large number of students who are interested in the first purpose listed above but are unwilling to pay for the second.  If that model catches on, it will cause dramatic upheaval in the economy of traditional universities.  And, much as I love the internet, that would be too bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they found is called a Gromia Sphaerica; a giant single-celled protozoan the size of a grape. These distant relatives of microscopic amoebas were originally discovered in 2000 at the bottom of Arabian sea. One of their more bizarre attributes is that they are surrounded by a squishy shell called a test. The test in turn is filled mostly with stercomata. Ever hear of stercomata? I hadn’t. It’s um…….it’s basically crap. Ugly bags of mostly crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/bigcell2.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="249"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fascinating as all that is, it’s not the meat of this story. When Matz found his posse of protozoans in the Bahamas, they were all resting at the end of a grooves or tracks in the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracks schmacks right?…The big deal is that single-celled organisms aren’t supposed to make tracks. The long-belief has always been that only multi-cellular life could create tracks including the many known fossilized tracks (called “trace fossils”) made millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding this Matz has said:&lt;br&gt;
“If these guys were alive 600 million years ago, and their traces got fossilized, a paleontologist who had never seen this thing would not have a shade of doubt attributing this kind of trace to the activity of a big, multicellular, bilaterally symmetrical animal,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that multi-cellular life made tracks like this made sense to paleontologists because it made the Cambrian Explosion a little more palatable, a little less……explosive. The famous Cambrian Explosion  refers to a relatively brief (geologically) period of time over 500 million years ago when most of the body plans used by life today were introduced to the world. It was a unique period in evolutionary history that saw such diversification and rapid niche-filling that Darwin himself assumed that it must be an artifact of an incomplete fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the apparently dull and simple pre-cambrian period had complicated life in it leaving tracks all over the place, then that would show that the stage was being set for the coming Cambrian explosion. It was just hard to notice because the multi-cellular life that existed then hadn’t evolved the nice hard parts that fossilized so nicely and made the coming explosion seem so sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/gromiatrack.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="277"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If simple little grape-sized amoebas could make these tracks then we really have no solid evidence that the pre-cambrian wasn’t simple and boring. This makes the Cambrian even more interesting and special in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz then had to go and say this:&lt;br&gt;
“It wasn’t a gradual development of complexity,…Instead these things suddenly seemed to burst out of a magic box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, this guy Matz seems like a nice guy and he probably made a cool discovery here but did he have to say “MAGIC BOX”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, McFly!&lt;br&gt;
Talk about giving creationists a freebie. That was really a naïve statement to make considering how easy it is to misinterpret and quote out of context. In fact I found a few anti-evolution websites that jumped all over it.&lt;br&gt;
One of &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2008/11/29/news-to-note-11292008"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; printed Matz’s quote and then commented with just 3 words: “Need we elaborate”.&lt;/p&gt;

That's the beauty of it. I've never heard of it before, but a little Googling brought me evidence that it may not be a parody, that the guy purveying it may actually believe it. I'll leave you to judge for yourself, or, if you've heard of this guy before, to chime in and let me know the deal. I'll also point out that parts of this website are not entirely safe for work. Actually, a couple of the pages are not safe for work at all. Don't worry, I don't plan on directly linking to any those pages, but you could hit a link while exploring the site and accidentally find yourself looking at something you really don't want to. Trust me on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what woo it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you ever heard of &lt;a href="http://www.happehtheory.com"&gt;Happeh Theory&lt;/a&gt;? You haven't? Well, you have now! Suffice it to say that Happeh Theory has an odd obsession. More about that later. First, it starts out a lot like any other run-of-the-mill woo site, only with cheesier graphics. Specifically, Happeh Theory seems to think that we all have "energy bodies" that are in essence &lt;a href="http://www.happehtheory.com/Energy/HumanBeingsHaveEnergyMainPage.htm"&gt;duplicates of our own body&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Treating the energy body of a human being as an exact duplicate of the physical body can be especially helpful in discussing the movement of the energy body from it's proper location and orientation on the physical body.

&lt;p&gt;The reason why knowing if the energy body has moved away from it's proper location and orientation on the physical body is important, is that any movement of the energy body away from it's proper orientation or location is usually associated with the development of some type of health problem, and because the exact way in which the energy body has moved, will provide insight into how the physical body of the individual moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, there is "intent":&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_worldwide_wa.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_worldwide_wa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/39PIAIQIiio" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238767057075"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=511">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1aed98a7ab3e754a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><title type="html">Mammoths and Nanodiamonds</title><published>2009-04-03T13:39:59Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T13:39:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=511" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a story of the very big and the very small, but more importantly it is an interesting story of how scientists resolve different ideas with research and evidence. I have been following it for years and love to read about new updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burning question is - what happened to the mammoths and other megafauna of North America about 13,000 years ago. Extinction itself is no big deal - most species that have ever lived are extinct, and all species go extinct eventually (at least so far). But this was somewhat of a mass extinction - a continent-wide extinction of large terrestrial mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theories as to the cause include overhunting by newly arrived human populations, climate change brought on by the transition from the recent glacial period to the current inter-glacial period, and (more recently) the impact of a large comet somewhere over Canada. It seems that overhunting likely was a factor, but not enough by itself to explain the loss of megafauna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at present the two main contenders are climate change vs impact. Recently the PBS program, &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/401/3"&gt;NOVA, showed its new special on the conterversy&lt;/a&gt; before an audience of scientists. The program made the case for the impact theory, and revealed some new evidence. Scientists skeptical of the impact theory remain skeptical, however, indicating that this controversy is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nanodiamonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new evidence revealed in the program is the discovery of nanodiamonds from a 12,900 year old layer of glacial ice in Greenland.  Nanodiamonds are exactly what they sound like - nanometer sized diamonds. They are formed under high temperature and pressure, such as would be present in a meteor or comet impact. They have been found in meteorites. Supporters of the impact theory point to nanodiamonds as a major source of evidence. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090101172136.htm"&gt;Researchers have found nanodiamonds&lt;/a&gt; from multiple North American sites all dating from12,900 years ago. This North America-wide sediment layer of nanodiamonds is the same kind of evidence as the world-wide layer of iridium 65.5 million years ago is evidence for an impact leading to the mass extinction that claimed the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics, however, charge that the nanodiamonds are not definitively of impact origin (where as the iridium layer at the K-T boundry is clearly an extraterrestrial isotope). They argue that the nanodiamonds could have been produced by earth-bound processes and simply been deposited in those sediment layers where they are found. Or, nandiamonds raining down in micrometeorites could have simply collected in the layers detected. They may be concentrated in a layer because the retreat of the glaciers caused large lake formations, or some similar cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the new Greenland evidence come into play. Researchers found nanodiamonds in a 12,900 year old layer of glacial ice. This would be expected from the impact hypothesis, but is difficult to explain with the sedimenting hypothesis. That is, in fact, exactly why they looked there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other side is not ready to give up yet. Mineralogist Bevan French of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. is quoted as saying: “I still don’t think nanodiamonds by themselves are a signature for extraterrestrial material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other lines of evidence that appear to contradict the impact theory. This is often how good science works - using multiple independent lines of evidence to triangulate to the most likely answer. In this case Dr Sandy Harrison from the University of Bristol and colleagues  looked at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090126173729.htm"&gt;evidence for large forest fires in North America&lt;/a&gt; from 15,000-10,000 years ago. What they found was evidence for scattered fires, but no continent wide forest fire event 12,900 years ago, as would be predicted by the impact theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many researchers blame the Younger Dryas for the mass extinctions. This was a 1,300 year period of cooling following the warming that occured at the end of the most recent glacial period. The exact cause is unknown, but one theory is that fresh water from glacial melting dumped into the North Atlantic and shut down the salt-driven oceanic currents. But regardless of the cause, this was a period of rapid climate change - perhaps too rapid for wildlife to respond, hence the extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have are apparently contradictory lines of evidence - nanodiamonds suggest an impact, while the absence of continent-wide forest fires argues against an impact.  This controversy, however, will be resolved with evidence. There are specific questions that need to be answered - Can nanodiamonds be created on earth, or are their only origin meteorites and impacts? Will the nanodiamond layer evidence hold up under further investigation? Why isn’t there evidence for extensive forest fires at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, one bit of missing evidence is a large-enough impact crater in North America from 12,900 years ago. Impact theorists argue that a comet could have exploded above the ground (like with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event"&gt;Tunguska event&lt;/a&gt; of 1908), which is plausible - but this can also just be an excuse for the absence of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers will continue to argue their respective cases, while they think about new predictions that flow from the various theories. They will then test those predictions, and over time one theory will slowly win out over the competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like science is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

It's usually worth looking at most of them because they'll either be interesting or really, really bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, the motorcycle safety one wasn't really either; it had a bunch of good general advice for keeping safe on a motorcycle, but mixed in with it was a bad, scare-tactic statistic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's what it said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indiana Statistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;108 motorcycle fatalities reported in 2004--only 25.7% of these riders were wearing a helmet whereas 74.3% were not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the surface, this is a rather chilling statistic: more of 2004's deaths were sans helmet than with helmet. Unfortunately, it tells us next to nothing about the relative safety of riding your bike with a helmet vs. without one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To provide a really useful measurement of the effect of helmets on fatality rate, the numbers cannot be limited to just the fatalities; if you don't look at &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; motorcycle accidents within a given period, you won't have the complete picture. The useful number isn't what percentage of fatalities involved helmets; that's something, I suppose, but it doesn't really tell the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the poster-makers &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; have done is looked at the total number of accidents that happened to motorcyclists who were wearing helmets (Group A, let's call them) and the total number that happened to motorcyclists not wearing helmets (Group 2, just for shits and giggles). They then should have figured the percentage of fatalities in Group A accidents and the percentage of fatalities in Group 2 accidents, and compared &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; percentages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a reckoning would show the risk of fatality from an accident while wearing a helmet vs. the risk of fatality from an accident while &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; wearing a helmet. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is the useful comparison in this situation; that tells you how much safer you are from death with a helmet than without one. The number they used was just "This number is bigger than the other number! Be afraid!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't doubt that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; safer to wear a helmet than not. I'd just like to see a useful statistic that really shows that difference rather than a far-less-useful scare tactic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while we're on this subject, I'm always hearing the vague statistic that you're more likely to die in a motorcycle accident than a car accident. While this is another claim that, on the face of it, I don't doubt (bikes have no protective chassis, you can fly right off of one, etc.), it is usually presented without real numbers in the hope that it will scare you out of riding a motorcycle. Not only that, it also suffers from the same problem as the first one: it doesn't tell the whole story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying one is more likely to die in a motorcycle accident than a car accident carries the an unstated premise: "&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; you get into an accident on a motorcycle." The conclusion is then "You're more likely to die than if you had gotten into an accident in a car." Again, I don't doubt this, but barring the greater picture, it is only useful as a scare tactic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole picture would involve all vehicles on the road, by necessity. You'd first have to look at the risk of getting into a motorcycle accident &lt;i&gt;in the first place&lt;/i&gt;, and multiply that percentage by the percentage of motorcycle accidents that end in death. So, and I'm just going to make up some numbers here, say that 5% of motorcyclists get into accidents, and 40% of motorcycle accidents are fatal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means your chance of getting into an accident while riding a motorcycle is .05. &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; that .05 chance crops up, then your chance of dying is .4. But the overall chance of dying while riding a motorcycle (which represents the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; likelihood of motorcycle-related fatality) is .02, or 2%. Why? Because you only have a 5% chance of getting into an accident in the first place, and accidental fatalities are a 40% subset of accidents, so the overall chance of death-by-motorcycle-accident is only at 2%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even that's not the &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt; picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you'd run the exact same numbers for cars. Say, at the end, you came up with an absolute probability of .5% that you'd die in a fatal car accident then, yes, it is fair to say that you're more likely to die in a bike accident than in a car accident. On the other hand, if the numbers work out equally, or (and I do think this is unlikely) there's a higher absolute probability of dying in a car crash, then the claim is bunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's why you can't simply compare fatality percentages of car accidents that happened vs. motorcycle accidents that happened. The actual chance of getting into a wreck in the first place affects the outcome, possibly in a non-trivial way. It's a confounding variable that's simply being ignored to get the scarier statistic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like common sense that riding a motorcycle is probably more dangerous than driving a car; it also seems like common sense that riding a motorcycle with a helmet is probably more dangerous than riding without one. But the popular statistics I see bandied about do not accurately represent what's really going on, and in doing so they present a false picture of the danger of motorcycling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anybody can find some useful statistics to that end (or thinks that my reckoning is bullshit; I'm hardly a statistician, after all), please feel free to comment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-4934611265752172602?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238763988612"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/friday_cephalopod_that_cold_bl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/433fca452a7255dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: That cold blue eye…</title><published>2009-04-03T11:10:29Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T11:10:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ELrBoiwoB5Y/friday_cephalopod_that_cold_bl.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/friday_cephalopod_that_cold_bl.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/vampyroteuthis_infernalis.jpeg" width="450" height="233" alt="vampyroteuthis_infernalis.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here's an excerpt.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finds and radiocarbon dates allow us to identify five phases on-site, two of them corresponding to the dates of the metal detector finds that occasioned the excavations.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late Mesolithic: finds and features with one radiocarbon date.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle/Late Neolithic: one hearth with a radiocarbon date, no finds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mid-1st Millennium AD: a pit and a hearth with two radiocarbon dates, no finds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viking Period: one posthole with a radiocarbon date, no finds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern rubbish pits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late Mesolithic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase is identified by a radiocarbon date and a collection of lithics, mainly knapped quartz with some leptite, ultramylonite and basalt, but no pottery and no flint. The only well-defined tool is a ground-surface asymmetrical basalt adze (F220) with a quasi-rectangular cross-section, found on the surface of the field during stripping. After separate first-hand study, Stone Age specialists Fredrik Molin and Roger Wikell unanimously placed the assemblage in the Late Mesolithic (5500-4000 cal BC), noting that the adze would look entirely at home among the abundant finds from the Strandvägen settlement site in Motala (cf. Tom Carlsson 2008, &lt;i&gt;Where the River Bends&lt;/i&gt;, pp. 232-245, 374-379). This date is consistent with the level above the sea and the absence of Neolithic pottery. None of the finds can certainly be determined as shore-abraded after knapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Stone Age finds occurred singly in the fills of sunken features that looked no different than usual. Only pits 124, 128 and 154 yielded more than one piece of knapped stone each, suggesting that they may have been Stone Age features. Radiocarbon-dating 128 and 154 would have been problematic as both showed signs of modern disturbance. This left only 124, but it yielded no charcoal. Hearth 45 however, which contained no other artefacts, yielded charcoal of rotten oakwood that was dated to 4460-4340 cal BC with 95% probability (Ua-37499, 5560±40 BP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found raw material in the form of unmodified quartz seashore pebbles in some features and collected them when they co-occurred with knapped stone. They are very unlike the typical gravel mixed in the fills and natural on site. In several cases, very small quartz pebbles have been used for knapping or simply broken open and then discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an appendix, Fredrik Molin analyses the lithics and summarises his impressions as follows (and I translate):&lt;blockquote&gt; "The adze, the signs of micro-blade production, and possibly the use of leptite and ultramylonite all suggest a Late Mesolithic date. Nothing however excludes an Early Neolithic date except the absence of pottery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the quartz cannot be dated. But to my mind it appears too coarsely knapped for the Early or Middle Mesolithic - and such a date can be ruled out anyway because of shoreline displacement. Quartz knapping [in Östergötland] becomes progressively coarser and uglier with time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle/Late Neolithic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature 123, whose functional interpretation as a hearth was uncertain, yielded hazel charcoal that was dated to 2460-2270 cal BC at 79% probability (Ua-37500, 3855±35 BP). The interval straddles the Middle/Late Neolithic period shift at 2350 cal BC. A shore site from this era might be expected to yield some Late Pitted Ware decorated pottery, of which we found none. Fredrik Svanberg (web log comment, 20 March 2009) has suggested that the sample may have been contaminated, possibly combining material from the site's Mesolithic and Iron Age components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-1st Millennium AD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Early Vendel Period, the later 6th century, is the site's heyday in terms of the metal detector finds. We made no datable finds of this era during the excavations. Two sherds of black coarse &lt;em&gt;svartgods&lt;/em&gt; pottery are most parsimoniously allocated to this phase, though they may well be somewhat earlier or later. Pit 170 and hearth 135 yielded one radiocarbon date each, 170 on spruce-trunk charcoal in 320-440 cal AD (86% probability) and 135 on maple charcoal in 410-550 cal AD (95% probability). As none of the samples had a confirmed low intrinsic age, and as the site has not yielded a single piece of metalwork dating before the Migration Period, it seems safe to place the beginning of this activity phase in the 5th century AD. All pits and hearths on site that yielded no dating evidence are most parsimoniously placed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excavated surface yielded several datable pieces of metalwork from the ploughsoil but none from the sunken features, and there were no remains of building foundations. This suggests that in the 6th century, this particular part of the site saw some metalworking carried out in flimsy structures or outdoors. Any refuse pits and postholes resulting from this activity were apparently less deep than the modern ploughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viking Period&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an apparent hiatus of a century or more in the Late Vendel Period, there are at least six metal detector finds that can be dated to the Viking Period, AD 790-1100. This phase also shows up in a radiocarbon date from one of the excavation's few postholes, feature 8, where charcoal of rotten Scots pine was dated to 760-900 cal AD at 81% probability (Ua-37498, 1205±35 BP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Rubbish Pits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase gathers sunken features yielding modern artefacts, well-preserved bone (as soil conditions were very poor for such preservation), dynamited rock and/or a curious fine white sand. For unknown reasons, the sand had apparently been carted to site and used to fill four pits, two of which also contained modern finds. The artefact types found in the modern features were iron nails, iron wire, glass, pottery/china, roof tile, brick, fired clay and fresh wood. Modern activities that these features document are the burial of waste, the digging of a drainage ditch and the dynamiting of a few large boulders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/sattuna_fieldwork_report_neari.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/m7Q0BLwpPO0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238758157226"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1290">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8fa60ec1abd29535</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pragmatics"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Why "that would be me"?

(For background, see "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245"&gt;We've met the enemy, and that would be in the modal auxiliary, Bob&lt;/a&gt;" 3/18/2009, and "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1287"&gt;Why 'that would be me'? (part 1)&lt;/a&gt;" 4/2/2009.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/em&gt;, Chapter 3, The Verb, by Rodney Huddleston, covers "The preterite forms &lt;em&gt;could, might, would, should&lt;/em&gt;" in section 9.8, pp. 198-302. The section starts this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We have distinguished three uses of the preterite: past time, backshift, and modal remoteness. It is a distinctive property of the modal auxiliaries that the modal remoteness use is much more frequent and less restricted than the past time use — the complete reverse of what holds for other verbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;What do these three uses mean in the case of the modal auxiliary &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, according to CGEL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Past time &lt;em&gt;would. &lt;/em&gt;This use is typically associated with the senses of volition or propensity: "I had no money but he wouldn't lend me any"; "Whenever he heard her coming he would quickly put out his pipe".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Backshifted &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;. In a  characteristic example of backshifted &lt;em&gt;would, &lt;/em&gt;it corresponds to &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; in the complement of a past tense verb, e.g.  "I will see them soon" vs. "I knew I would see them soon".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Modal remoteness. Huddleston distinguishes two subcases of modal remoteness that are relevant to &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;: remote conditionals and tentativeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the tentative use first, since it corresponds to the notion of "doubt" that comes so easily to some people's minds in connection with &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;. This is a class of cases where "a rather vague element of tentativeness, diffidence, extra politeness, or the like" comes into play. Huddleston's examples include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;He'd be about sixty.&lt;br&gt;
Would you tell them we're here?&lt;br&gt;
… and, I would suggest, it&amp;#39;s too expensive anyway.&lt;br&gt;
They would appear to have gone without us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment on the last example is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; is a lexical modal of medium strength, qualifying my commitment to the truth of the modalised proposition: compare unmodalised &lt;em&gt;They have gone without us&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Would&lt;/em&gt; then adds further modal qualification, so that [the expression &lt;em&gt;would appear&lt;/em&gt;] provides a double hedge against being wrong. […] The same effect is found in &lt;em&gt;would seem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I would think&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Huddleston indicates, "tentative would" is a useful tool, and several particular versions of it are common. Perhaps these are the cases that lead some people to conclude that &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; is all about doubt. ("Tentativeness" seems to describe these examples better than "doubt" does, but the difference is a small one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as we'll see below, other uses of  &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, for instance those in what CGEL calls &amp;quot;remote conditionals&amp;quot;, are much more common than &amp;quot;tentative would&amp;quot; is. At least, they&amp;#39;re many times more frequent in all of the sorts of texts that I&amp;#39;ve looked at; and the divergence is especially great in the case of examples involving the fragment &amp;quot;That would be …&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to analyze these other uses of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, we need to go over CGEL's distinction between "remote" and "open" conditionals, discussed in section 14.2 of Chapter 8 ("The clause: adjuncts"). The basic idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The remote construction differs from the open in that it entertains the condition as being satisfied in a world which is potentially different from the actual world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, these examples deal with the evaluation of a hypothetical situation.  CGEL's terminology is better than the traditional "counterfactual conditional", because the world of a remote conditional is only potentially different from the actual world. And in fact, I think that the examples given in CGEL's treatment emphasis the unreal character of the remote-conditional world a bit too strongly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;OPEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;REMOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If he tells her she will be furious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If he told her she would be furious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If you are under 18 you need parental approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If you were under 18 you would need parental approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If he bought it at that price, he got a bargain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If he had bought it at that price, he would have got a bargain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the conditional schema [If P, Q] CGEL explains that &amp;quot;… the remote conditional, like the open, excludes the case where P is true and Q false&amp;quot;, but notes that remote conditions &amp;quot;where the time of the protasis situation is present or past&amp;quot;, remote conditionals &amp;quot;generally implicate that P is false, or at least likely to be. And by the only-if implicature Q will likewise be false, or probably false.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why such conditionals have traditionally been called "counter-factual". However, the explanation continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It is important to emphasise … that a present or past time remote conditional does not entail that P is false (in the actual world); this is why we spoke above of the condition being satisfied in a world which is &lt;strong&gt;potentially&lt;/strong&gt; different from the actual world. In the first place, it may well be that I don&amp;#39;t know whether P is true or false … Secondly, there is one use of the remote construction, not common but nevertheless clearly-established, where I know or am confident that P is in fact true:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;f he had escaped by jumping out of the window he would have left footprints in the flower-bed beneath. And that is precisely what happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I need to draw attention to a very common kind of &lt;em&gt;if P Q&lt;/em&gt; construction, left out of the CGEL discussion, where Q has &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; (or another preterite-form modal auxiliary) but there is no presumption at all that P is false — and the if-clause typically has a plain present verb form. Some examples from the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If you want a domestic SUV, then the best choice would be the Ford Escape Hybrid.&lt;br&gt;
If you want functional air filters, the best choice would have to be K&amp;amp;N Air Filter.&lt;br&gt;
…if you really want to use WMA, the best choice would be 2-pass encoding.&lt;br&gt;
If you really need a fighter bay, the best choice by far would be a manta bay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such sentences  discuss a hypothetical situation, created by laying out a disjunction that divides up  the space of circumstances affecting answer: If X, then A would be best; if Y, then B would be best; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very similar examples exist with present-tense forms of &lt;em&gt;to be:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… if you want real wood, the best choice is engineered flooring.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to stay in colonial Quito, the best choice is the Hotel Real Audiencia.&lt;br&gt;
If you want HD programming, Dish Network is the best choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these examples, the choice between &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t seem to make a great deal of difference. Perhaps the preterite emphasizes the hypothetical nature of the situation under discussion — but with respect to perceived speaker (un)certainty, perhaps the preterite makes the speaker seem more rather than less certain, by emphasizing that the logic of the hypothetical situation is being carefully evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this same sort of situationally-partitioned assertion can be expressed without any explicit if-clause. This might involve replacing the if-clause with a prepositional phrase or some other way to reference the hypothetical state of affairs under consideration, as in these web examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In that case, the best choice by far would be the Ruger.&lt;br&gt;
For VGA devices (640×480 screen) the best format would be XVID.&lt;br&gt;
My recommendation in DLP would be the Mitsubishi HC1500.&lt;br&gt;
In Standard Yiddish the word would be grubn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in other cases, the hypothetical situation — counter-factual or not — is set up in a question, and then assumed  in the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Q: I want to fly helios in the military what are the requirments and what is the best way to get there?&lt;br&gt;
A: [the] best way definitely would be to go warrant officer in the army.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Q: What exercise is best for muscle 1 type fibers?&lt;br&gt;
A: … the best way to train this type of muscle fiber would be with low intensity endurance type exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Q: What shampoo is best for oily hair?&lt;br&gt;
A: The best one I&amp;#39;ve found so far would be Tea Tree from Paul Mitchel… Another way for your hair not to be so oily would be to not use conditioner …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Q: What would earth be like without a moon?&lt;br&gt;
A: The most obvious difference would be that there would be no tides at shorelines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in other cases, the question is only implicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"The best solution &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt; be for us all to become vegetarians".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;So suggested the head of the UN climate agency, Yvo de Boer, who is attending UN-led climate talks in Germany this week. He was responding to criticism that measures to tackle climate change are partly to blame for the rise in food and energy costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Boer's statement answers an implicit question, perhaps something like "What should we do to deal with the hypothetical (and also actual) situation that some allegedly green energy measures, like ethanol from corn, raise food prices?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in President Obama's &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-admin/obama.html"&gt;3/24/2009 news conference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Now, have — am I completely satisfied   with all the work that needs to be done on deficits? No. That’s why I   convened a fiscal responsibility summit, started in this room, to start   looking at entitlements and to start looking at the big drivers of costs   over the long term. Not all of those are reflected in our budget, partly   because the savings we anticipate &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt; be coming in years outside of   the 10-year budget cycle that we’re talking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these uses of &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;seem to deal with hypothetical situations — or sometimes with actual situations that are being treated as if they were hypothetical, often as part of a process of matching answers to alternative questions, or solutions to alternative problems (&amp;quot;For someone who wants X, Y would be the best choice&amp;quot;).. Thus it seems plausible to count them all as instances of &amp;quot;modal remoteness&amp;quot;, even if they don&amp;#39;t count literally as instances of either Huddleston&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;remote conditional&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tentativeness&amp;quot; categories. In the survey below, I&amp;#39;ll call these &amp;quot;implicit remote conditionals&amp;quot;, though it might be preferable instead to include remote conditionals in a broader &amp;quot;irrealis&amp;quot; category of reference to hypothetical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get a crude sense of the relative frequency of these different uses of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; in recent American English, I used a random sample of 50 of the 891,081 instances of this word in the 385M words of the &lt;a href="http://www.americancorpus.org/"&gt;COCA corpus&lt;/a&gt;, respresenting various sorts of American English texts dating from 1990-2008. The results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CGEL Category&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;br&gt;
(of 50)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 &lt;/strong&gt;(past time &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;volition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;propensity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 &lt;/strong&gt;(backshifted &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;future &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;in past time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan="3" align="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; (modal remoteness)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tentativeness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;explicit remote conditional&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;implicit remote conditional&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample had no examples of what I've called the TWBM construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of backshifted &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; from my sample of 50 instances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The government hoped at the time that this unusual step would both calm markets and lead to a recovery.&lt;br&gt;
Mrs. Doncaster said Dad would take them in, but he wasn't back yet.&lt;br&gt;
Air resistance was yanking her down, and in moments she would be tumbled to pieces on the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of explicit remote conditionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;They're the ones who aided and abetted his bookishness. He would've been a normal kid if not for them.&lt;br&gt;
And the second one would be, if you don&amp;#39;t, would this enable science, maybe, not to use testing on animals anymore …&lt;br&gt;
In fact, we would almost certainly be healthier if we did imitate Hollywood …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of implicit remote conditionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most families would be disappointed to have a gay son.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People who would otherwise think torture is wrong justify it because the world is evil.&lt;br&gt;
Such a transition would mark the creation of social boundaries in  addition to the symbolic boundaries marked by literacy and the pursuit  of connections to the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the take-away message here is that cases of &amp;quot;modal remoteness&amp;quot; make up about half the total, and that discussions of hypothetical situations without any explicit if-clause — what I&amp;#39;ve called &amp;quot;implicit remote conditionals&amp;quot; — are about 3/4 of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot checks of other sources show the use of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; similarly dominated by hypotheticals, just as Rodney Huddleston noted in the quote at the start of this post. Thus according to the transcript of President Obama's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/us/politics/24text-obama.html"&gt;3/24/2009 news conference&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; was used 19 times, and 13 of the them were "implicit remote conditionals" like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And so this provision would affect about 1 percent of the American  people. They would still get deductions. It’s just that they wouldn’t  be able to write off 39 percent. In that sense, what it would do is it  would equalize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 13, I haven't counted this one, which I counted as an instance of the TWBM construction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Isn’t that kind of debt exactly what you were talking about when you said passing on our problems to the next generation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A:&lt;/strong&gt; First of all, I suspect that some of those Republican critics have a short memory, because as I recall, I’m inheriting a $1.3 trillion deficit, annual deficit, from them. That &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt; be point number one. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps this should have been the 14th "implicit remote conditional": "If I were responding to those Republican critics, that would be point number one".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests one plausible source for the TWBM construction, the one that  I had in mind when I&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245#comment-26445"&gt; suggested&lt;/a&gt; that it's used to present an "evaluative reaction to a hypothetical situation". At least, I think that this is half of the story. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238755096674"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2253">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77572df78ed6df0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="mimicry"/><category term="photo"/><title type="html">Insect leaf mimics</title><published>2009-04-03T10:37:32Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T10:37:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/insect-leaf-mimics/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another busy day, so how about some more pretty photos? &lt;img title="mimic" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/mimic.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=213" alt="mimic" width="300" height="213"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No surprises here, she continues to bang on about the link between autism and vaccination, despite there being no scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But science is not something that seems to bother Jenny, ex-Playboy model, bit-actress and now best selling author (*shudder*). You see, she possess what she terms a “Mommy instinct” and this means she knows all, even more than all the doctors and scientists of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me about this holier than though “Mommy” was her repeated dropping of the “F” bomb throughout the interview. Not very “Mommy”-like in my opinion. One would have thought it appropriate to be on your best behaviour should the respectable Time Magazine come knocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wash your mouth out with soap young lady. Mind you, I thought Time let her get away with some pretty crazy claims without challenging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people who blame autism on vaccines point to the mercury in the shots, yet mercury has been removed from most vaccines and autism rates continue to climb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t believe it’s only the mercury. Aluminum and other toxins also play a role. The viruses in the vaccines themselves can be causing it, too&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire interview &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists and defenders of reason have been debunking Jenny’s misinformed nonsense for some time now. The latest installment being the “&lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt;” website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.toysrus.com/"&gt;Toys 'R' Us&lt;/a&gt; has a list of &lt;a href="http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=3088669"&gt;10 toys that speak to autism&lt;/a&gt;. The list is &lt;a href="http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=3088669"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and includes a train set, K'nex, a special set of Crayola markers with permanently attached paint brushes, stacking and nesting blocks, a camera with what I'm presuming is a very tough plastic outercase (in the event of being dropped/tossed/etc.). The camera in particular would have been interesting to have had when Charlie was younger; he had variations of all the rest, though not with some of the clever doodads (the Crayola paintbrushes "won't dry out," the "My First Story Reader Sesame Beginnings" books have buttons and carry handles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it's helpful to have some suggestions about toys when stepping into the mega big-box atmosphere of a Toys 'R' Us store. In the interest of "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/having_awareness_of_awareness"&gt;autism awareness&lt;/a&gt;," I'm wondering what Toys 'R' Us could also do to make in its stores less, well, stressful. Because stressful is the best way to describe what it was like for Charlie to be in a Toys 'R' Us store, which is over-stimulating to the max, what with the overly tall aisles crammed with the latest from Hasbro, Fisher-Price, and Hot Wheels and (in some stores) ferris wheels and the like. We have always bid a hasty retreat for the Exit after buying some item we weren't sure Charlie, or any of us, thought anyone wanted---just wanted to get out of there. When he was 5, Charlie pretty much insisted on making a beeline for the video/DVD section and those proved the only things he was ever interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't been inside a Toys 'R' Us since Charlie was 7 or so. Target might have fewer selections, but still enough to choose from, and I started finding most things for Charlie online. Most of the Toys 'R' Us toy selections are fairly "busy" in appearance, with lots of colors and patterns and little drawings. Charlie's always been drawn to toys that are in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3203512803/"&gt;solid colors and without too many extraneous parts&lt;/a&gt;: We like to keep it simple. One of his most favorite toys when he was younger was a barn set, with little plastic animals, a wagon, three plastic bales of hay, one farmer, two water troughs, four pieces of fence (I remember all this because I was constantly taking inventory and tracking down missing pieces to store in the two-story, four-roomed barn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd suggest that Toys 'R' Us, if it's serious about being "autism-friendly," rethink the big box design and offer ways to sensitive toy-shopping to the sensory-challenged. Something has to be done about the glare of the fluorescent lights and the sheer overwhelmingness of being surrounded by "so much." Sure, I know you can just choose (as we did) not to go into a Toys 'R' Us. But toy-purchasing being one of those things one finds oneself doing if one has a child (of whatever diagnosis), perhaps there's a way to make the whole experience less.......stressful. And, actually, fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238740653625"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5132279060671944483">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4882f98458c455bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Perhaps I&amp;#39;m Losing it; I Don&amp;#39;t Know.</title><published>2009-04-04T03:36:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T03:47:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/MFxaOobmO_A/perhaps-im-losing-it-i-dont-know.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5132279060671944483/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5132279060671944483" title="17 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/perhaps-im-losing-it-i-dont-know.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">I am fucking tired of being shot at from both sides of the fence for five years because I actually want to reach the opposing side.

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I stumbled upon disturbing information regarding my alma mater, the Harvard Medical School (HMS). Its professed commitment to investigate implausible medical claims had somehow metamorphosed into the advocacy of such claims. I’ve previously mentioned some of this on SBM (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=115"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=415"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). A couple of pertinent essays appeared in the public domain in &lt;a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/05/cambridge-02138.html"&gt;2002 &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.reason.com/news/printer/28808.html"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, but the full story was much more involved than those pieces revealed. In the wake of recent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=433"&gt;posts &lt;/a&gt;on SBM about medical schools exposing students to uncritical portrayals of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=395"&gt;pseudomedicine&lt;/a&gt;, it seems appropriate to tell more of it. I’ve also decided to name names, which is something that I would have been reticent to do a few years ago. The basis for that decision will become clear over the next few posts, I trust. This topic will require at least three posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;My discovery that HMS had begun promoting pseudoscientific medical claims was occasioned by my experience on the Massachusetts &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031027133035/http://www.state.ma.us/reg/current/2002medp/"&gt;Special Commission&lt;/a&gt; on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners, which met from the fall of 2001 to the winter of 2003. Another member of that commission was David Eisenberg, the Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education (CAMRE) and of the new Osher Center for Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies. Dr. Eisenberg is best known for his &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/4/246"&gt;1993 article&lt;/a&gt; reporting the use of ‘unconventional therapies’ by Americans. He had been appointed to the commission by the MA Commissioner of Public Health at the time, Dr. Howard Koh–whom President Obama has &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/26/a_harvard_dean_gets_call_from_washington/"&gt;recently nominated&lt;/a&gt; to be Assistant Secretary of HHS. I assumed then, and still do, that Dr. Koh presumed Dr. Eisenberg to be an objective expert on “CAM,” since that was the persona presented by HMS and by Dr. Eisenberg himself. I had my doubts, but before then I’d not bothered to look into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;It was during commission meetings, when I had the opportunity to hear what Dr. Eisenberg and his surrogate had to say or not to say and when I examined some of their writings and funding sources, that I began to realize how far his project was deviating from what I imagined to be the agenda of HMS. Some of what I saw amounted to frank dishonesty: failure to disclose obvious conflicts of interest to the Commission, for example. I also discovered public promotions of dubious “CAM” practices and practitioners by the CAMRE, in spite of its formal purpose being that of investigating “CAM” practices in an attempt to find out if any might be useful. I was concerned enough to look at other “CAM” information offered in the name of Harvard, and I found more worrisome examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;I also attended the Feb., 2001 Harvard Complementary and Integrative Medicine Course, directed by Dr. Eisenberg (&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020204024246/http:/cme.med.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/hmscme.cgi?SECTION=CLASSES&amp;amp;ID=00222597&amp;amp;SO=N"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;is a link to the similar 2002 course brochure). A few of the talks were reasonable, if banal. I did my best to give them the benefit of the doubt, because I still could not accept that HMS would seriously consider homeopathy, ‘life-force,’ and ’subluxations’ as being worthy of study, much less advocacy. After attending a semi-rigorous talk on raw herbs as medicines (the presenter discussed some studies but not the looming question of why whole herbs might be preferable to purified molecules), I ran into Eisenberg and did my best to be polite and encouraging. I shouldn’t have, because most of the content of the course was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=11"&gt;misleading and pseudoscientific&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, its tone was more like a political rally or a religious revival than a scientific conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;At that course I ran into Russell Phillips, who had been in my group of interns at the Beth Israel Hospital (Boston) in 1979. I’d seen him around from time to time over the years, and I’d known that he’d stayed on at the BI after his residency. I was surprised, however, to learn that he was now the Director of the Harvard CAMRE Fellowship program. I was even more surprised to learn, during a short conversation with him, that he was innocent of the chiropractic ’subluxation theory’ and that he’d never heard of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://quackwatch.org/"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It seemed to me that there was either a surprising naivete among this crowd or an attempt by some to shun unpleasant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;I discussed these issues with &lt;a href="http://www.healthcoalition.ca/relmanbio.pdf"&gt;Arnold Relman&lt;/a&gt;, the only other skeptical physician on the Commission. Dr. Relman was the emeritus Editor-in-Chief of the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and Professor Emeritus at HMS. He agreed with me in every detail, even offering a terse explanation for why HMS would tolerate such folly: “The five-dollar word is ‘pusillanimous’.” Naively, I hoped that Dr. Relman would use his clout to lead a vanguard of reason back to HMS, and that the matter would be short-lived (I based this expectation on Relman’s recent &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html"&gt;demolition&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, of Andrew Weil’s writings, which suggested to me that he would warm to a fight closer to home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Dr. Relman, however, wanted little part of any formal complaint to HMS, stating that he had “&lt;a href="http://www.healthyskepticism.org/library/ref.php?id=11675"&gt;other fish&lt;/a&gt; to fry” and warning that battling quackery was a bottomless pit that would consume me if I insisted on pursuing it. He also must have known something I didn’t yet know: that the “CAM” epidemic had already made zombies out of some at the highest levels of the HMS administration. Nevertheless, Dr. Relman eventually supported me in some very important ways, for which I’m grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;I decided to approach &lt;a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/office/federman.html"&gt;Dan Federman&lt;/a&gt;, then the Senior Dean for Alumni Relations and Clinical Teaching and the highest ranking member of the HMS administration whom I still knew from my medical school days in the ’70s. Dr. Federman, an endocrinologist, had been a role model for me and for many other students: he was a paragon of kindness, knowledge, rational thinking, and ability to communicate. It seemed to me that he couldn’t possibly be duped by the “CAM” machinations going on right under his nose, if only he knew about them. He had been quoted, when HMS &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000902155946/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/news/releases/0700compmed.html"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;the creation of the CAMRE in the summer of 2000, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;The primary function of the new division is to coordinate research and evaluation of alternative and complementary remedies and approaches at Harvard Medical School,” says Daniel Federman, M.D., HMS Senior Dean for Alumni Relations and Clinical Teaching. “When research using standard methods of assessment has demonstrated effectiveness, there should be no need for the term complementary; and when it does not, support for such claims should be withdrawn. This is a large research agenda that will occupy much effort. At the same time, we will be teaching our students how to understand and evaluate complementary modalities and thus help their patients in a comprehensive therapeutic effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;I first discussed the issue with Dr. Federman in the fall and winter of 2001-02, not long after philanthropist Bernard Osher had granted $10 million to the HMS CAMRE, including an endowed chair for Dr. Eisenberg. Harvard &lt;a href="http://focus.hms.harvard.edu/2001/Apr20_2001/bulletin.html"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;the grant in language similar to what Dr. Federman had said in the previous year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division rigorously evaluates complementary and integrative medical therapies to distinguish useful from useless treatments and to foster a rational, evidence-based introduction of complementary and integrative medical care into mainstream medical education and practice. The division concentrates on assessing the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and mechanisms of action of these treatments. Appropriate educational activities and policies pertaining to the clinical delivery of complementary medical therapies are being developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;In retrospect, I should have recognized the last sentence of that announcement as a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Dr. Federman and I had 2-3 meetings and a few e-mail exchanges over a couple of months. He seemed appropriately concerned. He agreed that it would not do for the CAMRE to promote ‘CAM’ rather than merely perform ‘research and evaluation.’ He asked me to present him with written documentation of my charges, and promised that if it agreed with what I’d told him he would appoint an &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; faculty committee to investigate. I was mostly optimistic, although Dr. Federman made a comment that I found worrisome: he referred to Dr. Relman as a “zealot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;In the late spring I sent Dr. Federman the documentation that he had requested, in the form of a draft of an article that I had hoped would be accepted by &lt;em&gt;Harvard Magazine.&lt;/em&gt; The draft was a response to a misleading, promotional &lt;a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/03/the-new-ancient-trend-in.html"&gt;piece &lt;/a&gt;about Eisenberg and the CAMRE in the March-April issue (&lt;em&gt;Harvard Magazine&lt;/em&gt; declined my offer, but published a &lt;a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/05/cambridge-02138.html"&gt;letter &lt;/a&gt;instead). I’ve made minor language changes and added hyperlinks to sites that existed at the time, to the extent that they are still available. Here is part of it; the rest will follow next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;………………..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Comments on Harvard Medical School’s “Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Readers of Craig Lambert’s “&lt;a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/03/the-new-ancient-trend-in.html"&gt;The New Ancient Trend in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;(Harvard Magazine Mar/Apr 2002) can’t be faulted for concluding that the mission of HMS’s foray into “alternative medicine” is “the application of skeptical science to…unconventional treatments.” Even that goal is of dubious value and based on false premises, as will be discussed in subsequent parts of this article. The evidence shows, however, that a major additional goal of the project is the public promotion, ranging from implicit to explicit, of practices that are both absurd and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following advice offered on the “information resources for consumers” &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020222174952/http:/www.bidmc.harvard.edu/medicine/camr/Patients.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; of the Caregroup/Harvard Medical School Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education (CAMRE):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 1in 0pt 0.5in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please consult your local telephone yellow pages under these categories:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Acupuncture&lt;br&gt;
Chiropractic&lt;br&gt;
Holistic Practitioners&lt;br&gt;
Massage - Therapeutic&lt;br&gt;
Naturopathic Physicians&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;In order to appreciate the implications of this appeal, it is necessary to examine the beliefs and practices of at least one of the recommended groups. “Naturopathic physicians” are a recent manifestation of the field known as “naturopathy,” whose origins were in the 19th century German “natural living” movement. Early naturopaths railed against contemporary medical advances such as the Germ Theory and vaccinations, but espoused the “water cure,” fasting, herbs, homeopathy, colonic “detoxification,” and other fanciful methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;The content of the field has changed little since then, but the trappings have become distinctly modern. A subset of naturopaths now claims to practice “a distinct form of primary health care,” according to the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020614092953/http:/www.naturopathic.org/about/definitions.htm"&gt;official definition&lt;/a&gt; on the website of their national organization, the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020607194455/http:/naturopathic.org/about_aanp.htm"&gt;American Association of Naturopathic Physicians&lt;/a&gt; (AANP). They &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010123221500/http:/www.ncnm.edu/modalities.html"&gt;state &lt;/a&gt;that they are “primary care physicians, most of whom are in general private practice [and] trained to be the doctor first seen by the patient for general healthcare, for advice on keeping healthy, and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;“Naturopathic doctors” or “N.D.’s,” as they also call themselves, state that they have received training appropriate to the practice of medicine, including a basic science curriculum equivalent to that taught in medical schools. This training occurs in one of four schools in the U.S., each of which offers a four-year, on campus curriculum, but no significant hospital or residency experience. Three of the schools are unaffiliated with larger universities; the fourth, the &lt;a href="http://www.bridgeport.edu/naturopathy/index.html"&gt;University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in Connecticut, is owned by the Unification Church, known more commonly as the “Moonies.” The schools have little interaction with the scientific community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Naturopaths believe in “vitalism,” the long discredited notion that biological processes don’t conform to universal physical and chemical principles. They claim to “treat the cause of a problem, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress the symptoms.” They claim to know how to “boost the immune system” with herbs and homeopathic preparations. They claim to have esoteric knowledge about preventive medicine that is, implicitly, unknown to “conventionally” trained physicians, public health experts, nurses, nutritionists, and others. They claim special expertise in nutrition and in the use of “natural remedies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;What is the reality of these claims? Naturopaths invoke a few simplistic “theories” to explain the causes of all disease. These include the actions of ubiquitous, but ill-defined “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox.html"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;”; widespread “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/allergytests.html"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt;”; dietary sugar, fat, and gluten; inadequate vitamins and minerals (which naturopaths offer for sale); epidemic &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html"&gt;candidiasis&lt;/a&gt; (yeast infections); &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirosub.html"&gt;vertebral “misalignments”&lt;/a&gt; (a canard borrowed from chiropractic); and a few others. To “diagnose” these entities naturopaths use an assortment of absurd methods, among which are “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html"&gt;iridology&lt;/a&gt;” or iris diagnosis, which claims that the entire body is represented on the iris of the eye; “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/ak.html"&gt;applied kinesiology&lt;/a&gt;” by which, for example, an “allergy” to a particle of food is detected by placing the food particle in one hand of a patient and observing a resulting weakness in the other; &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html"&gt;hair analysis&lt;/a&gt;; “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/electro.html"&gt;electrodiagnosis&lt;/a&gt;,” which measures the skin’s resistance to a tiny electric current; “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/livecell.html"&gt;live cell analysis&lt;/a&gt;”; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Naturopathic “therapies” are an eclectic assortment of implausible and unproven methods, among which are “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/gastro.html"&gt;colonic irrigation&lt;/a&gt;” (enemas) and fasting for “detoxification,” hydrotherapy (wrapping part or all of the body in wet towels), homeopathy, &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; and “oriental medicine,” chiropractic manipulation, aromatherapy, arduous dietary schemes, intravenous vitamin C and hydrogen peroxide, whole enzyme pills, and other dubious “natural remedies” including botanical, animal, and mineral products, several of which are known to be dangerous. Naturopaths sell “remedies” to their clients &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020219113703/http:/aanp.net/MotherNatureFAQ.html"&gt;at a considerable profit&lt;/a&gt;, an obvious conflict of interest that is &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020617000030/http:/www.naturopathic.org/about/medication_sales.htm"&gt;formally approved&lt;/a&gt; by their national organization, the AANP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;How does all this translate into the practice of “naturopathic medicine?” Mainstream naturopathic literature shows numerous examples of practices and recommendations that are both absurd and dangerous. Among these are the repudiation of standard treatments of &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020616233424/http:/www.naturopathic.org/about/strep_throat.htm"&gt;strep pharyngitis&lt;/a&gt;, acute otitis media,[1] and other potentially catastrophic childhood infectious diseases, while offering instead such ineffective “alternatives” as homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and “natural antibiotics” (e.g., herbs such as Goldenseal); affiliation with the strident &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/immu.html"&gt;anti-vaccination&lt;/a&gt; movement; the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010219051416/http:/www.healthy.net/aanp/Library/articles.lay/EK.Asthma1.html"&gt;repudiation of standard treatments of asthma&lt;/a&gt;, offering instead, for example, a hydrogen peroxide bath to “bring extra oxygen to the entire surface of the skin, thus making the lungs somewhat less oxygen hungry” or “gems and minerals…worn as jewelry, or placed around the home in special places”; warnings against proven medical and surgical treatments for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis, while instead recommending unproven herbs and EDTA chelation “therapy”;[2]treatment of the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010429081215/http:/www.aanp.net/Library/articles.lay/EK.stroke.html"&gt;acute stroke&lt;/a&gt; patient with damp compresses and aromatherapy; claims that NDs can diagnose chronic, debilitating diseases such as &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030518030621/http:/www.scnm.edu/news/uploads/ms.pdf"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; at a much earlier stage than can “conventional” physicians, and effect a cure by fanciful methods; claims that &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020206135626/healthybreastprogram.on.ca/workbook.htm"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; can be prevented and cured by an assortment of unproven, expensive “supplements” and “tests” that are not appreciated by “conventional” doctors, nurses, and public health experts; ubiquitous “toxin” hysteria, including anti-fluoridation statements, warnings against most proven pharmaceuticals, and claims that “25% of Americans suffer from heavy metal toxicity”;[3] claims that they can offer “&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010123221500/http:/www.ncnm.edu/modalities.html"&gt;natural childbirth&lt;/a&gt;” at home without complications; the exuberant promotion and sale of “dietary supplements” for all complaints, with little regard for safety; and much more. Naturopaths have not subjected these claims to rational study, because they are already convinced that they work. In summary, “naturopathic medicine” is best understood as a pseudoscientific cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;A 1999 survey of the small number of N.D.s in Massachusetts, performed by two investigators from Children’s Hospital, is consistent with these findings. They found that only 20% of those surveyed would recommend that parents have their children vaccinated, and that only 40% would refer a two-week old infant with a temperature of 101° F (a dire, life-threatening emergency) for definitive medical care.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that the authors of the Harvard CAMRE website are naïve about the recommendations they have made? Not likely. In 1997 David Eisenberg, the Director of the Harvard CAMRE and of the new Osher Center for Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies, cited the 1st edition of the Textbook of Natural Medicine,[5] the only general textbook of “naturopathic medicine,” in an article entitled “&lt;a href="http://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/01jul97/seekaltr.htm"&gt;Advising Patients who Seek Alternative Therapies&lt;/a&gt;.” The textbook includes most of the claims documented above, but Dr. Eisenberg failed to discuss any of them. Instead of warning of the obvious dangers awaiting patients who seek “alternative therapies” from naturopaths, he blandly stated: “Naturopathy is licensed in 12 states and the District of Columbia. The AANP provides contacts for local licensing and regulatory boards and general information on naturopathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010807005815/http:/www.bidmc.harvard.edu/medicine/camr/address.html"&gt;address to the American Board of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, also in 1997, Dr. Eisenberg appeared to call for the nationwide licensure of naturopaths and other “CAM” practitioners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Necessary Tools to Improve the Status Quo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 1in 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 1in 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A national listing of licensed alternative medical providers (e.g., chiropractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists, naturopaths, and homeopaths) in each of the 50 states as well as a uniform credentialing process.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;If his intent had been to rein in dangerous practitioners through strict governmental regulation, this suggestion might have made some sense. It was not, as is clear from the following history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"&gt;Beginning in the fall of 2000 and lasting for more than a year, Dr. Eisenberg was the official representative of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to the Commonwealth’s “Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners.” In spite of its name, the main purpose of the Special Commission was to consider the request of “naturopathic physicians” to become licensed health care providers in Massachusetts. Two legislators friendly to the naturopathic licensing effort had urged the formation of the Commission, and both were among its members. The total membership was twelve, of whom only three were physicians. The other two physicians were Arnold Relman, representing the Board of Registration in Medicine (later represented by the BRM Chairman, Peter Madras), and I, representing the Massachusetts Medical Society. Of the remaining members, none was a scientist. The Commission was to study the naturopaths’ request and make a recommendation to the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sort of licensure that these naturopaths were seeking would imply a tacit promise, by the Commonwealth to its citizenry, that “NDs” are legitimate health care providers whose methods have proven validity. It would give them a broad license to diagnose and treat illnesses and to call themselves “doctors” and “physicians.” They would answer to a board controlled by their own colleagues, and thus determine their own standard of care. They would be positioned in the political arena to demand third party reimbursement, as has already happened in the state of Washington. Naturopaths are now licensed in 11 states, with varying degrees of latitude for practice and self-regulation, but in all of these they are free to make broad claims of medical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eisenberg came to only about half the meetings and largely refrained from discussing naturopathic practices. Usually he sent a surrogate, attorney Michael H. Cohen, “Director of Legal Programs, Division for Research and Education in Complementary &amp;amp; Integrative Medical Therapies, Harvard Medical School.” Mr. Cohen’s &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020609114152/http:/www.michaelhcohen.com/articles.html"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt; show that he is an unabashed champion of efforts by CAM practitioners to achieve legitimacy not through science, but through legal pressure. His distaste for, and misunderstanding of modern medicine is clear in this passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[B]iomedicine by and large perpetuates a delusional sense that a human being is only material–a three-dimensional substance locked in the physical body, amenable to mechanical interventions that are tightly controlled by a series of carefully circumscribed rules. Biomedicine encourages over-identification with the body: it is fear-based; disease induces desperation in the “race for the cure” rather than focus on “care of the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020705100527/www.michaelhcohen.com/article4.html"&gt;same essay&lt;/a&gt; he likens “biomedicine” to “sleep,” which “cannot bring us one iota closer to true reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, then, is the path to true reality in health care? Health and healing can involve the highest of which a human being is capable. Near-death experiences, encounters with angels, and events that touch the individual’s interior castle and border on mysticism-these experiences manifest ‘light,’ in the sense of coming closer to that which is Supreme at the edges of our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the purest sense, therapies from hypnosis to meditation aim to free the dis-eased seeker, and the culture as a whole, from the matrix of mechanism, reductionism, and other ills, to a realm where the human spirit finds rest. As Vasistha says: “Subdue the mind with the mind. Purify the mind by the mind. Destroy the mind by the mind.” When the mind is purified, the real can be grasped. Complementary and alternative therapies offer this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the essay Mr. Cohen argues that prohibitions against health fraud are counterproductive, as are disciplinary actions by medical boards against practitioners who “[deviate] from conventionally agreed norms,” i.e., standards of care. In considering what the appropriate role of future health laws might be, he muses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would legal structures be able to handle the notion that healing involves mind, body, emotions, and spirit, but also such other dimensions of the human experience as inter-species communication and greater sense of earth-consciousness (Gaia)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cohen and Dr. Eisenberg helped to write the Special Commission’s &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/majority.pdf"&gt;pro-naturopathic licensure report&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends a broad license for naturopaths to diagnose and treat illnesses and to form a self-regulating board of “Naturopathic Medicine.” With a few minor exceptions, it is exactly what the naturopaths had requested. The report lacks any significant discussion of naturopathic claims &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, but clings to the superficial trappings of legitimacy such as the existence of schools, exams, accreditation, and so forth. As both Dr. Eisenberg and Mr. Cohen know, the standard of care for a self-regulating health profession is determined by that profession.[6] Thus if the naturopathic board were to be realized it would inevitably promote, as its standards of care, &lt;em&gt;substandard&lt;/em&gt; medical practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pro-licensure report was signed in Jan. 2002 by six commissioners, including an Assistant Commissioner of Public Health who attended the final meeting in Dr. Eisenberg’s stead. An &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/minority.pdf"&gt;opposition report&lt;/a&gt;, which cited multiple examples of dangerous naturopathic claims, was signed by three, including the two remaining physician commissioners. Three commissioners abstained.The implications of Dr. Eisenberg’s delegation of Atty. Cohen, and of his own lack of engagement in the debate at this commission, are not to be underestimated. Most of the non-expert commissioners deferred to him for guidance, but he was notably silent when the other two physicians characterized naturopathic claims as baseless and dangerous. In private, both Dr. Eisenberg and Mr. Cohen told me that I had called attention to the “excesses” of the field (of which Dr. Eisenberg said he had not previously been aware), implying that such practices don’t reflect those of the great majority of naturopathic “physicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This erroneous view was somehow promulgated to others on the commission, because it was eventually invoked by the Senate Chairman of the Committee on Health Care, one of the abstaining commission members, in a letter to the rest. These practices are standard for “naturopathic physicians,” however, as evidenced by their sources: the &lt;em&gt;Textbook of Natural Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which Dr. Eisenberg had cited in one of his own papers, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Naturopathic Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the Position Papers and other articles offered on the website of the AANP, which Dr. Eisenberg had also cited in the same paper, articles on the websites of the four naturopathic schools, and other &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/misrep.html"&gt;published opinions &lt;/a&gt;of the “leaders” of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Dr. Eisenberg several times to meet outside of the din of commission meetings to discuss the issue at some length, but he declined. I subsequently wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Public Health suggesting that Dr. Eisenberg may have a conflict of interest regarding naturopaths. Dr. Eisenberg responded angrily, but did not offer any evidence to refute this charge. Below, it is shown to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Dr. Eisenberg had stressed to the commission that it must consider the irrational &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of “naturopathic medicine,” the outcome might have been different. An example of the level of critical thinking that existed among the non-scientific members was this: In justifying his premature decision to end the debate, the Chairman, who is also the chairman of the Massachusetts Division of Professional Licensure, referred to arguments over scientific validity as merely a “battle of the bands,” with each side having no more claim to truth than the other. This crude postmodern relativism was not challenged by Dr. Eisenberg, who must know that dissolved oxygen can’t be absorbed through the skin in quantities sufficient to revive a suffocating asthmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it sound as though the public health interests of the Commonwealth were well represented at this commission? Did its emissaries do Harvard Medical School proud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unfortunate affair is consistent with other facts of HMS’s involvement with “CAM.” Dr. Eisenberg accepts funding for his annual Harvard CAM conference from one of the aforementioned naturopathy schools, the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM) in Tempe, Arizona. The school’s own list of donors is top-heavy with “dietary supplements” companies, beginning with GAIA Herbs, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school’s Chief Medical Officer is Thomas Kruzel, ND. Kruzel &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030518030621/http:/www.scnm.edu/news/uploads/ms.pdf"&gt;claims &lt;/a&gt;that multiple sclerosis is caused by diets high in fat and sugar, and that naturopaths can diagnose the disease, using “tongue” and “pulse diagnosis,” at a much earlier stage than can “conventional” physicians. This, he writes, allows naturopaths to effect cures (not possible with “conventional” medicine) through a combination of homeopathy, wet compresses (to “increase oxygenation in the blood”), acupuncture, herbs, and a diet based on the patient’s blood type. Kruzel’s claims of medical expertise are broad: for &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020112085332/http://www.aanp.net/Library/articles.lay/ProstateCancerTK.html"&gt;cancer of the prostate &lt;/a&gt;he recommends “electrical current in the form of positive galvanism, applied transrectally.”&lt;/p&gt;

I am excited and already started reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking o Varmus, he seems to be everywhere. See &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5983036.ece" title=""&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in TimesOnline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A major investment in fighting tropical infections and chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes in poor countries would transform international perceptions of the US, according to Harold Varmus, who co-chairs the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.

&lt;p&gt;In an exclusive interview with The Times, Dr Varmus said that American diplomacy had undervalued the role of medicine and science in fostering friendly relations with developing nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is asking President Obama to endorse a plan from the US Institute of Medicine that would almost double annual US support for global health to $15 billion by 2012. ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/harold_varmus_is_everywhere_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/UM2b5B-dYhU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238737553549"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/the_best_of_march.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28f60aaa352fec17</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Housekeeping"/><title type="html">The Best of March</title><published>2009-04-03T03:14:31Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T03:14:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/QAawI2lD8LU/the_best_of_march.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/the_best_of_march.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted 239 posts in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/" title=""&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a productive and pleasant &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/back_from_boston.php" title=""&gt;trip to Boston&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_second_season_of_the_beaco.php" title=""&gt;'Beacons of the Bloggerati'&lt;/a&gt; came back yet another year.

&lt;p&gt;And I could not resist taking some more stabs at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_falsest_balance_in_journal.php" title=""&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/memo_to_self-described_sane_ra.php" title=""&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm starting to detect some buzz on this very important front, which I wrote about in detail in 2005's The Republican War on Science and elsewhere. Basically, the story is this: In 1995 the Gingrich Republicans, looking to slash budgets-and looking askance at science in general in many areas-got rid of their scientific advisory office, which had been in existence since 1972 and had become world renowned not only for accurate studies, but for far-ranging analyses that forecast future science and technology problems that we might someday have to grapple with. For our unfailingly presentist elected representatives, this was a vital source of perspective on where things are heading.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many people don't know that pneumonia kills more children than malaria, measles and AIDS combined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's been remarkable to watch how malaria has become, over the last five years, a "cool" disease. After decades in which it received little funding or attention (that's partly our fault in the media), malaria is now a major cause, with funding pouring into everything from bednets to vaccines to research into genetic tinkering with mosquitoes so that they can't infect people with malaria. The upshot is going to be huge numbers of lives saved.

&lt;p&gt;One of those active in the malaria campaign is Lance Laifer, and he's now plotting a new effort to take on pneumonia. Respiratory tract infections are a huge problem in the developing world and kill vast numbers of kids, and so some attention could make a huge difference. More power to him and others trying to focus on pneumonia...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The woods are full of misunderstandings about OA.  They thrive in almost every habitat, and the population soars whenever a major institution adopts an OA policy.  Contact between new developments and new observers who haven't followed the annual migrations always results in a colorful boomlet of young misunderstandings. 

&lt;p&gt;Some of these misunderstandings are mistaken for one another, especially in the flurry of activity, because of their similar markings and habitat.  Some are mistaken for understanding by novices unfamiliar with the medley of variant plumage, adaptive camouflage, and deceptive vocalizations.  This field guide should help you identify 25 of the most common visitors to your neck of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave your binoculars at home.  All of these can be seen with the naked eye.  With no more than this guide, and some patient observation, every trip to a conference, and even an occasional faculty meeting, can be an enjoyable and educational outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

W.'s term for it: &lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;Quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;. One tool advocates of "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) use to try to "get 'em while they're young," so to speak, is to promote themselves among student groups. I've complained about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/summer_school_for_woo.php"&gt;American Medical Student Association (AMSA)&lt;/a&gt; before, but AMSA is not the only culprit. Beware the student-run interest group in "cross-cultural and integrative medicine," especially when it hooks up with a CAM institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Kreider, whose experience is a little closer to home than I really like, tells the tale of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=391"&gt;homeopath&lt;/a&gt; named Dr. Larry Baskind and a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=395"&gt;naturopath&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href="http://www.innersourcehealth.com/peter.html"&gt;Peter Bongiorno&lt;/a&gt; giving talks on campus, truly painful for physicians who want to teach medical students science- and evidence-based medicine, rather than woo. Unfortunately, having been in contact with Tim, I know there's more to come, and it may not be pretty. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, check out why Tim is one of the best new medical student bloggers out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/homeopaths_and_naturopaths_and_cam_oh_my.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dazZdYdWd7I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238736595493"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2765">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0fa39428cf45d8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="James Randi Educational Foundation"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><category term="Pigasus Awards"/><title type="html">JREF’s Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced</title><published>2009-04-03T05:29:21Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T05:29:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/jrefs-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, the James Randi Educational Foundation gives out awards for those who spread the most amount of pseudo-scientific woo over the past year.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Maryland woman involved with a group described as a religious cult pleaded guilty in the starvation death of her son, but insisted that the charges be dropped when he is resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m all for that clause. In fact, I’ll go as far as to say that if that happens, then not only should the charges be dropped, but this woman should be worshipped as a fucking god if that happens. I look forward to the long wait to see if this kid resurrects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She certainly recognizes that her omissions caused the death of her son,” Silverman said. “To this day, she believes it was God’s will and he will be resurrected and this will all take care of itself. She realizes if she’s wrong, then everyone has to take responsibility … and if she’s wrong, then she’s a failure as a mother and the worst thing imaginable has happened. I don’t think that, mentally, she’s ready to accept that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you but I’m thinking it’s probably the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

But her fame is growing in less elevated circles: she's an outspoken promoter of the anti-vaccination movement. Her claims that vaccines cause (or contribute to) autism &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/why-you-should-listen-to-celebrities/"&gt;are nothing short of breathtakingly ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;But the bar has been set even higher now: a new website has been created called &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt;.

The website, created by skeptic Derek Bartholomaus, stops short of saying she is directly responsible for these illnesses and deaths, but her &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; responsibility is arguably relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238732407989"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/buyer-beware-the-brassage-the-naked-truth-about-healthy-underwear-abc-news/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e640b525b8b54a72</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="pseudoscience"/><category term="ABC News"/><category term="Brassage"/><category term="Breast Cancer"/><category term="detox"/><category term="toxins"/><title type="html">Buyer Beware the Brassage?

Click the link and watch the video as ABC News tears these frauds a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so typical of pseudo-scientific charlatans. They lead potential customers to believe their product has medical benefits and that medical experts were behind making the product but they keep the benefits as vague as possible to avoid a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when you express even the slightest bit of skepticism about their claims, they dishonestly try to deflect it by playing the victim card. A classic example is this recent interview with $cientologist spokesman Tommy Davis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But way to go ABC for sticking to your guns and nailing these assholes with their sham medical product and especially for pointing out that chiropractors ARE NOT REALLY DOCTORS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC, please, please, please do more stories like this where you get interviews with actual doctors challenging the claims and really scrutinize their claims.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the crack cocaine of the internet; once you start it’s hard to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the folks in charge of it have decided to use that addictive quality to their advantage. This week is &lt;a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/"&gt;the IYA’s 100 Hours of Astronomy effort&lt;/a&gt;, where observatories and other ventures are doing all sorts of outreach including live observations, all spanning the 100 hours of time from April 2 - 5. And &lt;a href="http://www.galaxyzooblog.org/2009/04/01/1-million-classifications-in-100-hours/"&gt;Galaxy Zoo wants to classify 1,000,000 galaxies in those 100 hours&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound crazy? &lt;strong&gt;They’re already halfway there!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;[Incidentally, in the time it took me to write this blog entry 9000 more have been classified.]&lt;/em&gt; If you’ve fiddled with Galaxy Zoo before, you know how much fun it is: all you have to do is take a simple test so that they know you can classify galaxies (into elliptical, irregular, and spiral (both clockwise and anticlockwise)) and once you do, off you go. They’ve made some improvements to the process since I last wrote about it, so even if you’ve been there before, it’s time to revisit. It’s fascinating, it’s fun, and you’re using real data and doing a real contribution to science. &lt;/p&gt;

in medical laboratories. I've been meaning to write something about that for a while; now
seems like a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'm not someone who thinks that being cruel to animals is no big deal. I have known
some people like that, but thankfully they're &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rare, and none of them
were scientists whose work involves doing animal testing in real laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But animal testing isn't about pointless cruelty. It's about understanding things that we
simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; learn about in any other way. It's extremely important to minimize the
cruelty we inflict on the subjects of animal tests: there's no benefit in torturing an animal;
there's no good reason to inflict unnecessary pain on any living thing. When we
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; study something without using animals, we should. When we must use animals
in scientific study, we should be as kind to them as we possibly can. But the fact remains that in many cases, animal studies are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I don't want to get into a long discussion of the ethics of it here; that's a discussion
which has been had hundreds of times in plenty of other places, and there's really no sense
repeating it yet again. But there is one thing I can contribute to this discussion. One of the
constant refrains of animal-rights protesters arguing against animal testing is: "Animal
testing isn't necessary. We can use computer simulations instead." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As a computer scientist who's spent some time studying simulation, I feel qualified 
to comment on that aspect of this argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The simplest answer to that is the old programmers mantra: "Garbage in, Garbage out".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/04/can_simulations_replace_animal.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/04/can_simulations_replace_animal.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/A13mj53oHrs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238717950507"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/do_you_think_obama_will_pay_at.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/397cd60736611529</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Do you think Obama will pay attention to a poll?</title><published>2009-04-03T01:03:07Z</published><updated>2009-04-03T01:03:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/cKskE84hosg/do_you_think_obama_will_pay_at.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/do_you_think_obama_will_pay_at.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;He apparently has a new and stupid habit, and US News and World Report wants to know what we think of it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people have trouble sleeping--such as, in extreme cases, shift workers--those problems are not always rooted in disturbances in circadian rhythm, argues the University of Pennsylvania's ALLAN PACK. Instead, his studies of sleep have shown that the master clock is only one player in the molecular control of sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;New findings support a controversial hypothesis about the biological role of sleep: Snoozing may be a way for the brain to clear clutter accumulated after a hard day of synapse forming and strengthening. Two Science studies published today suggest that the brains of sleeping Drosophila undergo an overall depression in synaptic strength and number, eliminating some minor neuronal connections while merely weakening stronger ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gene expression studies are lending support to a new, somewhat counterintuitive hypothesis for why every animal sleeps. KELLY RAE CHI visits the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where scientists are gathering evidence suggesting that we need sleep to prune back synapses, which tend to increase in strength throughout the day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sleep takes up around a third of our lives, and is an object of fascination during the other two thirds. "I dreamt that..." is surely among the top 10 conversation topics of all time. Given this, it is surprising how little attention is paid to the anthropology of sleep. Intriguing (but too little) work has been done on sleep practices in nonindustrialized societies, 1 and there has been some engaging speculation about sleep patterns; 2 it all points to our Western conventions as being a behavioral outlier. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most recently, our fearless leader had been hit by a car and then robbed (thankfully, not in the same day, but still…suck-o-rama!). Other things have been kicking the Skepchicks in the ass, so needless to say, we could use some cheering up. That’s where this month’s contest comes in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODE TO SKEPCHICK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contest Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of venoms is a wonderful example of an evolutionary process. We're all familiar with the idea of venomous snakes, but the cool thing is that when we examine exactly what it is they're injecting into their prey, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2005/11/21/which-came-first-the-snake-or-the-venom/"&gt;it's a collection of proteins that show a nested hierarchy of descent&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient reptiles had a small and nasty set of poisons they would use, and to improve their efficacy, more and more have been added to the cocktail; so some lizards produce venomous proteins, while the really dangerous members of the Serpentes produce those same proteins, plus a large array of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/lizard_venoms.jpg" width="400" height="502" alt="lizard_venoms.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So something like CRISP (Cystein RIch Secretory Protein) is common to all, but only the most refined predators add PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Phosopholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lethally poisonous snakes are nice and cute and all, but we all know where the interesting action really is: cephalopods. Let's leave the vertebrates altogether and look at a venomous protostome clade to see what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/ceph_venom_glands.gif" width="442" height="503" alt="cephalopod venom glands"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11px"&gt;Relative glandular arrangements of a cuttlefish and b octopus. Posterior gland is shown in green; anterior, in blue. Orange structure is the beak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Fry, who did all that excellent work characterizing and cataloging the 
pharmacy of venoms secreted by poisonous snakes, has also turned his hand to the cephalopods. He examined the products of the venom glands of octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, and found a range of proteins, some unique, and others familiar: CAP (a CRISP protein), chitinase, peptidase S1, PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and others. There are a couple of interesting lessons in that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, evolution doesn&amp;#39;t just invent something brand new on the spot to fill a function — what we find instead is that existing proteins are repurposed to do a job. This is how evolution generally operates, taking what already exists and tinkering and reshaping it to better fulfill a useful function. Phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance, is a perfectly harmless and extremely useful non-venomous protein in many organisms — we non-toxic humans also make it. We use it as a regulatory signal to control the inflammation response to infection and injury — in moderation, it&amp;#39;s a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; thing. What venomous animals can do, though, is inject us with an overdose of this regulator to send our local repair and recovery systems berserk, producing swelling that can incapacitate a tissue. Similarly, a peptidase is a useful enzyme for breaking down proteins in the digestive system…but a poisonous snake or cephalopod biting your hand can squirt it into the tissues, and now it&amp;#39;s being used to digest your muscles and connective tissue. Some effective venoms are simply common proteins used inappropriately (from the perspective of the target).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting observation is that cephalopods and vertebrates have independently converged in using some of the same venoms. In part, this is a consequence of historical availability — all animals have phospholipases,, since they are important general signalling molecules, so it&amp;#39;s part of the collection of widgets in the metazoan toolbox from which evolution can draw. It&amp;#39;s also part of an inflammation pathway that can be exploited by predators, in the same way that we have shared proteins used in the operation of the nervous system that can be targeted by neurotoxins. So there is independent convergence on a specific &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; of these proteins as toxins, but one of the things that facilitates the convergence is a shared ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, some very diverse groups seem to consistently settle on the same likely suspects in their venoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/venom_table.gif" width="449" height="471" alt="Venom table"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But finally, there must also be physical and chemical proteins of these particular proteins that must also predispose them to use as toxins. After all, animals aren&amp;#39;t coopting just any protein for venoms — they aren&amp;#39;t injecting large quantities of tubulin or heat shock proteins into their prey. There must be something about each of the standard suspects in venoms that make them particularly dangerous. What the comparative evolutionary approach allows us to do is identify the common molecular properties that make for a good venom. As Fry explains it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically the proteins chosen are from 
widely dispersed multigene secretory protein families with 
extensive cysteine cross-linking. These proteins are collectively much more numerous than globular enzymes, 
transmembrane proteins, or intracellular protein. Although 
the relative abundance of these protein types in animal 
venoms may reflect stochastic recruitment processes, there 
has not been a single reported case of a signal peptide 
added onto a transmembrane or intracellular protein or a 
hybrid protein expressed in a venom gland. A strong bias is
also evident for all of the protein-scaffold types, whether 
from peptides or enzymes. Although the protein scaffolds 
present in venoms represent functionally and structurally 
versatile kinds, they share an underlying biochemistry that 
would produce toxic effects when delivered as an "overdose". Toxic effects include taking 
advantage of a universally present substrate to cause 
physical damage or causing changes in physiological 
chemistry though agonistic or antagonistic targeting. This allows the new venom gland protein to have an 
immediate effect based on overexpression of the original 
bioactivity. Furthermore, the features of widely dispersed 
body proteins, particularly the presence of a molecular 
scaffold amenable to functional diversification, are features 
that make a protein suitable for accelerated gene duplication and diversification in the venom gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify, killing something with a secreted poison typically involves reusing an extant protein, but not just any protein — only a subset of the proteins in an animal&amp;#39;s proteome has just the right properties to make for a good venom.

Who among us, for whom autism is a big and daily part of our lives, has not styled themselves an expert or at least an authority on autism, at some point or other?  Even though it's agreed that no one knows the exact cause or autism, or if there are (as there may well be) multiple causes of autism, or how best to teach a child on the spectrum, many a person seems ready and willing to explain all about autism, and all the more so during autism awareness month. And, too, today is &lt;a href="http://www.worldautismawarenessday.org/site/c.egLMI2ODKpF/b.3917065/k.BE58/Home.htm"&gt;World Autism Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and time again in the past decade since my son was diagnosed with autism, I've thought I knew "this is just so" about autism, about autism in my son, and been proven wrong. This has been most egregiously true in regard to sensory issues: I still remember the conviction with which I told an evaluator from the St. Paul Public School District that Charlie had "no sensory issues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in the past few years, Charlie's sensory sensitivities can't have been more on display. Sounds---loud, high-pitched, sudden, clang of metal-on-tile---send his hands over his ears. His longtime preference for all things polarfleece is just one indication of tactile sensitivity. When he was younger, he very carefully sniffed each morsel of food before eating it, and sometimes socks, and shoes.  Strong tastes----soy sauce, horshradish---and bland ones---good old white rice---are his favorites. Indeed, "something sensory" often plays at least a minor role in many of Charlie's doings and when he gets upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good then to read about (yes, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_doesnt_cause_autism_another_new_study"&gt;yet another&lt;/a&gt;) new theory of autism that looks at the brain and highlights an area that processes sensory signals from the body. As reported in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news157813985.html"&gt;PhysOrg&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at &lt;a href="http://www.aecom.yu.edu/home/default.asp"&gt;Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University&lt;/a&gt; are proposing that autism is a developmental disorder caused by "impaired regulation of the locus coeruleus, a bundle of neurons in the brain stem that processes sensory signals from all areas of the body":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus has widespread connections to brain regions that process sensory information. It secretes most of the brain's noradrenaline, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in arousal mechanisms, such as the "fight or flight" response. It is also involved in a variety of complex behaviors, such as attentional focusing (the ability to concentrate attention on environmental cues relevant to the task in hand, or to switch attention from one task to another). Poor attentional focusing is a defining characteristic of autism.&lt;br&gt;
.......&lt;br&gt;
"What is unique about the locus coeruleus is that it activates almost all higher-order brain centers that are involved in complex cognitive tasks," says Dr. [Mark F.] Mehler, [M.D., chairman of neurology and director of the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at Einstein].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drs. [Dominick P.] Purpura [, M.D. dean emeritus and distinguished professor of neuroscience at Einstein] and Mehler hypothesize that in autism, the LC-NA system is dysregulated by the interplay of environment, genetic, and epigenetic factors (chemical substances both within as well as outside the genome that regulate the expression of genes). They believe that stress plays a central role in dysregulation of the LC-NA system, especially in the latter stages of prenatal development when the fetal brain is particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 study in &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; that found a connection between the onset of fever and behavioral changes in 30 children (aged 2-18 years) on the spectrum is mentioned a providing gist for the scientists' new theory. The limitations of the 2007 study, including the number of children in it and fact that the behavioral changes noted were not directly observed by the authors of the study, but &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/fever/comment-page-1/#comment-12831"&gt;recalled by parents in a survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the singling out of the locus coeruleus, and especially its secretion of neurotransmitters that evoke the "fight or flight" response as well as its connection with attention switching and focusing, stand out. There's often a lag for Charlie to switch his focus from one thing said to him to the next, to one object he's looking at to the next. Conversely, "fight or flight" response can arise in Charlie all of a sudden; it's perhaps as if he's ever on the brink of launching into self-protection, if not self-preservation, mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's always something new to learn about autism----perhaps, in this month of "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/having_awareness_of_awareness"&gt;autism awareness&lt;/a&gt;," we'd do well to ask ourselves what don't we know, and how can we feel in the gaps in our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238706389772"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-2456544886275514638">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa3ae9dc2a973351</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="life" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Life - Or something like it</title><published>2009-04-02T20:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T21:05:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/04/life-or-something-like-it.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/2456544886275514638/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=2456544886275514638&amp;isPopup=true" title="4 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Bah. Almost 4 months since I've posted anything here. Certainly a new record.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I pointed out &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/11/what-else-has-been-going-on.html"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;, my life has largely taken me away from the topics about which this blog is ostensibly centered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as things often go, life is beginning to take me back to topics on which I feel are worthwhile to blog about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've mentioned my attendance at conventions several times in the past, and this past month saw yet another con come and go. This one was Naka Kon 2009 and was my first con I've attended as a staff member (game room overlord if anyone cares). Aside from that duty, I also managed to get myself roped into MCing the cosplay competition (Note to self: Next year, wear gel insoles in costume's shoes).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But perhaps most pertinent was the panel I prepared. It's something I'd been working on for nearly 5 months and went over astoundingly well. The title was "Science of Anime". The idea was to take various phenomenon I'd noticed in anime that were certainly not realistically possible, and use science to show just &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; nonsensical they really were. The title was patterned off the series of TV shows with titles like "Science of Star Wars" or the "Science of Batman" which occasionally pop up on the Discovery channel. In reflection, I really wish I hadn't named it such (and I'll probably change it in the future) because those shows try to rationalize obviously fictional events with scientific principles but stretch them so implausibly all over, that it's right back into the realm of science fiction. The shows are cute, but ultimately I'm not a fan of them. Thus, I think my future title will be "Anime Mythbusters - Where everything's BUSTED".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the panel was videotaped, but since it was in a dark room with a powerpoint, the room is too dark to see me, and the screen is to bright and is overexposed. So the video is worthless. I'm working on getting the audio ripped and making a video with just the slides, but it'll take awhile longer since the person doing my editing work's computer doesn't like the codecs I used to export some of the videos. I'll make a post when it's up on Youtube (or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/youtube_has_banned_the_james_r.php"&gt;perhaps somewhere else&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is also working to take me towards a new career. For the past 9 months, I've been working as a waiter to pay the bills until my lease is up and I can look for a real job somewhere else, but now I'm planning on moving back to St Louis and am planning to teach high school physics (and astronomy if the school offers a course in that area). As such, physics and astronomy education have been on my mind quite a bit recently and I have ideas for a few posts on that topic that I'll likely be writing up when I find time. I've already done an interview with one school district and have resumes out to a few more. Hopefully things will go well.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-2456544886275514638?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238701429009"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=7067">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91693172def44bd5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="bicycling"/><category term="transportation"/><title type="html">Are Bicyclists Free Riders?</title><published>2009-04-02T20:46:38Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T20:46:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/25iFvjE_QIg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/are-bicyclists-free-riders/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| Do bicyclists contribute their fair share to the transportation network?

The subject was birth control, in particular &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/why_the_wingnuts_hate_plan_b.php"&gt;Plan B&lt;/a&gt; and other forms of emergency contraception, and as many of you know, the Bushite regime dragged its feet with ridiculous deliberation in allowing the FDA to approve these forms of contraception, and effectively blocked them from public access. By hook and crook, by cheating and deception, and by lying to the people, as this court decision affirms. &lt;a href="http://writ.lp.findlaw.com/hamilton/20090402.html"&gt;This is why we fight the inclusion of religion in government: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;it poisons everything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decision is remarkable in its detailed accounting of the corruption that religious viewpoints can wreak upon public policy. That the right-to-life community was able to derail the availability of emergency contraception so easily is a testament to how bad things truly were in the Bush Administration. It should be unnecessary to say this, but I will: Science, health, and healing should be the focus of the FDA. The pattern of conduct the district court decision reveals is lawless, not only with respect to FDA procedures, but also with respect to the constitutional right to obtain contraception established by the Supreme Court Griswold v. Connecticut. This is not the state's role. Indeed, the imposition by the Bush FDA of the religious beliefs of some upon others who do not believe is antithetical to our system. The core of the Establishment Clause is intended to prevent this sort of substitution of religious reasoning for sound public policy decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that era is over, right? Don't start cheering yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Bush seems not to have been able to make public decisions without reference to right-wing religious beliefs. That inclination was probably reinforced by his practice of having a weekly conference call with conservative Christian clergy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is troubling to learn that President Obama appears to have instituted the same practice of scheduled weekly consultation with clergy. While Presidents from the start have looked to their faith to give them courage and solace, and many have had a religious counselor for one-on-one discussions, the weekly call with a committee of clergy is quite different. It would be very hard to believe that the discussion does not veer away from spiritual counseling, and into public policy. And what other political interest groups get this kind of access to the President? Reading Judge Korman's well-reasoned and well-supported decision in Tummino, one is reminded that one cannot assume that religious advising is always, or even usually, politically-neutral. Moreover, it is never accountable to the people, by constitutional design. The President, however, is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't forget that these so-called "spiritual leaders" use the credibility conferred by these weekly meetings to reinforce their political authority and push a political agenda on their flocks. It's a tool that is abused and gives political leverage to people who are often the enemies of secularism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know who Obama's consulting clergy are? These are people to be watched; I'd also like to see that we urge Obama to also listen to dissenting voices. Where's the weekly consultation with atheists, I might ask? Or with scientists and engineers? Why is he wasting time with those pious con artists, anyway?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_creeping_fungus_of_religio.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/F-8cozuM4RU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238700644052"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/you_people_are_obsessed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68e2d51abff8d7dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">You people are obsessed</title><published>2009-04-02T19:32:53Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T19:32:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Nm7QDuOvy-U/you_people_are_obsessed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/you_people_are_obsessed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another blog entry tops the 1K mark: I'm closing the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/god_abortionist.php"&gt;God, abortionist&lt;/a&gt; thread and opening this one up for any spillover.

Blake writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I’d like to express the great honour I feel at being&lt;br&gt;
offered the chance to ask a question of this august community.  Of&lt;br&gt;
course, it’s an honour I had coming to me, being as I am a well-known&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://elitistbastardscarnival.blogspot.com/"&gt;Elitist Bastard&lt;/a&gt; known for dashing good looks and raging intellectual&lt;br&gt;
prowess as much as I am known for my modesty (that is to say, not at&lt;br&gt;
all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the television network formerly known as the Sci Fi Channel&lt;br&gt;
announced its intention to change its name to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/03/sci_fi_channel_reframes_self_w.php"&gt;SyFy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
which appears to be a Polish word meaning roughly “zit-semen”.  The&lt;br&gt;
change was hailed (by the people who thought it up) as a positive move&lt;br&gt;
in the network’s plans to become more “with it”.  Channel president&lt;br&gt;
Dave Howe was quoted as saying, “It made us feel much cooler, much&lt;br&gt;
more cutting-edge, much more hip, which was kind of bang-on what we&lt;br&gt;
wanted to achieve communication-wise.”  Howe then went on to act like&lt;br&gt;
Your Friend’s Dad, putting on a sweater vest and asking, “What music&lt;br&gt;
is this?  It’s got a neat beat!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SyFy wants to move beyond the “typical sci-fi themes of space, aliens&lt;br&gt;
and the future”, into territory explored by written SF for, I dunno,&lt;br&gt;
more than half a century.  As part of this plan, the channel will&lt;br&gt;
launch a new series, &lt;em&gt;Warehouse 13,&lt;/em&gt; featuring a secret&lt;br&gt;
government facility which stores relics from. . . uh. . . space aliens&lt;br&gt;
and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, management is being a bunch of useless rutting&lt;br&gt;
loonies.  And it’s up to us to save them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:  You’ve got an hour of TV time to fill every week,&lt;br&gt;

His subject was the then new documentary movie, “A Beautiful Truth.“ “Truth” is about the Gerson method - the dietary deprivation cum coffee enema cancer treatment developed by Dr. Max Gerson, a refugeee from Germany I the 1930s. His daughter, Charlotte now runs the Gerson Institute in Tijuana, Mexico. Gerson is one of the models for the Gonzales method recently reviewed by Kim Atwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously referred to the movie in a prior post (1) (but in a different context. Here I’ll explore the movie from a different angle - with its partners, propaganda documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David called my attention to “Truth” plus another by the same producer - with trailers on You Tube. When I watched the trailers last year I saw myself interviewed briefly, but could not recall being filmed, or even identify where the scene took place. I had to email Steve Barrett, also in the movie, who reminded me about filmmaker Steve Kroschel’s visits 2-3 years before, although neither did he have strong memory of the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slowly began to recall. Kroschel had called for an interview saying he had previously made a movie about Gerson but felt he should make more objective one, presenting “both sides.“ He pitched himself as having been misled in making the first one. He spoke and asked as though he was being critical of Gerson. After he left I did not think about it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before critiquing such documentaries, some words about the Gerson method. According to the American Cancer Society’s “Unproven Methods” pamphlet, the Gerson regimen, includes eating large amounts of fruits and vegetables, limiting fat and meat; consuming only fresh, raw juices prepared in a special way, eliminating salt, and “detoxifying” the liver through coffee enemas, and taking injected liver extracts. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saul Green also wrote a definitive description of coffee enemas and the Gerson method (Green S. A critique of the rationale for cancer treatment with coffee enemas and diet.(3) &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;. 1992;268:3224-3227.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other components of the Gerson regimen, include consuming only fresh, raw juices prepared in a special way, eliminating salt. and “detoxifying” the liver through coffee enemas and injected liver extracts. Years earlier, Eisele reported in JAMA deaths from potassium deficiency induced by frequent coffee enemas. (4) Other complications include colon perforation and ulceration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sad and poignant small book about Gerson’s method is “Death be Not Proud” by former (and late) writer, John Gunther. His young son had a brain tumor and was sent to Gerson where for his last months on earth he submitted to the dietary torture that is Gerson‘s method. It’s a trying read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for efficacy, G. Hildenbrand, the Gerson publicist for years, his son, and a statistician reported prolonged survival of a group of melanoma patients treated by Gerson as a “nested” group - of their patients, in this case, a group selected from within a larger group, retrospective and without concurrent control.(5) Other reports of success have been single testimonials, or studies invalidated by large dropout rates, lack of controls, and other deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I viewed the “Truth” trailer I concluded the film was a push piece advertisement for Gerson, and as my memory re-formed, I concluded I had been had. The film had been edited - a lot. I had said more things than shown, and probably so had Steve and Dean. Edell (who also had been interviewed and had not recalled Kroschel when I emailed him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroschel did not mention to me he was also interviewing Barrett and Edell. Want to ask why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is that we have been shown an edited propaganda film made by a probable contract advertiser, likely financed by the Gerson Clinic itself or a support organization, who presented false or incomplete credentials and misrepresented his approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even more important: We do not know the whole stories of any of the patients. The patient testimonials were filmed and the records “shown” to the camera, but were not shown to us, the critical docs. Why were our opinions not requested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroschel made no reference to any specific case to me, although he already knew of cases, used in the prior film or a prior one. The trailers present the sequences of us first and then the interviews, making it seem that the cases are evidence in opposition to our statements. The order should have been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the film does not mention what if any, other standard treatments the patients had received. So I reviewed the trailer again for statements of other treatments or denial of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroschel selects two cases “at random.” I do not believe that. If the clinic had so many successes, they could have written them up and presented the report to a scientific forum or journal like the rest of us do. They have not done so. Those were probably setup - selected cases. Selected from a group of 100? Out of thousands of people who have gone there, dating to before WW II?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Gerson Clinic is not a primary care institution - people go there for a few weeks at most, return home and records there are not complete. They often do not know what other treatments the people get. Now for the two patients shown .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first woman with melanoma. The diagnosis was apparently confirmed by biopsy. Good. But melanoma is one of the 4-5 most common tumors that regress “spontaneously“. This single episode is credible, but cannot be used as a proof of Gerson effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, a man with testis cancer, referred to receiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is 90 percent effective in producing complete remissions, and about 80 percent of those are considered cures. As for the doc’s surprise, I also usually showed surprise and enthusiasm when a person had a good response. People often considered their responses as “miraculous” or a least special - an assumption I did not discourage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third, the Japanese professor, relates an ultrasound as the evidence for the colon cancer metastases. In absence of a biopsy proof, we do not know what the ultrasound finding really was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I cannot believe that all three had the respective cancers and had complete responses to the diet and coffee enemas. I do not know what evidence was withheld. And why was a third film made or recreated out of material made for the second one? Were the cases collected since the “Beautiful Truth” film was made? Why not call us back to review the cases? Kroschel considers himself the arbiter of what constitutes review, evidence, and the validity of his own inexpert conclusions. Kroschel’s principles for validity- replication, confirmation, and publication - some sort of journalistic scale of things. Replication was apparently the presence of three cases; confirmation was apparently done by interviewing the patients, and publication - the making of a promotional film. The viewers are supposed to accept that as proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promotional documentaries misrepresenting pseudo-scientific subjects and quacks have become a neat route to public opinion molding. David Gorski in his post took on “Expelled”, with Ben Stein, the pop economist turned education expert who promotes the concept of equal time for Intelligent Design with Evolution in the public education science classroom. Makes me wonder if in fairness, the ID people would allow biology teachers to show one of the excellent films on evolution after every sermon in fundamentalist churches. Stein’s motive seems to be intellectual freedom in education, but in expressing it, how come he has to render Evolution a smack aside the head? Well, that seems to go along with quack claims doesn’t it? Demeaning of what we know to be valid is a convenient and apparently powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988 a main attraction was “Hoxsey: Quacks Who Cure Cancer?“ It is a classic promotional piece for a quack. Hoxsey’s history and battles with the FDA and the AMA’s Morris Fishbein spanned three decades, as Hoxsey’s fortunes went from clinics in 27 states to his ignominious end in a storefront clinic in Tijuana and his own death from cancer. But not before he had won a defamation suit against Dr. Fishbein and was awarded $1 for his trouble and reputation. Incidentally, Hoxsey’s cure was a mix of herbs and common backyard weeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quacks” was not just a retro on an interesting pseudosci - folk hero episode in American history. The film concentrated on the presumed greed and power of the medical-pharmaceutical industry, and the evils of the FDA, all presented as a conspiracy against the public. Reviewers (Vincent Canby) from the NY Times (http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;amp;res=940DE5DD153BF930A35751C0A96E948260) to the SF Chronicle were moved enough by the movie to accept its content as accurate, and to give favorable reviews. “Quacks” was a political propaganda piece with a heavy ideological agenda, evident to us, but which took in the unknowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quacks‘s” release was hyped over national news networks (I have a tape of the NPR segment) and was timed to coincide with the launching of the Office of Technoogy Assessment’s investigation of “Unorthodox Cancer Treatments” ordered by Congressman Molinari (D, New Jersey,) whose chief of staff was also an employee of the Lawrence Burton “Immuno-augmentive therapy” in the Bahamas - where Burton set up shop after being successfully prosecuted in New York. This clinic was found to be infusing plasma contaminated with HBV and HIV. Molinari’s abuse of office in ordering an investigation of off-beat quack cancer claims was the precedent for Senator Harkin’s (D, Iowa) equally offensive surge into “CAM“ resulting in the NCCAM and our present history in the making. The film was also the center for a rally on the steps of the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no collection would be complete without a mention of “Sicko!” by film propagandist Michael Moore. Lots of people got taken in by his driveling and drooling hailing to the chief medical system of Castro’s Cuba. Sicko won Moore a special Oscar and an award at Cannes. Sicko was exposed as an edited, biased promotion for a revolution in the medical and health system in the US, and yet another out-of-court indictment and conviction of the evils of physicians and the US medical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw “Quacks”, and still have a tape of it. I have not seen “Sicko“ or “Truth” or its one or two predecessors, nor, like David, do I plan to cross Kroschel’s palms with as much as two cents for it. So I can be criticized for critiquing films I have not seen, right? OK, but I’m satisfied that I’ve seen enough of “Truth” to suspect it contains nothing that would warm my heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let's say that Jenny's in bed with a cold and asks her partner Anne to take out a book for her from the library. This Anne does, but on the way home she loses the book. Maybe she absentmindedly puts it on a shelf in the grocery store and it gets stolen, or she forgets to close her backpack and the book falls into an open manhole along the way. Who pays the library for the lost book?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers know I am no fan of Jenny McCarthy. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/why-you-should-listen-to-celebrities/"&gt;I have called her a public health risk here before&lt;/a&gt;, and I stand by that: her claim that vaccines cause (or contribute to) autism is nothing short of breathtakingly ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m not the only one who knows this to be true. Medical doctors &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/random_deserved_swipes_at_jenny_mccarthy.php"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=308"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt; have words about her, as does &lt;a href="http://skepticdad.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/jenny-mccarthy-vs-time-magazine/"&gt;Skeptic Dad&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Stop Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; site was created to expose her as the danger she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the gauntlet is well and truly thrown down: a website has been created called &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt;. Stark and grim, it has one purpose: to show how many preventable illnesses and preventable deaths have occurred due to unvaccinated people since Jenny McCarthy became the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; face of the antivaccination movement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website, created by skeptic Derek Bartholomaus, stops short of saying she is directly responsible for these illnesses and deaths, but her &lt;em&gt;indirect&lt;/em&gt; responsibility is arguably relevant. We know that some outbreaks of measles have occurred due to the antivax movement, for example. And there have been deaths — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/24/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-from-a-preventable-disease/"&gt;children have &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — because they were unvaccinated. McCarthy may have started out as a comedian, but I’m not laughing at her anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/mccarthybodycount.jpg" alt="Jenny McCarthy Body Count"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistics for the site are from &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/"&gt;the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality reports&lt;/a&gt;, which Bartholomaus has linked for reference. The diseases specifically include measles, mumps, rubella, polio, tetanus, Hib, the flu, and diphtheria. In fact, his numbers underestimate the problem, since other vaccine-preventable diseases are not listed in the CDC reports. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of fatalities are from the pediatric flu, a tragedy I have a difficult time grasping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenny McCarthy Body Count site itself only launched on March 29, but it’s already had thousands of views. Bartholomaus, a self-described &amp;quot;statistics geek&amp;quot;, updates it by hand once a week, when the new CDC reports are issued. He also has some basic info on McCarthy’s claims there, but for more background info on McCarthy and her pro-disease stance, go to &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt;Stop Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too bad we need something like this site, but McCarthy gets a free pass from the media, even from those &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/01/a-few-shots-at-vaccines"&gt;that claim to &amp;quot;spar&amp;quot; with her&lt;/a&gt; (but really only give her a platform in which she can spew more dangerous nonsense). The Jenny McCarthy Body Count site is a very stark — and sadly, very necessary — reminder that just because people’s beliefs aren’t real, they can still have a very real and very tragic impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238693545500"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=7037">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/486db6a236c2a0f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="recession"/><title type="html">"The World Does Go On, It Just Looks Terrible"</title><published>2009-04-02T17:05:48Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T17:05:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/tW0flAVdu_4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/the-world-does-go-on-it-just-looks-terrible/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| Blackstone CEO Stephen A.

&lt;p&gt;The history of venoms is a wonderful example of an evolutionary process. We're all familiar with the idea of venomous snakes, but the cool thing is that when we examine exactly what it is they're injecting into their prey, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2005/11/21/which-came-first-the-snake-or-the-venom/"&gt;it's a collection of proteins that show a nested hierarchy of descent&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient reptiles had a small and nasty set of poisons they would use, and to improve their efficacy, more and more have been added to the cocktail; so some lizards produce venomous proteins, while the really dangerous members of the Serpentes produce those same proteins, plus a large array of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/lizard_venoms.jpg" width="400" height="502" alt="lizard_venoms.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So something like CRISP (Cystein RIch Secretory Protein) is common to all, but only the most refined predators add PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Phosopholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lethally poisonous snakes are nice and cute and all, but we all know where the interesting action really is: cephalopods. Let's leave the vertebrates altogether and look at a venomous protostome clade to see what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/ceph_venom_glands.gif" width="442" height="503" alt="cephalopod venom glands"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relative glandular arrangements of a cuttlefish and b octopus. Posterior gland is shown in green; anterior, in blue. Orange structure is the beak.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Fry, who did all that excellent work characterizing and cataloging the 
pharmacy of venoms secreted by poisonous snakes, has also turned his hand to the cephalopods. He examined the products of the venom glands of octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, and found a range of proteins, some unique, and others familiar: CAP (a CRISP protein), chitinase, peptidase S1, PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and others. There are a couple of interesting lessons in that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, evolution doesn&amp;#39;t just invent something brand new on the spot to fill a function — what we find instead is that existing proteins are repurposed to do a job. This is how evolution generally operates, taking what already exists and tinkering and reshaping it to better fulfill a useful function. Phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance, is a perfectly harmless and extremely useful non-venomous protein in many organisms — we non-toxic humans also make it. We use it as a regulatory signal to control the inflammation response to infection and injury — in moderation, it&amp;#39;s a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; thing. What venomous animals can do, though, is inject us with an overdose of this regulator to send our local repair and recovery systems berserk, producing swelling that can incapacitate a tissue. Similarly, a peptidase is a useful enzyme for breaking down proteins in the digestive system…but a poisonous snake or cephalopod biting your hand can squirt it into the tissues, and now it&amp;#39;s being used to digest your muscles and connective tissue. Some effective venoms are simply common proteins used inappropriately (from the perspective of the target).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting observation is that cephalopods and vertebrates have independently converged in using some of the same venoms. In part, this is a consequence of historical availability — all animals have phospholipases,, since they are important general signalling molecules, so it&amp;#39;s part of the collection of widgets in the metazoan toolbox from which evolution can draw. It&amp;#39;s also part of an inflammation pathway that can be exploited by predators, in the same way that we have shared proteins used in the operation of the nervous system that can be targeted by neurotoxins. So there is independent convergence on a specific &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; of these proteins as toxins, but one of the things that facilitates the convergence is a shared ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, some very diverse groups seem to consistently settle on the same likely suspects in their venoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/venom_table.gif" width="449" height="471" alt="Venom table"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But finally, there must also be physical and chemical proteins of these particular proteins that must also predispose them to use as toxins. After all, animals aren&amp;#39;t coopting just any protein for venoms — they aren&amp;#39;t injecting large quantities of tubulin or heat shock proteins into their prey. There must be something about each of the standard suspects in venoms that make them particularly dangerous. What the comparative evolutionary approach allows us to do is identify the common molecular properties that make for a good venom. As Fry explains it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically the proteins chosen are from 
widely dispersed multigene secretory protein families with 
extensive cysteine cross-linking. These proteins are collectively much more numerous than globular enzymes, 
transmembrane proteins, or intracellular protein. Although 
the relative abundance of these protein types in animal 
venoms may reflect stochastic recruitment processes, there 
has not been a single reported case of a signal peptide 
added onto a transmembrane or intracellular protein or a 
hybrid protein expressed in a venom gland. A strong bias is
also evident for all of the protein-scaffold types, whether 
from peptides or enzymes. Although the protein scaffolds 
present in venoms represent functionally and structurally 
versatile kinds, they share an underlying biochemistry that 
would produce toxic effects when delivered as an "overdose". Toxic effects include taking 
advantage of a universally present substrate to cause 
physical damage or causing changes in physiological 
chemistry though agonistic or antagonistic targeting. This allows the new venom gland protein to have an 
immediate effect based on overexpression of the original 
bioactivity. Furthermore, the features of widely dispersed 
body proteins, particularly the presence of a molecular 
scaffold amenable to functional diversification, are features 
that make a protein suitable for accelerated gene duplication and diversification in the venom gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify, killing something with a secreted poison typically involves reusing an extant protein, but not just any protein — only a subset of the proteins in an animal&amp;#39;s proteome has just the right properties to make for a good venom. Therefore, we see the same small set of proteins get independently coopted into the venom glands of various creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poster child is a surefire tug at our hearts.  The children picked to represent charity fund-raising drives are brave, determined, and inspirational, the most innocent victims of the cruelest whims of life and health...no other symbol is more beloved by Americans than the cute and courageous poster child--or more loathed by people with disabilites themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure pity may sell, but does that justify its use?  Does that justify ignoring the wishes those who are being targeted by the pity who clearly, repeatedly, state that pity undermines their human rights?  Does selling raffle tickets or walk miles make pity something we should, if not support, at least ignore?  And also, good grief, haven't we learned anything from history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan Kemp Jr., &lt;a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/ada/kemp.html"&gt;Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; under George Bush, Sr. and EEOC commissioner under Reagan, said of pity use by the MDS telethons in the early 1990's (source, Shapiro),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By arousing the public's fear of the handicap itself, the telethon makes viewers more afraid of handicapped people...playing to pity may raise money, but it also raises walls of fear between the public and us."  Further, by focusing on innocent children, the telethon, he said, "seems to proclaim that the only socially acceptable status for disabled people is their early childhood.  The handicapped child is appealing and huggable--the adolescent or mature adult is a cripple to be avoided."  Kemp objected that the telethon focused on the tragedy of a small number of children who died from muscular dystrophy, when in reality a far greater number of adults, like himself, lead normal lives with neuromuscular conditions.  Finally, he charged, "the telethon's critical stress on the need to find cures supports that damaging and common prejudice that handicapped people are 'sick.'  As sick people, it follows that we should allow others to take care of all our needs until a cure is found."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Shapiro's commentary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear, disabled people understand, is the strongest feeling they elicit from nondisabled people.  Fear underlies the compassion for the poster child and the celebration of the supercrip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As "world autism awareness day" and "autism awareness month" bombard us with fundraising requests and panicked images of "innocent children" or the "bravery of those who overcome autism," remember that the path to eliminating these destructive stereotypes has been walked before.  Major charities such as &lt;a href="http://www.easterseals.com/site/PageServer"&gt;Easter Seals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ucp.org/"&gt;United Cerebral Palsy&lt;/a&gt; have listened to their constituents, and changed their fundraising tactics to remove the pity messages--without hurting their fundraising.  Pity is not required to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kemp's observations aren't specific to MD.  They're not even specific to just physical disabilities.  Kemp's observations are relevant to all disabilities.  If we want a better world for disabled (including autistic) individuals, pity and fear have got to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For organizations that insist on perpetuating fear and pity messages despite the contrary views of the people they claim to serve, an important question to ask might be, what constituency are these organizations really serving?  The disabled individuals as they claim, or someone or something else?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238689518638"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=7289">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0259cf1208b2c560</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="eric morris"/><category term="traffic"/><title type="html">Crossroad Blues</title><published>2009-04-02T16:51:35Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T16:51:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/043_oo88hyo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/cross-road-blues/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Do you think the trials of your evening commute deserve national recognition?

Weather lovely, wish you were here.  Athens more beautiful than I had expected.  And for me, a grammarian married to a philosopher and interested in logic and mathematics, being in Greece is utterly awe-inspiring. The Greeks invented alphabets (writing systems that separate the consonants from the vowels) and the Western tradition of grammars (which basically start with Dionysius Thrax; yes, Panini in India was much earlier, but that is not where today's grammatical tradition comes from, because no one in Europe knew about it until late in the 18th century).  They founded modern Western philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, and logic. Barbara and I walked across a patch of ground called the Ancient Agora and realized that &lt;i&gt;this was where Socrates taught&lt;/i&gt;.  It is unbelievable.  And then you climb up to the Acropolis and see the Parthenon and you realize it's unbelievably more unbelievable than you ever believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did I identify anything linguistic enough to justify putting this postcard on Language Log?  Not really.  But Barbara and I did have a giggle each day as we flipped the Do Not Disturb card on our door handle to signal that our hotel room was ready for cleaning. The hotel had not appreciated the vital nature of the little particle &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, and they had printed on the card the words &lt;b&gt;Make My Room&lt;/b&gt;.  Somehow, since Clint Eastwood's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Impact"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sudden Impact&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (filmed in Santa Cruz), that seemed very funny ("Go ahead!").  I have no idea why &lt;i&gt;make up the bed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;make the bed&lt;/i&gt; are basically equivalent but &lt;i&gt;make up the room&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;make the room&lt;/i&gt; are not.  Not everything about English syntax and semantics is regular and logically explicable.  Some of it is as messy and lawless and unpredictable as Athens traffic or Dirty Harry's policing methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Running for election!&lt;/a&gt; A newspaper story neatly summarizes the positions of many of the candidates, and here is a set you Nebraskans should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; vote for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Keller &amp;quot;wished creationism was taught in place of evolution, but should at least be taught alongside evolution&amp;quot;…although now that he has been exposed, he is frantically backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kirby Young, a candidate for the District 1 seat, and Andrew Ringsmuth, a candidate for the District 7 seat, said creationism should be taught as a theory alongside evolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gregory Wiltshire, a candidate for the District 1 seat, said he doesn't believe creationism should be taught in science classes, but schools should give students the chance to explore their interest in creationism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lanny Boswell, a candidate for the District 5 seat, said creationism shouldn't be taught in science classes, but those classes should teach students to be critical thinkers and consider divergent viewpoints."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Norman Dority, seeking the District 5 seat, said schools should present theories of creationism and evolution but should not dictate how they are taught."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Andrew Ringsmuth: candidate for District 7 seat: Ringsmuth said, at the high school level, evolution should be taught as a theory that many, but not all, scientists support. He said teachers should be allowed to give students a chance to explore creationism, intelligent design and evolution and decide for themselves which theory they support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller is a particularly interesting case: he was endorsed by the Lincoln Education Association's PAC. They're trying to rationalize it away now, but I think they should send a clearer message and remove their endorsement. I'm sorry, but people as ignorant as the ones listed above have no place in managing a school system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost — there are a few candidates with sensible positions. These are the ones you should vote for, Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kathy Danek: candidate for re-election to her District 1 seat: She doesn't support incorporating creationism, which she considers a religious belief, in science curriculum. She said she could see creationism being used as a topic in a student debate class or activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Barb Baier: candidate for District 3 seat: Baier said creationism should not be taught in science classes. She said she considers it a philosophy, not a form of science, but could see it being taught in a philosophy or literature course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don Mayhew: candidate for re-election to his district 7 seat: Mayhew said neither creationism nor intelligent design is based on the scientific method and that he doesn't support teaching either concept in science classes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three people gave good answers, and four seats are open. It sounds like at least one useless dingleberry is going to get a voice in Nebraska education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, in addition to &lt;i&gt;voting&lt;/i&gt; for pro-science candidates, maybe a few more of you scientifically minded Nebraskans need to start &lt;i&gt;running&lt;/i&gt; for these positions. The kooks always seem anxious to rise up and poison education, but the sensible people always assume it's going to be fine and that they don't need to exert themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Its name, Vinterbrinken ("Winter Slope"), survives in a nearby street name, though few know that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house was built by the railroad company in the 1890s and was torn down, along with its barn, in the 1950s. The municipal archives have photographs of the buildings and the people who lived there, and they are all known by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, the staff at a nearby daycare centre has been taking the kids down to the site and had them excavate parts of it, collecting hundreds of objects from the middens and demolition debris. They have now put on an exhibition at Fisksätra public library, displaying selected finds along with drawings by the kids with their own comments and interpretations, and offering some literature about the area (including &lt;a href="http://www.algonet.se/~arador/fiskis-hist.html"&gt;a paper of mine&lt;/a&gt;.) In the display case are for instance parts of two pocket watches and a uniform button with the old Swedish Rail logotype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These excavations are illegal. I don't think they should be, but they are. When the librarians told me about what was happening at Vinterbrinken and slightly guardedly asked me what I thought about it, that's what I replied. Swedish law offers blanket protection for all remains of human activity "in the past" provided that they are permanently abandoned. But that's not how the law is applied in practice. We rarely bother to dig anything later than the 18th century. In fact, I believe the National Heritage Board sees this disparity between heritage protection &lt;i&gt;de jure&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; as quite a problem. Could we phrase the law in such a manner that we get good protection but only for important stuff? The issue is clouded by the fact that not everyone agrees on what is important, and that ideas change over time even among heritage managers themselves. The tendency over the decades has been for more and more categories of site, later and later ones, and less and less impressive ones, to receive protection in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/museum_catalogues_ice_cream_st.php"&gt;mentioned here recently&lt;/a&gt;, I certainly don't want our museums to spend their meagre resources collecting modern trash. And I am personally not interested in any of the archaeological questions the Vinterbrinken site might be able to answer if the daycare kids quit looting it. What do I care about the everyday minutiae of life in an early-20th century rail man's homestead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a suspicion that there may be quite a few people who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; interested in that sort of thing. Not least the members of &lt;a href="http://www.cybis.se/mv15/"&gt;Föreningen Motorvagnen&lt;/a&gt;, the Saltsjöbanan railroad's old-boys association, who spend loads of time and effort restoring old carriages and organising rides. But then again, the old boys probably aren't aware of the amount of information a competent excavation team could coax out of the site. Perhaps they're quite happy just to see the finds in the display case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/04/daycare_looters.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/ZH6LkDsUF4E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238680866996"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/hard_conversations.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7787688c9a97dcd2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Hard conversations</title><published>2009-04-02T14:00:22Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T14:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/T1wkkad_Cv8/hard_conversations.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/hard_conversations.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was long and rough, with the day spent desperately trying to finish a grant application and the evening spent in obedience training with our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/bailey_discovers_squirrels.php"&gt;new dog Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, who, let's face it, needs more than a bit of doggie discipline. By the time I got home, had dinner, and was checking e-mail, it was pretty late and--gasp!--I didn't really feel like blogging. Yes I'm aware of that study that claims to link vinyl floors to autism that everyone's been sending me; perhaps I'll get to it tomorrow. Last night it was just too late and I was too tired to try to tackle reading a research paper and writing up a commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lieu of more of bestowing more of Orac's scintillating (or overwrought) pearls of wisdom, upon his eager fans, I sometimes like to point out new and potentially interesting blogs. In this case, it's a medical student who's just started his blog up. At when a blog is at such an embryonic stage, it's always difficult to tell if the blogger will stick to it, but in this case the initial posts look promising. The blog is called &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com/"&gt;Beyond the Short Coat&lt;/a&gt;, and the blogger, Whitecoat Tales, has begun a series called &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com/category/hard-conversations/"&gt;Hard Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, which he describes thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to be clear; there isn't any scientific controversy in what I'll be writing about, only media hype. I'm calling them "Hard Conversations" because I will be discussing things people hold strong and cherished beliefs about, in long, generally multi-part posts. Often we'll be discussing things people hold responsible for their own pain and suffering. For example the first Conversation will be about vaccines and autism. I understand just how polarizing these issues can be. I'm not aiming to just shout at suffering people and say "Can't you see the science! Don't be stupid!" I think a lot of bloggers do that sort of thing much better than I would. Make no mistake though, I will not compromise science. Ethically, and morally, I have an obligation to explain these issues to the best understanding we have in the medical world. I'm not going to pander to people who specialize, knowingly or unknowingly, in giving people false hope or false beliefs to make money, or for their own perverse pleasure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that he doesn't get the impression that I do the Orac schtick when I'm talking to patients. When I encounter a woman who is in the thrall of cancer quackery I certainly don't go full Orac on her. Blogging is an outlet meant to satisfy my urge to write and (hopefully) educate about science, medicine, and skepticism. It's a different media. That's not to say that the message isn't the same when dealing with such patients. I make no bones about it when explaining, for example, that homeopathy is bunk and why, but I do it gently but firmly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And his first "Hard Conversation" is &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/hard-conversations-vaccines-and-autism-part-1/"&gt;Vaccines and Autism, part 1&lt;/a&gt;. Please check it out and comment.&lt;br&gt;

Not surprising, and I’m sure it won’t be a big deal. Still, don’t try this at home, folks. Thanks to Kevin Conod for the tip.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-04-01.html#feature"&gt;This story almost speaks for itself&lt;/a&gt;: by tying some long-lasting flares to helium balloons and releasing them, two skeptics from New Jersey made fools out local and national media, including the thoroughly awful &amp;quot;UFO Hunters&amp;quot; show on the increasingly ill-named History Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this story! It has all the features told breathlessly in UFO reports: distant lights, flying in formation, appearing to hover, then suddenly taking off. All of this from flares tied to a balloon! My favorite part was testimony from a pilot (who claimed on camera the lights shot off to the side), because UFO experts love to trot out pilots, saying they spend so much time looking at the sky there’s &lt;strong&gt;no way&lt;/strong&gt; they could be mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/GA/ga-craft.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2006/ufo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look: anyone can misidentify stuff in the sky, especially when what you’re seeing doesn’t fit into what you’re used to. It’s happened to me, and it’s happened to lots of folks. Whenever some so-called &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; says that there’s no way flares could behave this way… well, you’ll know better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything that glisters is gold, and not every light in the sky is an alien just dying to eat the back end of a cow or poke you in the privates. That’s the kind of thing you’d hope people would have figured out by now, but this story proves conclusively that we’ll have to keep saying it forever.&lt;/p&gt;

The book’s author, Jie Jack Li, is a medicinal chemist who meticulously reviews the history relevant to the discovery of lipid-lowering drugs. He spares no details, even recounting the amusing quarrels and quirks of the scientists engaged in the “apocryphal showdowns” leading to the manufacture of cholesterol in a laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personalities of the various scientists and Nobel laureates described in the book are highly entertaining. From beating one another with umbrellas, to insisting on wearing blue clothing only, to egos so large and unappealing as to empty an entire academic center of all its promising young recruits, one has the distinct impression that brilliance does not go hand-in-hand with grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, each of these scientists did seem to share a common approach to research: carefully testing hypotheses, repeating peer study results to confirm them, and patiently exploring complex biochemical pathways over periods of decades. The physicians, physicists, and chemists showed an incredible ability to doggedly pursue answers to specific questions – understanding that the results might influence human health. But even more importantly, they were each willing to invest their careers in analysis that may never lead to anything more than a dead end. In fact, the book is full of examples of great ideas, developed over decades, that did not lead to a marketable drug. In some cases the research was halted due to lack of efficacy, in others political forces or personal whims influenced the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me about the scientists described in &lt;em&gt;Triumph of the Heart&lt;/em&gt;, is how rare it is nowadays for people to have the sort of patience required for laboratory work. In an age where kids suffer from iPhone and video game addictions, young adults expect a relaxed work environment with high salaries and no accountability, and adults are flummoxed by stores that are not open 24 hours… who has time for the hard work of science? Even The Onion, my favorite spoof newspaper, mocks &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/everything_taking_too_long"&gt;modern attention spans&lt;/a&gt; calling science “&lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/38575"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Triumph of the Heart&lt;/em&gt; is about much more than the discovery and development of statins. It traces the historical development of the first antibiotics, pain medicines, diuretics, and steroids, the rise, fall and merger of drug companies, patent wars, the unethical conduct of some researchers, and the financial pressures that shaped the industry, both in the U.S. and abroad. Other than Mr. Li’s inability to resist his chemist’s urge to delve into advanced concepts in organic chemistry (around mid-book) as a physician I found &lt;em&gt;Triumph of the Heart&lt;/em&gt; to be quite interesting, and well researched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important take away, however, is that science is about hard work, attention to detail, innovative thinking, advanced analytic skills, serendipity, and the patience of Job. These qualities are rarely found in alternative medicine practitioners (or their research) – which is why they have contributed very little, beyond placebo, to the advancement of medicine. &lt;em&gt;Triumph of the Heart&lt;/em&gt; reminds us all what good science is about, and how life-saving discoveries are made.&lt;/p&gt;

Take any one of these premises and support it. Continue. It won't take long at all before you reach a premise that you can't justify scientifically, and a short time after that you'll find a premise you can't justify with 'reason.' What then?&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree with Eric on this. But there are two things I'd like to say about it:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) This gets him no where as I've explained &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/04/dont-be-fooled-on-april-fools-day-take.html"&gt;in my original post&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this admission he simply cannot all-of-a-sudden bring into the equation the whole host of assumptions he needs to do in order to believe in the Christian faith. &lt;strong&gt;I maintain that a believer cannot drive a truckload of assumptions through a mere possibility once it's admitted that certainty is unattainable in science and in reasoning.&lt;/strong&gt; Simple assumptions, i.e. Ockham's razor, are better. For if Eric can do that based on his Christian assumptions when science and reason don't work at the level of certainties, then a voodoo witchdoctor or a Hindu, or a Muslim can do the same exact thing and bring into the equation all of their assumptions too. It seems as though the admission that science and reason don't work to produce certainties is used by believers like Eric with a type of &lt;em&gt;carte blanch &lt;/em&gt;authority to write any amount in a blank check when it comes to one's own beliefs. But this blank check approach fails the outsider test for it allows too much that other faiths would reject. If it's the case that simply because we can't be apodictically certain of much of anything means we can write our own belief checks for as much as we want to, then anything, and I mean anything goes. Let's just believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster or Russell's &lt;em&gt;Celestial Teapot&lt;/em&gt; at that point. They would have the same epistemological grounding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) When we reach a point where reason and science don't help us when trying to find the bottom of the rabbit hole, what we do at that point is we use our background beliefs to solve the question. Even though science and reason do not help us down there, we can still place that question next to the other things we believe and then have a good reason for deciding what to believe about the question in hand. Since we cannot investigate every sub-discipline of a sub-discipline what we believe can at least cohere with what else we believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But of course, this is what gets us all into trouble, because as human beings we believe contradictory things which we think cohere with the rest of what we believe, but we don't realize that what we believe is contradictory with other things we believe! This too favors being skeptical of our beliefs, all of them, to varying degrees (Quine's web of beliefs).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An important point I made in my initial post is that, science, and I’ll add reason, are the best we’ve got. They are the best antidote to wishful thinking, the best chance we have for getting it right. If we don’t lean on science and reason then anything goes at all, anything. And since certainty is an impossible goal then defending every proposition is unnecessary even if it’s practically impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve subjected a few of the most often proffered examples of beliefs for which it's claimed we have no scientific evidence for them &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-is-epistemological_15.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, and even when it comes to these strange possibilities I have good reason to reject these examples. So what if we cannot prove otherwise? So what if there is always a possibility that we're wrong? We’re looking at what is probable, not possible. That’s all we can do! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-588489550016700857?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Now that the votes have been cast and this phase of the conflict is over I wanted to give a  brief recap. Also, I interviewed Paul Murray from &lt;a href="http://www.texscience.org/"&gt;Texas Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt; for the SGU last night (this episode will be up on Saturday) and he provided some keen insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review, the fight was largely over whether or not to put the “strengths and weaknesses” language back into the standards that had been removed in January. This was voted down. But the young earth creationists on the board (there are 7 out of the 15 members, with at least 1 swing vote) managed to recover from that defeat by getting equivalent creationist code word put into the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new language that was put in includes that students must “analyze, evaluate, and critique scientific explanations” based in part on “examining all sides of scientific evidence of those scientific experiments.” Language was also put in to specifically question the age of the universe, the nature of stasis and change in the fossil record, and the complexity of the cell and information in DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without context, such language may seem benign. What can be wrong with analysis and evaluation? Shouldn’t students be taught to question everything? Of course they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific problem with this language is that it is meant to call into question scientific facts that are well established. It pretends as if there are viable alternatives to evolutionary theory or current calculations as to the age of the universe, when there isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real context, as Paul pointed out in our interview, has to do with science textbooks. Texas is an adoption state, which means that textbooks are purchased uniformly at the state level and then given to schools, making Texas one of the largest single school book purchasers. The textbook industry is therefore forced to cater to the Texas science standards, as any textbook sold in the state must conform to the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the creationist language inserted into the standard is as a setup to 2011 when the school board will select science textbooks for the schools. The language can then be used as an excuse to reject evolution friendly science textbooks and choose creationist friendly books. If successful, this strategy can effectively deprive a generation of Texas students (and even beyond Texas, as the industry will follow the Texas standards) of adequate education about evolution. That is precisely what happened after the Scopes trial spooked the textbook industry away from using the “E” word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the fight in Texas is not over. The creationists have essentially won this round, getting the language they wanted to be used in two years when textbooks are chosen. But the fight is not over. There is an election cycle in 2010. This means that Texas citizens, if they care about the quality of science education in their state, have the opportunity to affect the makeup of their school board.  The key will be in how the science standards are applied to textbook selection. The language is deliberately vague (to avoid any legal problems with the first amendment), so a pro-science school board could still choose good textbooks and be within the standards. While an anti-science school board packed with young earth creationists could exploit them to scuttle science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Discovery Institute ID goons are trying to sell this issue as one of academic freedom, it transparently is not. This is about quality standards.  Creationism is not good science - it’s not even science. Evolution and the age of the universe are well established science, and creationists object to these legitimate scientific conclusions based upon their religious beliefs. So they want to destroy the science standards that exclude their religious belief, and water down or remove from science those conclusions that conflict with their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think board Chair and young earth creationist Don McLeroy summed up the creationist position quite eloquently when he said: “Somebody has to stand up to these experts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is especially unfortunate when it involves &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=260"&gt;invidious comparisons in socially sensitive areas&lt;/a&gt;, but the problem comes up whenever anyone discusses properties of groups.  This morning, Stephen Jones brought a particularly striking example to my attention: an article in today's Independent, "&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/oodles-of-noodles-britain-prefers-chinese-to-curry-1660014.html"&gt;Oodles of noodles: Britain prefers Chinese to curry&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the crucial paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In a poll, 83 per cent of adults liked eating tangy Chinese, ahead of the 71 per cent who favoured highly-spiced Indian food. When eating out, Britons also prefer Peking duck to a lamb balti – almost a third of people have visited a Chinese restaurant in the past 12 months compared with 30 per cent who have been to a curry house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the language does offer us some choices, even without resorting to talk about quantiles and standard deviations. A better way to describe these numbers would probably be to say that Chinese and Indian restaurants are now about equally popular in the U.K. But the reporter (or the flack who wrote the press release) decided that framing the story in terms of a preference for Chinese food  would attract more readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in this case, the reporter does give us the numbers (if not the confidence intervals) right next to  the egregious over-interpretation — and &amp;quot;When eating out, Britons … prefer Peking duck to a lamb balti&amp;quot; turns out to involve a comparison between 32% and 30%, which is only slightly disguised as &amp;quot;almost a third&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;30 per cent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare the CNN/health article on innate differences between boys and girls, discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=260"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=261"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,  which gives no numbers with its generic statements ("Girls' hearing is more sensitive in the frequency range critical to speech discrimination"; "From birth, a girl baby tends to be more interested in looking at colors and textures, like those on the human face, while a boy baby is drawn more to movement, like a whirling mobile"), although the numbers turn out to be even less meaningful than those behind the "preference" of Britons for Chinese over Indian food.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238671473316"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20494433.post-7884070612264833993">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1de4851ed9c2061a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Dumbassery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="April Fools" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">April Fools Aftermath</title><published>2009-04-02T02:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T11:24:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2009/04/april-fools-aftermath.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/7884070612264833993/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20494433&amp;postID=7884070612264833993" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="html">Okay, it was pretty lame of me to recycle the same April Fools' joke I did &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2008/04/we-now-return-you-to-your-regularly.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, especially since I didn't even manage to write half as many joke posts as I did in 2008. In my defense, I'm much busier this year, and I'd planned on just writing off April Fools' Day 2009, but a couple of ideas presented themselves, and so I resurrected the ChristianSkeptic.

Today, as part of Eric’s blog book tour, I’d like to present a guest article by the author and a few blurbs about the book from other atheist authors. I hope you’ll take the time to check out this book. I think it’s time for secularists, atheists, humanists, skeptics (yada yada yada), to start talking about what’s positive about living a life without belief, rather than just spending time putting down the beliefs we disagree with. This book is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atheist’s Way: Living Well Without Gods&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; By Eric Maisel, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theatheistsway.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/8245/awcvrqv4.gif" alt="" width="69" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I see my new book The Atheist’s Way: Living Well Without Gods as primarily providing a roadmap for non-believers who are looking for an answer to the question, “How can I invest my life with meaning if the universe takes no interest in me or in human affairs?” At the same time, I think it will serve the many believers who have questions about their belief system and who harbor a lurking doubt that believing in gods makes good sense. For both groups, I see The Atheist’s Way as providing real answers and a vision of an “atheist lifestyle” characterized by personal responsibility, meaning adventures, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing the book, I thought it wise to skip the arguments for the non-existence of gods. Those arguments have been presented many times already, sometimes thoughtfully, sometimes thunderously. From my point of view is made better sense simply to state that there are no gods and to proceed on to the really important next questions. For the non-existence of gods is a starting point, not an end point, and merely sets the stage for the play. On that stage, human beings must make sense of how they want to represent themselves, how they intend to construe meaning, and what value they want to invest in the next hour, the next month, and the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Atheist’s Way I focus on meaning, because meaning is the issue of our century. There were certain other areas that I wanted to touch on, for instance whether believers or atheists got more depressed, what the journey was like from belief to atheism, and the long and honorable history of the atheist tradition. I also wanted to provide a picture of the challenges that atheists face as they deal with family, friends, and society and as they deal with their own occasional supernatural enthusiasms. But those amount to tributaries; the main river is meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have as your baseline the clear understanding that nature does not care about you or your species and that no spiritual enthusiasms are warranted, you must come up with your own language of meaning and your own robust vision of what your life is to mean or else feel bereft and depressed. In The Atheist’s Way I provide that language of meaning and I argue that the robust vision required is rooted in a certain paradigm shift. The paradigm shift I have in mind is the shift from seeking meaning to making meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years meaning has been thought of as something “out there” that, until found, is lost. It is past time to let go of that misconception. Meaning must be construed as a choice, not as a lost object. There is no meaning until a person decides to make meaning and to invest meaning in values, activities, and relationships. The flip side is that meaning is a renewable resource, since, as long as you are alive, you can make new meaning and engage in new meaning adventures. You treat your life as something in which you intend to take pride, you align your meaning choices with your cherished principles and values, you nominate yourself as the hero of your own story, and, by living this paradigm shift, you never run short of meaning again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, belief is a betrayal of our common humanity. As soon as people presume to know what gods want, decide to follow dogmatic laws provided from on high, and refuse to look the facts of existence in the eye, they align themselves against their neighbors and head down a slippery slope toward narcissism and grandiosity. There is no one grander or more narcissistic than the anointed believer who points to a passage in a book and exclaims, “God says you are evil!” It is time that, as a species, we stop promoting this self-serving arrogance. We must humbly admit that we come and we go—and that while we are here we have plenty of good work to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasonable people know that it is time to eradicate god-talk and dismiss the pantheon of made-up gods from our common discourse and our communal lives. But a multitude of these reasonable people, if they are to make the leap to authenticity and rationality, need support in conceptualizing how they are to live once those gods have been banished. I hope that The Atheist’s Way provides that support by painting a clear, beautiful and vital picture of what living well without gods looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Eric Maisel has given us a lovely, thoughtful book about belief outside of the narrow confines of organized religion. &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; offers an uplifting positive answer for anyone interested in how to live life without gods, superstitions or fairytales. For atheists it is a must read; believers should read it as well, so that we can get beyond the divisiveness of belief versus non-belief.” — Nica Lalli, author of &lt;em&gt;Nothing: Something to Believe In&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I find Eric Maisel’s writings more witty than Hitchens, more polished and articulate than Harris, and more informative and entertaining than Dawkins. A 5-star read from cover to cover! My only complaint is that Maisel is going to leave the rest of us atheist authors in the dust.” — David Mills, author of &lt;em&gt;Atheist Universe &lt;/em&gt;(more than 35,000 copies sold in the United States)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eric Maisel elevates the tag ‘atheist’ from a mere denial of the supernatural to a calling: a calling to a high-hearted life of diligence, creativity, and ruthless honesty in maintaining one’s integrity in the face of uncaring nature.” — David Cortes, &lt;em&gt;Secular Wholeness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this book, Eric Maisel does what none of the New Atheists have succeeded at doing: elaborating what atheists &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; believe. Maisel invites religious believers to live life as an atheist would, opening their eyes to worlds a religious outlook cannot see.  For people who can’t even imagine a Godless outlook, I would gladly hand them this book and say, ‘Read this and you’ll know what goes through my mind every day.’ This is a guidebook for brand-new atheists and for anyone wanting to learn how an atheist thinks.” — Hemant Mehta, &lt;em&gt;I Sold My Soul on eBay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike many other books on atheism which deal with the question of God’s existence, &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; attempts to answer a different question: So you don’t believe, now what? How do you bravely face the world as it is and create meaning for yourself without the crutch of a divine benefactor? Eric Maisel’s wise suggestions, musings, and insights are a wonderful resource for your quest.” — John Allen Paulos, author of &lt;em&gt;Irreligion: A Mathematician Explains Why The Arguments for God Just Don’t Add Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>writerdd</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238670371688"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1287">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0431407fd6f0fb1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pragmatics"/><title type="html">Why "that would be me"?

For example, in the imaginary Q&amp;amp;A below, I might respond with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rather than B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;A: I'm looking for Mark Liberman.&lt;br&gt;
B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: That's me.&lt;br&gt;
B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: That would be me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, our comments section featured a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245#comments"&gt;lively discussion&lt;/a&gt; of this phenomenon. (As far as I know, there isn't any common-used term for it&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, so pending a better idea, I'll call it the TWBM construction, for "That Would Be Me"). Opinions differed, as they often do in discussions of matters linguistic, about where to draw the boundaries of the phenomenon, as well as about its meaning, origins, circumstances of use, and so on. In particular, Bloix &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245#comment-26443"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that "The point of the 'would be' construction is that it implies doubt on the part of the speaker", while I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1245#comment-26445"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about the relevance of doubt to the meaning of this construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A couple of small recent experiments have tested this question. Their results suggest that effect of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; on perceived speaker certainty in TWBM sentences is very small — too small to be a sensible motivation for using this construction. And also, the small effect, to the extent that it could be determined to exist at all, was positive. That is, in one experiment, the effect was not statistically significant; and in a second experiment, speakers using &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; were judged, on average, to be expressing a bit &lt;strong&gt;less &lt;/strong&gt;doubt than those using &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research in question was mentioned (though not described) in a guest post by Larry Horn that I linked to in my post of a couple of weeks ago. Larry's post was "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/005305.html"&gt;That would be in the modal auxiliary, Bob&lt;/a&gt;", 1/9/2008), and it referenced a 2008 LSA talk entitled "The effect of semantic modality on the assessment of speaker certainty". That LSA talk doesn't seem to exist in any more permanent form, but the same authors offer what appears to be similar material as Augustin Gravano et al., "&lt;a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sbenus/Research/Gravano_et_al_SP2008_twbx.pdf"&gt;The Effect of Contour Type and Epistemic Modality on the Assessment of Speaker Certainty&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of 4th Speech Prosody Conference&lt;/em&gt;, Campinas, Brazil, 2008. Their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In an empirical study participants were asked to rate the perceived degree of certainty of utterances that contained either the modal &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; or main verb &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. T&lt;em&gt;hat would be me&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;That’s me&lt;/em&gt;), and which were also variously produced with one of three intonational contours (downstepped, declarative, and yes-no question). We found that both downstepped contour and epistemic &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; made a significant and independent contribution to the assessment of speaker certainty. That is, participants rated utterances with the downstepped contour as most certain, followed by those with the declarative contour, while the yes-no question contour was perceived as highly uncertain. Similarly, participants rated speakers' responses with epistemic &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; as significantly more certain than those without it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper actually describes two experiments. In the first one, 12 NWU undergraduates judged the certainty of &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; in written scenarios, using a 5-point Likert scale (-2 = very uncertain, -1 = somewhat uncertain, 0 = neither certain nor uncertain, 1 = somewhat certain, 2 = very certain). Their judgments were transformed to z-scores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = (X&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;-mean(X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;))/stdev(X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) ,&lt;br&gt;
where X&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the jth judgment by subject i,&lt;br&gt;
and X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all judgments by subject i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first experiment, the paper reports that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The mean Certainty for stimuli with modal &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;was -0.13 (st.dev. = 1.11), and for stimuli without modal &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; was -0.03 (st.dev. 1.04).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This average difference of a tenth of a standard deviation, in a small experiment, was not statistically significant. More important, the small size of the average difference, and the large overlap in judgments, means that this experiment casts doubt on the idea that the dimension of speaker (or writer) certainty is relevant at all in choosing to use the TWBM construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second experiment, the same scenarios were spoken rather than written, and the TWBM-type punch lines were produced with three different intonations. A somewhat larger set of undergraduates performed as subjects. In this experiment, the average effect of &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; on certainty judgments was statistically significant — and positive — though again not large enough to be practically significant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/WouldCertainty.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The "Certainty" scale is in terms of z-scores again.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with experiments of this type. One problem is that  a small set of students, typically from a single class, is taken as representative of the entire English-language speech community. Especially in matters like the TWBM construction, where there have apparently been recent changes in usage, it would not be surprising to find regional, generational, class, or ethnic differences. A second problem is that focusing on a single dimension of variation can often create artefactual patterns of judgment — participants need to create and apply, on the spot, a theory about the particular set of variants that they are hearing over and over again, in the particular set of contexts in which they&amp;#39;re hearing them, so that the experiment may be testing their category-learning propensities rather than their pre-existing linguistic knowledge. And finally, conscious judgments about when a form would be used, or what it would mean to use it, are often strikingly different from the patterns actually observed in the linguistic behavior of the individuals making the judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, we shouldn't take such experiments to be definitive. Still, I'm going to take this one as tending to support my view that expressing "doubt", ironic or otherwise, is not what the TWBM construction is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the TWBM construction is not expressing doubt, what *is* it doing?  In order to address that question, I'll start with the description of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/em&gt; (which doesn't include any specific discussion of TWBM examples). I'll continue with a small corpus study of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, looking at the distribution of the CGEL categories, and noting the existence of a common usage that seems to have been left out, or at least under-emphasized. And I'll end by observing that the TWBM construction can be seen as a special case of this common use of &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While my irascible, sarcastic nature causes me to differ slightly with his take on positive atheism, there really is nothing in his approach with which to outright disagree. If all atheists were like Hemant, I don't think anyone could hate us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The long version is below the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was looking forward to this lecture a few months ago when the first rumblings that it might happen were beginning to surface. I love any opportunity to attend a lecture by someone with whom I'm familiar and whose work I enjoy (especially if I read their blog), and Hemant is another one to add to the list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like every skeptical and atheistic speaker I've thus far seen, he was extremely talented and gave a fantastic presentation. I haven't read &lt;i&gt;I Sold My Soul on eBay&lt;/i&gt;, so the exact details of his story were more or less new to me. It was obvious that he's told this story many times before, but there was no staleness to it; I'm guessing that he loves what he does so much that the story is new every single time he tells it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It helps that it's totally awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My favorite part of it was the guy who "bought his soul" (i.e. bought the right to have Hemant go to church multiple times). He wasn't, as one might expect, a crazy fundamentalist, nor was he hell-bent on conversion. He was a liberal evangelical, a former pastor who runs an organization dedicated to "making Christians normal," if I remember correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, this guy's whole MO is to pick a church and pay non-Christians a few bucks to sit through a service provided they agree to fill out a survey about their experience. He then takes his pile of surveys and (unsolicited, as far as I can tell) marches into the pastor's office, plops them down on his desk and says "You want to convert non-Christians, right? Well, here's what non-Christians think of your church. How are you going to fix this?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is pretty awesome, and I say that as a belligerent asshole atheist. "Hey, buddy, your church sucks, and here's the proof. You're making us look like dicks. Fix it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this former pastor (whose name I do not remember, unfortunately) picked out ten churches in the Chicago area for Hemant to visit and write about for his organization's website, giving the non-believer's perspective on the various approaches and atmospheres of the different congregations. The whole thing took off (of course, it took off earlier when the initial eBay auction got some mad publicity), and pretty soon Hemant had a book deal, and pretty soon after that, his book placed number 1 in a list of the year's books about faith from a Christian magazine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole story is just awesome, and, to be honest, I'm totally jealous. Don't get me wrong; I'm most certainly not knocking Hemant in any way. It's one of those "Dude, that is so awesome for you, and I am so jealous." It's a good jealousy. I mean, the guy is about my age, and he's got a published book under his belt and he gets to go awesome places and tell his awesome story, and people listen. How cool is that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, once his story was told, he reflected on how his experience led to huge amounts of positive feedback and created non-hostile interaction and conversation between the atheists and theists who were keeping up with it. The discussions that took place on his reports of the churches he visited were, for the most part, free of the ire that so defines so many internet interactions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then moved on to how the media portrays atheists (with a brief mention of this past week's Family Guy, where Brian is persecuted when he comes out as an atheist) and argued that being positive, defying the media's and the culture's expectations of an irate, hateful Madelyn Murray-O'Hare is the best way to deal with the media. They like to make atheists look bad, so atheists should make themselves look good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A, I did ask about this, because it seems to be there&amp;#39;s an argument to be made (which I made poorly, probably due to a near-total lack of sleep over the previous 24 hours) that adjusting the atheist approach to the media in a way validates their bad behavior. I mean, they&amp;#39;re always going to be able to find &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; who is a huge dick and happens not to believe in God, and as long as that's their MO, it seems to me like playing nice kind of undermines your dignity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hemant seemed to take my point despite my exhausted rambling, and his response was not bad; he said that one presenting a positive face for atheism must be clear about the dickishness of the dicks that the media chooses as representatives. If they open their interview with you with a clip of some deranged nutjob burning a Bible while screaming "God is dead! Fuck the Christians! Fuck the Christians!" then you should point out to them that that guy does not represent all atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That does, when you think about it, subtly call the media out on their bad behavior. Instead of being adversarial and saying "You media types are assholes and you should stop using the worst examples you can find," you're pointing out the badness of their chosen example and thus calling attention to their irresponsible, biased reporting. It makes the point not only that there are positive examples of atheists out there, but that atheists cannot be painted with a broad brush; most of us are individuals with our own views and attitudes first and atheists second or worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, I think Hemant's take-home message boils down to "You don't have to be a jerk." His final conclusion was (and I'm paraphrasing this from memory): "If someone has religious beliefs (no matter how irrational), but the are not trying to legislate them, force them on me, hurt non-theists, gays, women, etc., and their beliefs make them happy and create positive social behavior, why should I care?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a good question, I think, and it implies a wise strategy. It does not preclude criticizing religion, but it does preclude being a douche about it when you do. It does not stop you from recognizing the problems with religious belief, only from going out of your way to bother people who aren't bothering you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, I don't think anyone will disagree that there's a difference between the nice guy down the street who goes to church every Sunday, gives to charity, and supports human rights across the board and Bill Donohue or Jerry Falwell. Why bother the former if he's not bothering you? (Bother the other two all you like; a thousand &lt;a href="http://www.crackergate.com/"&gt;Crackergates&lt;/a&gt; is less than Donohue deserves, and I've made known &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2007/05/ding-dong.html"&gt;my opinion of Falwell&lt;/a&gt; rather explicitly). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On an intellectual level, yes, he's wrong, and I don't think anyone should have a problem saying that, but, in the course of everyday life, chances are it won't ever come up anyway. To quote Agent J yelling at a giant space cockroach, "Don't start nothin', there won't &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; nothin'."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One criticism: I think that Hemant, when he talked about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, misrepresented him a bit. Firstly, I just plain don't like to hear anyone use the word "militant" in regards to atheists, just like I don't like to hear anyone refer to someone as a "Neville Chamberlain atheist." It's all silly name-calling and out-grouping and it's not even slightly accurate in either case (but &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2007/04/atheist-labelling.html"&gt;I've said this before&lt;/a&gt;). Secondly, while he praised PZ and said that he reads the blog every day, he said he didn't agree wholly with PZ's attitude and methods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fair enough. Disagreement is part and parcel of living, and criticism is part of an open exchange of ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then he said that PZ routinely refers to all religious believers as stupid, talks about how belief makes you an idiot, and generally tears people down just for believing on a fairly consistent basis. This struck me as unfair, especially since Hemant said it only a few days after PZ posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/religious_people_arent_necessa.php"&gt;this criticism of a claim that atheists have higher intelligence than religious believers&lt;/a&gt; (though, admittedly, he does refer to himself as "militant" in this post, which, again, I think is dumb). A quote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am always so tempted to simply accept this kind of claim — it's wonderfully self-serving, obviously — but I can't. I've known lots of religious people who really are brilliant, and I also know lots of atheists who were sincerely religious once upon a time, and there was no sudden increase in their native intelligence when they abandoned faith. And yes, I also know a few knee-jerk atheists who aren't unbelievers because they've reasoned their way to that position. We live in a world with a range of intellectual abilities in different people, but anyone can be religious or infidel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is clear to me that PZ does not believe all religious people are stupid. He has, many times in the past, spoken very well of Catholic biologist Ken Miller. He's also said that Miller's theology adds unnecessary religion to his scientific claims, and I believe that is a fair criticism to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PZ will readily hurl personal invective at particular religious people who are generally despicable or just plain stupid (Pope Benedict, Casey Luskin, and Vox Day come readily to mind), but that's not the same thing as saying that all theists are dumb. I understand Hemant's message, and I also understand that he likes PZ and enjoys reading Pharyngula, too, but I do think he painted PZ unfairly and inaccurately when he brought him up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, though, I greatly enjoyed Hemant's presentation. I hope his message of non-douchey behavior hit home with some of the younger college kids in the audience. It seems like the "new" atheists (as opposed to the New Atheists) tend to get really up in arms really easily and have a harder time letting things drop; the whole thing is so new and exciting that they have to engage and attack at every step of the way, heedless of whether or not they're being complete dicks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a large overlap between that population and the people who say really old, trivial stuff as if it's super-profound and they're the first person to &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; think of it. "It's like, Pascal's Wager is totally stupid, man." Thanks, Jethro, but people have known that for a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time. It's like watching a baby when he realizes he has hands for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I hope Hemant enjoyed his time here in Lafayette; I didn't join the after-lecture dinner crew because I needed my sleep, so I hope that went well. I'm certainly glad he came to talk to us, and it was most definitely worth losing sleep. Maybe he'll swing by our neck of the woods again in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and, Hemant, I hope you didn't take my second question about keeping your job as a high school teacher negatively; I meant it out of sheer curiosity as it is something I've been wondering about for a while. It was a criticism of an American school system that cannot abide vocal non-believers and in no way meant as a criticism of you or your choice of career, but for some reason (perhaps, though, it was all in my sleep-deprived brain) I got the feeling that you thought I was kind of being a jerk, and that wasn't the intention at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tonight, Hemant is speaking at Stanford, tomorrow at UC Santa Cruz, and on April 10th at Carnegie Mellon. Anyone reading this from those areas should try to catch his presentation. It really is worth the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-2807151060313450490?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238660466580"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=396">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9acf20d24cc2c871</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Irresponsible journalism and mental health #119</title><published>2009-04-02T06:42:05Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T06:42:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/irresponsible-journalism-and-mental-health-119/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Bit of a fad for quack mental health diagnoses in the media of late, whether Lucy Beresford on the Daily Politics show, Derek Draper and Oliver James everywhere and now Janet Daley in The Telegraph.  Daley, a woman with less mental health qualifications and knowledge than Derek Draper, asks ‘Is Gordon Brown Insane?’.

One of the top highlights of my &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;trip to Greece&lt;/a&gt; was meeting Marilena and Emma, two mothers (you can read more &lt;a href="http://autismos.blogspot.com/2009/03/kristina.html"&gt;on Marilena's blog&lt;/a&gt;----though my modern Greek has a long way to go, for me to read her post and no, I prefer not to resort to &lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/"&gt;Google Translator&lt;/a&gt;). I "met" Marilena, who is Greek, a couple of years ago via my old blog, Autism Vox. I emailed her while I was in Greece and met her and Emma, who is British, the last night of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilena, Emma and I sat in the lobby of the hotel where I was staying with my students. I'd just actually met them, and I was far from Charlie and Jim, and I'd been immersed in things with my students on the trip (two students came down with a flu/bad cold in the midst of the trip, and various other matters that might occur with 15 college students traveling around Greece on a tour bus and staying in different hotels for a week during Spring Break). But the conversation with Marilena and Emma was as familiar ever: Get three mothers of special needs kids together and there's too much in common, we could repeat each others' stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The laminator and the rolls of velcro.&lt;/em&gt; (I have a big bag of velcro right by my left foot underneath my desk right now.) &lt;em&gt;Teachers who are well-meaning but who could maybe attempt &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_being_mean"&gt;something more than coloring, and coloring&lt;/a&gt;. A child&lt;/em&gt; really &lt;em&gt;into cakes. A child in a state of extreme unhappiness in the most public of public places, from stores to the street to the metro. The interesting, and sometimes delicate, and sometimes uncomfortable, responses of family members. The future: What about housing; who will take care of our kids?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilena and Emma told me a lot about schools and services in Greece: There aren't that many of either, and they're hard to come by. I don't enjoy working my way through the phone trees and bureaucratic obstacles in trying to get through to New Jersey's Department of Developmental Disabilities for services. I gathered that a day, if not days, were required to do the same in Greece, and that bureaucratic hoops were never-ending. There are (correct me if I'm wrong!) currently two schools for autistic children in Greece; there's a center instructing children and their parents about &lt;a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/subjects/8561.asp"&gt;PECS&lt;/a&gt; in Athens. Services for adults----housing, employment---seem to be very much up to families.Emma had been researching &lt;a href="http://www.communityworks.info/articles.htm"&gt;community microboards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.housingoptions.org.uk/gi_home.html"&gt;housing options in the UK&lt;/a&gt; and we talked about options that existed, such as they are and aren't, and about the need to band together, to prepare our children for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/preparing_for_when_im_not_there"&gt;when we're not there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation, that is, swung between the poles of the, may I say, adventures of daily living to the constant worries of the future. Pretty much what I think about all the time and yes, even while I was in Greece, away from Charlie. I wanted very much to meet Marilena's and Emma's children and am hopeful that there can be a next time (or maybe, Marilena and Emma, if you're reading this, you might visit the US......).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, as you've no doubt heard, &lt;a href="http://www.kintera.org/site/lookup.asp?c=egLMI2ODKpF"&gt;World Autism Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt; today. I've been reading about autism in &lt;a href="http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;amp;d=2&amp;amp;section=0&amp;amp;y=2009&amp;amp;article=121087&amp;amp;category=Kingdom"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE5301TL20090401"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. I kind of feel like I already had my day. The title of my course was "Ancient Greece and Greece Today" and I'd wanted very much to find out about autism in Greece and I can't say how happy I was when I heard from Marilena and from another mother, Angeliki, who I unfortunately was unable to contact before leaving). Yesterday I wrote about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/against_isolation"&gt;isolation&lt;/a&gt; and how often we've felt we had fallen deeply into it. Talking to Marilena and Emma made me feel that matters close to home and heart matter to many others elsewhere, everywhere, all across the world and that we're all on a long journey to doing the best for our kids.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238656124283"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2748">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/748bd78d3bc2713f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Abortion"/><category term="Stem Cells"/><category term="Catholicism"/><title type="html">Catholics Similar to Mainstream on Abortion, Stem Cells</title><published>2009-04-02T07:06:42Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T07:06:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/catholics-similar-to-mainstream-on-abortion-stem-cells/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/117154/Catholics-Similar-Mainstream-Abortion-Stem-Cells.aspx"&gt;A new Gallop poll shows&lt;/a&gt; that despite &lt;span&gt;the Roman Catholic Church’s official opposition to abortion and embryonic stem-cell research, most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Catholics share the views on these issues with American non-Catholics that these are acceptable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism. (Read “New Clues to Autism’s Cause.”)&lt;br&gt;
. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f___ing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course nobody seriously has to make such a choice because science has conclusively proven that vaccines have no connection whatsoever to autism. I have to say I’m disappointed that Time didn’t grill her mercilessly. It’s really sad when the Comedian Jon Stewart is the most hard-hitting journalist in the nation and I wish desperately that a publication like Time Magazine would look to a comedian to tell them how to do their jobs, because they are failing their readers and are, as Stewart once told Tucker Carlson, hurting America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Staten Islanders showed up at the St. Francis Friary on Todt Hill today to welcome the relics of St. Anthony of Padua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gold reliquary containing a piece of the 13th century saint’s skin was the centerpiece of a prayer service led by the Rev. Philip Blaine of the friary. The Rev. Mario Conte, who traveled with the relics from Italy, gave a talk about the saint, a Franciscan who was revered as a theologian and preacher. Afterward, people were invited to venerate the relics, with many stroking or kissing the reliquary and touching Bibles to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the worst writers in Hollywood couldn’t make up something this shitty. When you gather to worship a piece of skin from a guy that’s been dead for 800 years, you really need to consider professional help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512064,00.html"&gt;In a public statement, Richard Dawkins called the Pope’s comments about condoms “stupid.”&lt;/a&gt; Is this really a news story or is it an April Fools joke? We already knew the Pope’s comments were epically stupid. Everybody with more than half a brain knows the Pope’s comments about condoms were epically stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Pope is either stupid, ignorant or just dim,” Dawkins told the newspaper. “If people take his words seriously, he will be responsible for the deaths of thousands, perhaps millions of people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, as a huge fan of Dawkins and someone who’s listened to a lot of &lt;a href="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:X6KATPzdMhQQJM:http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/assets/contributor/dawkins%24richard_lres.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:X6KATPzdMhQQJM:http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/assets/contributor/dawkins%24richard_lres.gif" alt="" width="135" height="101"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;his lectures, this might be the least controversial thing he’s ever said.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll let him tell the story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was held in Discovery Hall on the Arizona State University Campus with about 20 people attending. This was the fifth SkeptiCamp based on a conference concept called BarCamp which Reed Esau adopted for Skeptics. Obviously, Jim had put a lot of work into making this SkeptiCamp happen. Due to the sponsorship from Skeptics Society/Skeptic magazine, James Randi Educational Foundation, and Center for Skeptical Inquiry/Skeptical Inquirer magazine, the cost was free. Actually, it was better than free. In addition to the free T-shirts, there were books and magazines available for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lippard.blogspot.com/2009/03/skepticamp-phoenix.html"&gt;Jim Lippard&lt;/a&gt; began by talking about SkeptiCamp. The first rule of SkeptiCamp is that you talk about SkeptiCamp. BarCamp has 8 rules and the skeptics' version adds 9th rule: "Prepare to back up all stated claims."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a live blog being recorded by Tony Barnhart (Magic Tony); replay it and catch all the comments from the Blogosphere that occurred during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

To the Scientist who said or did the silliest thing relating to parapsychology in the preceding twelve months. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Dr. Colin Ross, who can shoot electromagnetic radiation from his eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hum, well OK, I guess he qualifies.  What he’s claiming is very silly. I’m not sure if it’s strictly “parapsychology”, but he apparently is a scientist and seems like a nut.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m afraid the rest are not so good, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. To the Funding Organization that supports the most useless parapsychological study during the year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- The Producers of the movie &amp;quot;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huh?  The movie &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/"&gt;Expelled&lt;/a&gt; could not any way be called a “study”.  It was a film pushing creationism.  Certainly not a study and nothing “parapsychological” about it either.  Plus, the producers of Expelled are not a “funding organization”.  It was certainly a piece of crap, but a “parapsychological study”?  No.  And yet there were several actual parapsychological studies he could have picked from 2008.  For example, &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/03/dean-radin-distant-intention-healing-study.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.  So why didn’t he?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. To the Media outlet that reported as fact the most outrageous paranormal claim. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Late night cable TV stations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems a bit of a cop out to me.  If Randi wants to shame the makers of Enzyte then OK, but then he&amp;#39;s criticizing phony advertising and not a media outlet per se.  They hardly even seem that outrageous either.  Unlike (for example) &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/66896/EXCLUSIVE-FBI-psychics-turn-up-face-of-Maddy-killer-"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next one makes no sense at all:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. To the &amp;quot;Psychic&amp;quot; performer who fools the greatest number of people with the least effort in that twelve-month period. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Jenny McCarthy; who has written books and appeared on countless TV shows promoting measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy is certainly a bubble head anti-science moron who deserves to be shamed more than just about anyone else I can think of, but “psychic”?  When did she ever claim to be psychic?  And there are plenty of real (ie pretend) psychics out there who could have been named.  McCarthy could perhaps have been named in the next award - the most persistent refusal to face reality – that she certainly would qualify for.  But psychic?  It just makes no sense.  Couldn’t Randi think of one actual pretend psychic to shame?  Not one?  In the whole year?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. For the most persistent refusal to face reality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Kevin Trudeau; who sold quack books even after the government fined him for it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actually, I think Trudeau has a pretty good grip on reality.  He knows he’s selling crap, and he knows exactly how to keep making money at it despite numerous attempts to shut him down.  No, the people with the most persistent refusal to face reality are the ones who continue to buy Trudeau’s books and videos, despite the fact that they are complete crap.  But certainly not Trudeau himself.  Douchebag?  Yes.  Refusal to face reality?  Not really.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hate to say this, but I think this years Pigasus’s are a fail.  The purpose if these awards, I imagine, is to ridicule these bozos and have a laugh at them ourselves.  But that only works if the things the awards are for, are for things the person actually did.  If they are about a straw man version (eg Jenny McCarthy – psychic), then they fall flat.  In fact, the recipient could easily laugh back at these rather absurd categorizations.  I’m afraid this list just looks like Randi picked five people who had done stupid things in the year, and then randomly assigned them to one of his five categories.  Which doesn’t seem to make much sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read my &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/01/the-golden-woos.html"&gt;Golden Woo awards&lt;/a&gt; from January – in my totally unbiased view, much better suited candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2 - edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well Randi edited some of the category descriptions - the main one being to remove the &amp;quot;psychic&amp;quot; label from the Jenny McCarthy award (see Phil Plait&amp;#39;s comment below).  That&amp;#39;s certainly an improvement.  But I still think it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense to call McCarthy a &amp;quot;performer&amp;quot;, and I still think none of the awards (apart from #1) fit the category descriptions.  Admittedly it&amp;#39;s not a major issue in the grand scheme of things, but if a thing&amp;#39;s worth doing it&amp;#39;s worth doing right.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238646693486"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c97dc704dda69ae1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Katie Kirkpatrick</title><published>2009-04-02T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/people/katie.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Photographs show Katie Kirkpatrick, a 21-year-old cancer victim who passed away five days after her wedding.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238646662629"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-4915971231977221917">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/980b0fda03819aa0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Fuck Steve Harvey</title><published>2009-04-02T03:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-02T03:24:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/04/fuck-steve-harvey.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Do yourself a favor right now and press "play" on the video below, followed immediately by pause.  Let it load so you don't have to suffer through the whole thing.  Ok?  Ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the gist is that this is an interview with audience questions on the Tyra Banks show and her guest is comedian Steve Harvey.  He, for some unknown reason, wants to be the black Dr. Phil now and put out a relationship book.  Here, he answers a woman's question about how long to wait until getting intimate with a guy, then he expounds to Banks about what a woman should ask a man when they start going out.  Ok, so now hopefully the video is loaded and you can skip to the 5:00 mark.  He says he has questions for women to ask.  Then at the 6:00 mark he gets to his "question number three - the personal stuff" and he drops this little retarded morsel:&lt;blockquote&gt;...does he have a relationship wit' God?  You sittin' up here talkin' to a dude and he tells you he's an atheist, you need to pack it up and go home.  Talkin' to a person don't believe in God, you (inaudible), what's his moral barometer?  Where's it at?  It's nowhere....&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ok, so you don't even really need to listen to/watch the video because all you need to know is right there.  Granted, Harvey isn't any sort of illuminating thinker, but you'd expect someone in the entertainment industry to have met a non-believer that wasn't closeted.  I guess that's just the religious prejudice hung out, all pink and naked for everyone to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if anyone would seriously take relationship advice from a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey#Personal_life"&gt;three-time-married, sued-by-his-second-wife, I'm-going-to-die-of-not-surprise-he's-a-born-again-christian&lt;/a&gt; douchebag?  I think he's on the same advice-giving rung of the ladder as the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,1203,Christopher-Hitchens-at-Politics-and-Prose,Politics-and-Prose-Bookstore"&gt;maladjusted elderly virgins&lt;/a&gt; of the Catholic church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, you should watch that one little segment because when he makes the stupid comment, Banks looks a little uncomfortable.  There's a weird little laugh she does that says, &lt;i&gt;"Shit, I'm going to get me some letters about that..."&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, Tyra, you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/sQp_Ekr0oGA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;(h/t to Hemant at the always fantastic &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/"&gt;Friendly Atheist&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

The &lt;a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-us/news/article.cfm?mnarticle=new-zealanders-are-becoming-less-religious-survey-shows-02-04-2009"&gt;trends are all going in the right direction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a sharp rise in the number of New Zealanders with no religious affiliation, new research shows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a study by the University, 40 per cent of respondents say they have no religious affiliation compared to 29 per cent 17 years ago.
Just over a third of New Zealanders describe themselves as religious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds so lovely. Of course, it's not perfect yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three per cent say they believe in God (although half of those say they have doubts), 20 per cent believe in some form of higher power and about third say they don't believe or don't know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for writing to us about our scheduled Dateline NBC "Financial Fiasco" broadcast last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC's live coverage of the rain-delayed golf tournament (Tiger Woods came from 5 strokes back to win on the final hole!) pre-empted Dateline in the East and Central time zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a back-up show ran in the West, and the full "Financial Fiasco" hour has been re-scheduled for this &lt;strong&gt;Sunday, April 5, at 7pm Eastern/ 6pm Central.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you'll be able to join us then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20090401/hl_time/08599188871800"&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;sparred&amp;quot; with public health hazard (and &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/500-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced.html"&gt;2008 Pigasus Award winner&lt;/a&gt;!) Jenny McCarthy; I put that in quotations marks because it kinda sorta pokes at her, then completely drops the ball when it comes to followup.  She is a mass of fallacious reasoning, and I’m sure her new book, &lt;em&gt;Healing and Preventing Autism&lt;/em&gt;, will also be chock full o’ nonsense (since we still don’t know what causes autism, though we do know it’s not vaccines). But we do get this quote from her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Time:] Your collaborator recommends that parents accept only the haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) and tetanus vaccine for newborns and then think about the rest. Not polio? What about the polio clusters in unvaccinated communities like the Amish in the U.S.? What about the 2004 outbreak that swept across Africa and Southeast Asia after a single province in northern Nigeria banned vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[McCarthy:] I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant. If those diseases come back — and they’re trying — it’s not the pharmaceutical companies’ fault, it’s that of the antivax movement. And she’s the face of the antivax movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/i_really_wish_this_were_an_april_fools_d.php"&gt;Orac, of course, has more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Speaking of diseases coming back, &lt;a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_618654.html"&gt;there’s a measles alert in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Terrific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=link-between-autism-and-vinyl"&gt;A study in Sweden&lt;/a&gt; shows an interesting, though statistically highly uncertain, connection between autism and environment, specifically vinyl flooring, smoking, and bad home ventilation. The scientists involved are very careful to note that this link is extremely tenuous (they weren’t specifically looking for it, so they can’t ascribe any reality to it just yet), but worth following up. I expect to hear from the antivaxxers about this very loudly soon, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238627373895"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/advocacy-vs-science/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7a5738b9603ed3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Advocacy vs. Science</title><published>2009-04-01T23:01:45Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T23:01:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/advocacy-vs-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The advocate will pick up any piece of apparently useful data and without doing any analysis, decide that their pet theory perfectly explains any anomaly without consideration of any alternative explanations.

&lt;p&gt;The ICDR just initiated &lt;a href="http://www.icdr.us/stakeholders/index.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fstakeholders%2fSignedIn.aspx"&gt;a new web-based tool to solicit ideas and comments&lt;/a&gt; from stake holders in the general public,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year for the first time, the federally mandated Interagency Committee on Disability Research (ICDR) is utilizing an innovative Web-based approach to collect online disability research comments to assist in developing a federal disability and rehabilitation 2010 research agenda. This technology-driven approach gives the public a three-week time frame from March 27th through April 17th  to submit their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, registered participants will be invited to review all comments submitted and vote on their top ten concerns in each topic area during the one-week period from April 22nd through April 29th. Public comments from stakeholders are the focal point of the disability research recommendations in the ICDR Annual Report to the President and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All disability-related research topics are welcomed, including discussion about concerns important to the veteran and military communities. The ICDR is seeking comments with special emphasis placed in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Collaboration and coordination among federal agencies;&lt;br&gt;
    * Health information technology and/or electronic health records;&lt;br&gt;
    * Health disparities;&lt;br&gt;
    * Health promotion in the workplace;&lt;br&gt;
    * Employment and health; and&lt;br&gt;
    * Other critical research issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment period closes &lt;em&gt;April 17th&lt;/em&gt;, so if you're interested, consider acting soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238626879861"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_irony_is_so_bad_im_having.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cfe2bc826db969ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">The irony is so bad, I'm having seizures</title><published>2009-04-01T23:10:30Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T23:10:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/qDk_UqztLmo/the_irony_is_so_bad_im_having.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/the_irony_is_so_bad_im_having.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a stern warning (definitely including fingerwagging, with possibility of ruler rapping) against the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gRnVd7ssDm6nhpNvSJG50KROQ5Cw"&gt;heathen practice of Reiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use Reiki is to operate &lt;span&gt;"in the realm of superstition, the no-man's-land that is neither faith nor science,"&lt;/span&gt; the bishops warned, urging Catholic healthcare institutions, retreats and chaplains to ditch the therapy, which originated in Japan in the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it's their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They're making a product that's s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we'll use it. It shouldn't be polio versus autism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This scientifically illierate moron is actually advocating that children become ill with serious diseases known to cause disability and death. She then blathered:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f___ing measles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder if she ever took even a junior high school science course? The Blonde Boob is incapable of understanding simple science, and is spreading, like a deadly virus, her bilge all over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her handlers have scheduled a whirlwind &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/news-press/2009Mar-press-tour.html"&gt;tour &lt;/a&gt;to promote her new book (no advertisement from me). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will contact ever single one of them and tell them that they are culpable in fear mongering over vaccines, just as Wakefield did in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope every reader will do the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Us non-Americans have particular reason to feel uncomfortable about what the people at the Pentagon are up to. But I believe many here would agree that the DoD is not always acting in the best interest of the US public either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Sb has made an agreement with the DoD to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/04/armed_with_science.php"&gt;promote their podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Armed with Science&lt;/i&gt;. I shit you not. That's actually its name. You know, in some corners of the world we get really uneasy if we find out someone's walking around armed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a serious case of strange bedfellows. I wonder if Sb endorsing the DoD in editorial text like this is a sign of a cash flow problem at Seed Central. Was their money invested with Madoff? In any case, I suddenly feel a lot less proud of having the Sb logo up top on this blog.&lt;br&gt;

The sender or the volunteer messenger who carries it? Do they perhaps have a joint responsibility? This issue has led to quite a number of arguments between me and my wife over the years, and we still haven't resolved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal. Let's say that Jenny's in bed with a cold and asks her partner Anne to take out a book for her from the library. This Anne does, but on the way home she loses the book. Maybe she absentmindedly puts it on a shelf in the grocery store and it gets stolen, or she forgets to close her backpack and the book falls into an open manhole along the way. Who pays the library for the lost book?&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sender pays. One of us feels that if Jenny isn't willing to do her own running, then she has to accept that her unpaid messenger is only human, and thus error-prone. Jenny should pay. An optional generous thing for Anne to do here is to offer to share the expense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volunteer messenger pays. One of us feels that by accepting the task, Anne accepts responsibility, and that it would be childish for Anne to expect Jenny to pay for the book. Anne should pay. Indeed, anything else would mean that Anne abdicated from the status of dependable adult, and should be ashamed of herself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once ran this question by a group of Swedish on-line acquaintances and found that the ones who agreed with me were a) somewhat in the minority, b) on the whole less likeable than the rest from my point of view. Dear Reader, what's your take on the issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just added &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/Flascience"&gt;Florida Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt; (run by Brandon Haught) to my Twitter list, and one of the first things I see from him is a link to &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/973157.html"&gt;an article about The Planetary Society looking for a new home&lt;/a&gt;. TPS has been around for decades, promoting solar system exploration and even funding a space mission to test solar sail technology! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their California office is in a home that needs a lot of repairs, and they’re looking to move to something a tad more modern. Can’t say I blame them, of course, so if any BABloggees have a spare $3M lying around, there’s an investment opportunity for you.

The Minnesota Health Department reported Tuesday that "young Somali children [in Minnesota] appeared to have higher than usual rates of autism," according to today's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/health/01autism.html?ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sanne Magnan, the state health commissioner, said the finding was “consistent with the observations by parents,” who have been saying for more than a year that alarming numbers of Somali children born in this country have severe autism. Somalis began immigrating into the area in the 1990s, fleeing civil war in their homeland. The report made no attempt to explain why the children had autism. Its authors did not examine children or their medical records. They accepted the diagnoses — some by doctors, some by school evaluators — that admitted children to special education classes, and they calculated rates for different races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They counted only 3- to 4-year-olds, only children in Minneapolis public schools, and only children born in Minnesota. They drew no comparisons with Somalis in other cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last couple of sentences are more telling than they might appear to be. In Minnesota, children do not need a medical diagnosis of autism to qualify for special education programs. Criteria for an autism diagnosis by a school evaluator can vary; school districts might give a child an autism diagnosis with a view to ensuring the child gets sufficient educational and other services.  Also, the population for the study is quite restricted, being limited in terms of age (3- to 4- year olds) and location (children in Minneapolis public schools who are of Somali descent and born in Minnesota).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the report from the Minnesota Health Department pretty much tells us what was first reported about &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/rates-of-autism-in-somali-children-in-minneapolis/"&gt;rates of autism in the children of Somali immigrants in Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt; back in July of 2008. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/42201122.html?elr=KArksUUUU"&gt;Star-Tribune&lt;/a&gt; reports more specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation found that, among 3- and 4-year-olds in Minneapolis, Somali children were two to seven times likelier than others to be in special classes for autism, a brain disorder linked to behavior problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report estimated that 0.9 to 1.5 percent of Somali children in that age group were in autism-related classes, compared with 0.2 to 0.7 percent of non-Somalis, between 2005 and 2008. The gap between the two groups narrowed, however, over the three years studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota does not have a formal system to track autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/health/01autism.html?ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article quotes Dr. Magnan as saying that the study found "'strikingly low' numbers of Asian and Native American children in the same special education classes"; Dr. Magnan noted that "parents might not be enrolling their children in those classes, or might be sending them to private schools." Here I have to add a piece of anecdotal information. My own son was diagnosed with autism in Minneapolis as we were living in St. Paul at the time (1999-2000). It happened that Charlie's case manager from the St. Paul Public School District was Hmong. One day she mentioned that her son had PDD-NOS---she said that very definitely, rather than saying autism. She also noted that her son (he was about 6 at the time) was non-verbal and did not seem to be responding to any teaching or therapies.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/42201122.html?elr=KArksUUUU"&gt;Star-Tribune&lt;/a&gt;article points out that "medical experts told the Health Department that a fourth or more of the children placed in autism programs at school turned out to have some other disorder." If this is indeed the case, it seems more than likely that claims of there actually being more Somali children medically diagnosed with autism may be over-rated, or at least require a second, and third, and much closer look.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238618891275"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/its_springtime_for_molly_on_ph.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd62d80ee94512f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">It's Springtime for Molly on Pharyngula</title><published>2009-04-01T21:24:28Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T21:24:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/wYLEDy1DZfo/its_springtime_for_molly_on_ph.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/its_springtime_for_molly_on_ph.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I noticed that, in this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/what_are_all_you_people_doing.php"&gt;recent thread asking why you were all here&lt;/a&gt;, that many of you said it was for the community and for the smart commenters here. &lt;i&gt;Nobody&lt;/i&gt; said it was for my irresistible physical beauty and scintillating and delicate charm…in fact, I got the distinct impression I could drop dead and you&amp;#39;d all keep chatting away happily.

The reasons, of course, are very simple. She has become the most famous public face of the antivaccine movement, releasing a book every year or so since 2007 about how her son Evan has been “cured” of autism through the dubious biomedical treatments she’s given him and how it was vaccines that supposedly caused her son’s autism. Most recently, she’s releasing a paean to antivaccine views and autism quackery entitled &lt;em&gt;Healing and Preventing Autism: A Complete Guide&lt;/em&gt;, co-authored by Dr. Jerry Kartzinel. Dr. Kartzinel, some may recall, wrote the foreword to Jenny McCarthy’s very first paean to autism quackery back in 2007 and was properly lambasted by &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/10/jerry-kartzinel-and-lying-about-nature.html"&gt;Autism Diva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=682"&gt;Kevin Leitch&lt;/a&gt; for writing&lt;br&gt;
things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism, as I see it, steals the soul from a child; then, if allowed, relentlessly sucks life’s marrow out of the family members, one by one…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in order to appreciate just how wrong antivaccinationist are, it’s best to let them speak in their own words. Nowhere recently have I seen a better example of this than in an &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html"&gt;interview with Jenny McCarthy published on the TIME Magazine website&lt;/a&gt;. In it, along with the usual invocation of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;the “toxins gambit”&lt;/a&gt; and appeals to anecdotal evidence over science, Jenny reveals that she clearly thinks it’s regrettable but acceptable that infectious diseases will return because of the efforts of her and her fellow antivaccine activists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME: Your collaborator recommends that parents accept only the haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) and tetanus vaccine for newborns and then think about the rest. Not polio? What about the polio clusters in unvaccinated communities like the Amish in the U.S.? What about the 2004 outbreak that swept across Africa and Southeast Asia after a single province in northern Nigeria banned vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JM:&lt;/strong&gt; I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words fail me. Rare, I know, but the above statement is just too much. That’s right. Jenny accepts zero culpability for her role in frightening parents about vaccines and thus driving down the vaccination rate. In Jenny’s warped world, &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; children are acceptable collateral damage in the cause of promoting her unscientific belief that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a hint for you, Jenny: We already &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have vaccines that are safe. The government &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; listening to you and your fellow antivaccine activists far more than your pseudoscientific nonsense deserves and even though you are a scientific illiterate. They do it because you and your fellow antivaccine activists whose public face you have become are endangering public health on the basis of no good science, and they are trying to prevent that. Indeed, scientists continue to waste millions of dollars studying over and over again the question of whether vaccines are associated with autism and keep finding the same answer: They aren’t. It’s a no-lose situation for you. No matter how many studies exonerate vaccines as a cause of autism, you can simply say you don’t believe them. You can blithely dismiss them as “unconvincing” or as manipulated by big pharma even though you can’t understand them and have no scientific basis to dismiss them. Then you can repeat your tired demand for more studies, which in turn inevitably find the same result, after which you dismiss them again and ask for still more studies. If vaccine-preventable diseases come roaring back because your movement has frightened parents into not vaccinating, you can simply blame the government and pharmaceutical companies because they haven’t produced a vaccine to your imagined and unattainable standard of safety (i.e., absolutely 100% safe), rather than taking responsibility for own actions dissuading parents from vaccinating and accepting your share of the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, you are being completely disingenuous when you say that “if you give us a safe vaccine we’ll use it.” The reason is that you have made it very clear that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; vaccine will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; be safe enough for you and that no amount of evidence will separate you from your antivaccine pseudoscience. Regardless of how much evidence is presented, how many times studies are repeated only to find the same result, to you your Google University “education” spent reading from the dark underbelly of antivaccinationist websites and blogs will always trump science. Always. Because of the arrogance of ignorance, you and your puppetmasters always find a way to move the goalposts back yet again and always will. Clearly, you no longer even care how much of a &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com"&gt;body count&lt;/a&gt; your activities may rack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does TIME Magazine, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. Jenny describes her son Evan as having been handed to her “pre-vaccinated with a bandaid on his foot.” No vaccine that I’m aware of is given in the foot. The Band Aid® on Evan’s foot was almost certainly from routine blood tests done on all newborns via heel stick, like &lt;a href="http://children.webmd.com/phenylketonuria-pku-test"&gt;PKU screening&lt;/a&gt;. I think that quote alone shows you all you need to know about Jenny’s medical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, I’m doing some serious traveling to give lectures all over the place. Here’s the scoop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) First, I’m in Calgary, Alberta (in Canadia!) on April 16 to give &lt;a href="http://calgary.rasc.ca/petersim2009.htm"&gt;the Peter Sim Memorial Lecture for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The talk is based on my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s no charge for admission. So drop by and see me… and maybe I’ll be wearing my toque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Then I’m off to Amherst, New York (near Buffalo) to give the &lt;em&gt;DftS!&lt;/em&gt; talk at &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/amherst/events/guest_speaker_philip/"&gt;the Center for Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; on April 18th. That’s $10 for general admission and $5 for students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) From there I’m off to New York City (that’s a town not terribly far from Buffalo) for two events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3a) I’ll be participating in a cozy evening of wine and appertifs &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/specialevents/plait"&gt;with the NYC skeptics&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday April 19th. Space is limited (as an astronomer, I’ve always found that phrase ironic) so RSVP early (also ironic, given what the &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; stand for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3b) I’m very pleased with this: &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/programs/programs.php?event_type_id=3&amp;amp;bytype=1"&gt;I’ll be speaking at the Hayden Planetarium&lt;/a&gt; on April 20, once again mercilessly plugging my book. This will be very cool, as Hayden is one of the premier planetaria on the planet, and it’s run by my friend Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He asked me to come, and I figured I’d help him out; the poor guy really needs the publicity. He’s really been struggling lately to get his name out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) From there I’m off to Yale University to give a public talk on April 21. I don’t see a link there yet but I’ll post it when it goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any BABloggees in any of those areas at any of those times? I hope to see you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238614060660"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-13620174515151253">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/13a5a1e1aee7531a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Nobel Prize" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Nobel Laureate: Adolf von Baeyer</title><published>2009-04-01T18:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T19:23:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/nobel-laureate-adolf-von-baeyer.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/13620174515151253/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=13620174515151253" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1905.&amp;quot;in recognition of his services in the advancement of organic chemistry and the chemical industry, through his work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds&amp;quot;Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer (1835 - 1917) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the preparation of organic dyes from coal tar.

It isn't hard to think of ideas that were once considered conventional wisdom - "Women shouldn't vote," "People should be segregated by race" - but were eventually laid to rest.

Not just autism organizations who use pity to line their pockets during April need to be under scrutiny, but everyone, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I have blogged twice about disability simulations and awareness, first about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simulations_and_analogies_for_understanding_autism"&gt;yada4schools&lt;/a&gt; and again about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_awareness_by_demonstration"&gt;Northern College's awareness days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why analogies and simulations are attractive to me is because my experience of the world is so different from most people's that an analogy or simulation is often the only way others can understand my perspective well enough to try to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, disability simulations aren't universally loved by the disability community.  In fact, they can have clearly damaging effects.  Valerie Brew-Parrish writes in &lt;a href="http://www.ragged-edge-mag.com/archive/aware.htm"&gt;Whether their perpetrators realize it or not,&lt;br&gt;
Disability Awareness Days send THE WRONG MESSAGE&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Jerry Lewis Telethon, disability simulations should be abolished. The disability community should be as outraged by disability simulations as they are over the negative implications of telethons. Overwhelming feelings of pity well up in those who simulate a disability -- and pity does not equate with dignity. Disability simulations rob persons with disabilities of their dignity and self respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulations are phony. To "simulate" means to assume the mere appearance of -- without the reality. The reality is this: nondisabled persons can never understand what it is like to have a disability. Jumping in a wheelchair for a few minutes, wearing a blindfold, and stuffing cotton in one's ears does not make a person understand life with a disability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brew-Parrish makes the enormously important point that someone who does not experience day-to-day life with a disability--especially a disability one has had from birth--has not had any chance to adapt to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This point was clearly illustrated a few years ago when airline personnel decided to blindfold themselves to test evacuation procedures in case of an airline crash. The results were disastrous. Naturally. The airline staff had no training in mobility or orientation. Therefore, they erroneously concluded that blind persons could never safely evacuate a plane. Nothing could be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm disoriented in a dark place, I let my blind husband lead the way! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reconsidering my former stance on simulations.  I do still think there is value in being able to find analogies to build bridges between vastly different experiences of body, mind, and perception.  But do analogies and simulations actually do that effectively without negative side effects of pity or fear?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Brew-Parrish article particularly because she offers concrete, positive ideas for solution,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness Days can be beneficial if it they are done properly; it is important for the public to meet with persons with disabilities and to interact with us. Why not have people who use wheelchairs discuss obstacles and the need for accessibility? Deaf persons can demonstrate sign language skills, and blind persons can show proper travel techniques. The public needs to know we exist; that we are professionals, parents and homeowners just like them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to be aware of awareness itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Jenny McCarthy has struck again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="thestupiditburns1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/thestupiditburns1.jpg" width="400" height="455"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, given the release of Jenny McCarthy's new book espousing antivaccinationism and autism quackery and the attendant media blitz the antivaccine movement has organized to promote it, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/beware_a_wave_of_stupid_is_about_to_fall.php"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that a wave of stupid is about to fall upon our great nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the stupid has landed. And how. An interview with Jenny has just been published on the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html"&gt;TIME Magazine website&lt;/a&gt; in which she "surpasses" herself. In fact, so dense is the stupid emanating from what passes for a "brain" in that empty head of hers that words fail me. Suddenly, my favorite snarky analogies about  "black hole of stupid, beyond whose event horizon no intelligence or science can pass," "waves of neuron-apoptosing stupidity," or "the stupid, it burns thermonuclear" (or supernova or hypernova) all seem woefully inadequate to the task of describing the sheer magnitude of the stupid that issues forth from the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

However, after listening to the compelling arguments of the distinguished speakers who participated in the Heartland Institute's recent global warming &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/national-post-disgraces-itself-again"&gt;contrarian conference&lt;/a&gt;, we have decided that the &lt;a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=2789"&gt;science is settled&lt;/a&gt; — in favor of the contrarians. Indeed, even IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri has now &lt;a href="http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/04/01/scientists-worldwide-admit-global-warming-is-a-hoax/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that anthropogenic climate change was a massive hoax after all. Accordingly, RealClimate no longer has a reason for existence.  The contrarians have made a convincing case that (a) global warming isn't happening,  (b) even if it is, its entirely natural and within the bounds of natural variability, (c) well, even if its not natural, it is modest in nature and not a threat, (d) even if anthropogenic warming should turn out to be pronounced as projected, it will sure be good for us, leading to abundant crops and a healthy environment, and (e) well, it might actually be really bad, but hey, its &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/11/avery-and-singer-unstoppable-hot-air/"&gt;unstoppable&lt;/a&gt; anyway. (Can we get our check now?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fish is a fish, right? They&amp;#39;re just a blur of aquatic beasties that most people distinguish by flavor, rather than morphology or descent. But fish are incredibly diverse, far more diverse than terrestrial vertebrates, and there are significant divisions within the group. Most people know of one big distinction, between the Chondrichthyes (fish with cartilaginous skeletons, like sharks and rays) and the Osteichthyes (fish with bony skeletons), but there&amp;#39;s another particularly interesting split within the Osteichthyes: the distinction between Sarcopterygians (the word means &amp;quot;fleshy fins&amp;quot;, and we call them lobe-finned fishes colloquially) and the Actinopterygians, the ray-finned fishes. The lobe-finned fishes most distinctive feature is the muscular and bony central core of their fins — extant forms are the coelacanth and lungfish. It is this lineage that led to us terrestrial tetrapods, but other than that successful invasion of the land, the sarcops were something of an aquatic failure, with only a few genera surviving. The ray-finned fishes, on the other hand, are a major success story, with more than 28,000 species today. To put that in context, there are only about 5,500 species of mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii must have begun diverging a long time ago, and a couple of questions of interest are a) &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; did the last common ancestor of both groups live, and b) what did it look like? We don't have a good and specific answer yet, because Osteichthyes origins are lost far, far back in time, over 400 million years ago, but every new discovery edges us a little closer. What we now have is a well-preserved fossil of a fish that has been determined to be an early sarcopterygian, and it tells us that a) the last common ancestor had to have lived over 419 million years ago, the age of this fossil, and the divergence probably occurred deep in the Silurian, and b) this animal has a mosaic of primitive Osteichthyan features, which tells us that that last common ancestor may well have shared some of these elements. It is another transitional fossil that reveals much about the gradual separation of two great vertebrate groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu.jpeg" width="400" height="303" alt="guiyu.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, A near-complete fish in part and counterpart. &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, Close-up view of the anterior portion of the trunk shield in dorsal view, showing MD1 and MD2 flanked by rhomboid scales. &lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;, Close-up view of the dorsal fin spine. MD1, first median dorsal plate; MD2, second median dorsal plate. Scale bar, 1 cm.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may be a bit disappointing at first — it looks like Silurian road-kill — but really, that&amp;#39;s a remarkable good and useful specimen. The animal was covered with thick bony scales, and the skull was built of thick bony plates, and so while it was squashed flat by pitiless geology, the pieces are all there, and it can be reassembled into a much more fishy state. This drawing may be more satisfying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu_resto_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu_resto.jpeg" width="400" height="292" alt="guiyu_resto.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, Restoration of the entire fish in lateral view. &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Interpretive drawing of the holotype V15541. Areas shaded in grey are unknown, and are reconstructed from other early osteichthyans. ano, anterior nostril; br, branchiostegal ray; cla, clavicle; cle, cleithrum; drs, dorsal ridge scale; dsp, dorsal fin spine; et, extratemporal; eta, accessory extratemporal; f.add, adductor fossa; f.gl, glenoid fossa; gu, gular; ju, jugal; l.ext, lateral extrascapular; lj, lower jaw; m.ext, median extrascapular; mx, maxillary; n.sp., spiracular notch; op, opercular; pa, parietal shield; pcl, postcleithrum; pop, preopercular; ppa, postparietal shield; psc, presupracleithrum; pt, post-temporal; scl, supracleithrum; sop, subopercular; sp., pectoral spine; tr, lepidotrichia; vrs, ventral ridge scale.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it looks like a kind of armored, spiky salmon with a thick muscular body (and yes, I too wonder about flavor, and would like to taste a slab of that). It&amp;#39;s definitely not a salmon, though — the bony structure is a curious set of compromises where some features are distinctly sarcopterygian, some look like they belong on a primitive actinopterygian, and others are unique or show affinities to characters of ancient extinct fishes, like rhipidistians. This is very cool. What we see here are relics of an ancient common osteichthyan ancestor, which are being honed into the specific characteristics of the Sarcopterygii. The analysis of the totality of the animal&amp;#39;s features, though, place it more in the lobe-finned than the ray-finned clade. That places it on a branch of the line leading to us…a very, very old branch, making this your many-times-great grand uncle, or cousin only a few million times removed. Now my curiosity about a taste-test is making me feel mildly cannibalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu_phylo_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/04/guiyu_phylo.jpeg" width="400" height="253" alt="guiyu_phylo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The topology is the most parsimonious tree arising from a matrix of 23 taxa coded for 153 morphological characters (tree length = 292, consistency index = 0.572, retention index = 0.737, rescaled consistency index = 0.421). The numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap support (where the value is greater than 50%) and Bremer decay index (bottom and top numbers, respectively). Eif., Eifelian; Ems., Emsian; Fam., Famennian; Fras., Frasnian; Giv., Givetian; Gor., Gorstian; Loch., Lochkovian; Lud., Ludfordian; Prag., Pragian.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When you look at that diagram, what should jump out at you is all the  diversity in the Devonian, the so-called Age of Fishes, and the paucity of representative fossils from the Silurian…which is exactly where all the interesting branch points in the fish family tree are located. Once again, paleontology is a predictive science, and this tells us where to look for the next batch of exciting and informative fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

Take, for instance, this &lt;a href="http://orangepunch.freedomblogging.com/2009/03/23/howard-ahmanson-becomes-a-democrat-seriously/7929/"&gt;story about Howard Ahmanson&lt;/a&gt;. In case you don&amp;#39;t know who he is, he is an extremely wealthy Californian who also happens to be one of those Christian Reconstructionists — a follower of R.J. Rushdoony, who thinks we ought to have a literal Christian theocracy — and is a major contributor to the Discovery Institute and other evangelical/fundamentalist causes. So I have to read this with a bit of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY I REGISTERED DEMOCRAT&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
By Howard Ahmanson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
About six weeks ago, I, a known leader of the Religious Right in California, decided to reregister in the Democratic Party. Why did I do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think I was reading about the budget struggles and threatened purges in the Legislature, and I was getting more and more tired and disgusted of it, and I realized that, had I been a Republican assemblyman, I could have hardly escaped being purged myself. The Republican Party of the State of California seems to have decided to narrow itself down to one article of faith, which may be described as NTESEBREE: No Tax Shall Ever Be Raised Ever Ever. Now, I'm concerned about this constant tax ratcheting, but I don't think this is the answer. The Democratic Party in California, however, is now so big and diverse and all-inclusive that it has ABSOLUTELY NO PRINCIPLES WHATSOEVER. The Hollywood and San Francisco establishments within the Party may hold to some pretty detestable principles, but the party as a whole? I have not changed any of my opinions. There is not a single right-wing opinion I hold that some section of the Democratic Party doesn't support it. Opposed to "marriage equality" and freewheeling abortion rights? A lot of Democrats of color will agree. And also many of them will agree on the importance and social justice of vouchers and tax credits for non-government schools. Opposed to fiscal irresponsibility? A lot of Silicon Valley Democrats will probably agree. Opposed to "urban redevelopment" schemes that run small business and residents out of the way for the benefit of the politically important? Got a high view of property rights? Lots of Democrats, including Robert Cruickshank and Senate President Darrell Steinberg, agree with me to a considerable degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I describe myself as a "social conservative, an economic moderate," and to a considerable extent a property libertarian. By "economic moderate" I mean that the philosophy of "starve the beast" has failed. The beast will feed welfare and pork and starve infrastructure. If we want to confront irresponsible spending, we have to confront it directly. We have to confront directly the issue of the role of government and what we want it to do and not do. And when we do want government to do something, we want it to have enough money to be able to do what it does pretty well (at least considering it's a government), but we have to fight the mentality of entitlement. The whole mentality entitlement is dangerous. The nearest thing we have to entitlements are property rights, and they are to defined things that actually exist. And all other rights, in the end, depend on property rights; freedom of speech, religion, and press is freedom in a place, or it is nothing. I am not one to radically abolish all welfare programs, as I was in my wild youth - and Social Security and Medicare are welfare, whether you like it or not - but the attitude of entitlement, especially to resources that may not even clearly exist, makes it impossible to pursue any kind of a rational fiscal policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I may have made a rash move, in that it will be hard for me to find Democrats that I can actually support - there probably are some, though; social conservatives in the inner city, Democrats with an open mind to vouchers and tax credits and in other ways willing to confront the public sector union beast (I don't consider private-sector unions, for the most part, a serious enemy nowadays), Democrats open to fiscal sanity, Democrats open to property rights rather than "urban redevelopment" social engineering schemes out of City Hall. And by the grace of God, there probably are some!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not impossible that this is accurate — the Rev. Phelps was once a Democrat, too, and the Democratic Party does seem to have become rather amorphous — but jebus, this really ruins my morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best thing for my sanity is that I should retire to my remote stronghold, Chateau L'Pieuvre, and disconnect from the net until 2 April. Or perhaps I shall simply torture a few students with an evil genetics exam instead. I know I am not going to read &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/04/aig-merges-with.html"&gt;The Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt;, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/why_i_hate_april_1st.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Pcok-Vr6V2M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238595170138"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6815">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc120ebf6dc2404b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Disease"/><category term="incentives"/><title type="html">An Ingenious Approach to Drug Compliance</title><published>2009-04-01T14:45:23Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T14:45:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/FV1PdKsabBU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/an-ingenious-approach-to-drug-compliance/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Some ideas are just so great I am left in awe.

They’ve been traversing Mars for almost six years now, taking tons of images and great &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; data. And now I feel remiss, because Spirit has stumbled on something very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These images were taken on Sol 1858, just a few days ago (a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a day on Mars, about a half hour longer than an Earth day). Spirit has been tooling around a high plateau called Home Plate, because it’s shaped like, well, a home plate in baseball. There’s evidence that water flowed in this area a long time ago, and as I looked over the images it was pretty obvious. Check out this first one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3402671475/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3555/3402671475_5b90f0048f.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground is covered with granular material, obviously ground up rocks and such. A little bit of the underlying bedrock (the Mars folks at JPL — keeping the tradition of naming formations they find — are calling it Baltra) is showing through, indicating wind erosion, typical of just about anywhere on Mars. But I noticed that the pebbles look almost sorted in size, which is what you expect when water flows over loose pebbles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the next frame, taken just a few meters east of the first, really caught my eye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3402671509/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/3402671509_8a81b9facf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assorted rocks are all jagged, indicating they’re not as old as the pebbles. And they have an odd structure, which immediately struck me as looking like &lt;em&gt;regmaglypts&lt;/em&gt;, the little thumbprints or scoop marks you see in lots of meteorites. Then I saw the next picture, and bang!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3403482424/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/3403482424_f350e06fa9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=1962"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/spirit_meteorite.jpg" alt="Meteorite on Mars seen by Spirit in 2006"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWESOME!&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like a meteorite… and there’s precedent. Two years ago, Spirit found &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=1962"&gt;what’s thought to be a meteorite&lt;/a&gt; on the surface of Mars (see the image on the right). This newer image is higher resolution, presumably because the meteorite is closer to the camera than the first one was, just a little distance from Baltra. Note the similar structures, with some scooping, some obvious erosion-carved pocks, and even the color. This second meteorite — which is about 30 centimeters across — is a slightly different color, which may be due to different color balancing, or it could be real and from the slightly different color of the sand embedded into the rock from the pervasive winds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s still more! The ground crew at JPL commanded Spirit to rotate the camera to the east a bit, and in this image you can see the edge of the pebble field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3403482450/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3449/3403482450_79a0a628a9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the pebbles end and then there’s some sort of lava flow; I’m guessing if water flowed here a few million years ago, the raised lava bed there formed a natural (duh) bank for it (JPL named it Floreana), so that’s why there are no more pebbles. The grayish spiky things may be minerals or crystals of some kind; I haven’t seen anything like them in previous rover pictures, but the resolution is bit too low to tell what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the camera panned up to get more context for the previous shots, and this one seems to confirm the idea that we’re seeing some sort of lava:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3403482464/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3463/3403482464_133ae5cc12.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the right there is what looks like a spatter cone (named Rábida), a volcanic structure formed when lava spurts out of vent in the ground and, well, spatters around. The rock is rough, and flattens out around the cone. Clearly this is why the water flow stopped there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More clear evidence of past eruptions can be seen in this next image, located almost 180 degrees around from the first series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3403482496/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3444/3403482496_fa50981090.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layering of the rock may be due to periodic eruptions from the nearby vent, though they almost look like uplifted sedimentary layers (nicknamed Isabela); if water once flowed here a long time ago, it may have deposited material into those layers, and then when the vent formed it pushed up from below, causing the tilt. I see that same thing every day when I look at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Boulder! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, you wouldn’t expect to see a landscape on Mars that would literally remind you of home. But physical processes are the same everywhere, so you might expect to see some similarities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when the ground crew commanded Spirit to pan a bit more and zoom out (again, for context), it saw an incredible view that really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look like Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3403482532/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/3403482532_f8b41fb2d8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the lava to the left and the Isabela layers in the center, but the formations on the right are a little baffling. Wind erosion carves odd shapes in the rock (remember &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/01/21/speaking-of-dumb-mars-claims/"&gt;the Bigfoot on Mars&lt;/a&gt;?) so I’m &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; this is just another coincidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I have to admit, it looks an awful lot like the Galapagos Islands, too. Hard to say. It may be a trick of light and shadow, or just the time of year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238594629905"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0135f19198042201</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced</title><published>2009-04-01T12:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T12:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/500-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="250px-pigasusaward" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/250px-pigasusaward.jpg" height="198" width="250"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every year, on the appropriate date of April 1, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) gives out the Pigasus Awards, a dubious honor to people or organizations that have done their best in the past year to snuff out science and promote irrationality. The award is named after the beloved mascot of the JREF because, after all, when paranormal powers are proven, pigs will fly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The five categories of the Pigasus Award are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. To the Scientist who said or did the silliest thing relating to occult, supernatural, or paranormal subjects in the preceding twelve months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. To the Funding Organization that supports the most useless study related to the occult, supernatural, or paranormal during the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. To the Media outlet that reported as fact the most outrageous occult, supernatural, or paranormal claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. To the Performer who fooled the greatest number of people with the least effort in that twelve-month period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. For the most persistent refusal to face reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year's (dis)honorees are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1) Dr. Colin Ross, who claims he can shoot electromagnetic radiation from his eyes;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2) The Producers of the movie "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed";&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3) Late night cable TV stations;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4) Jenny McCarthy; who has written books and appeared on countless TV shows promoting measles; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5) Kevin Trudeau; who sold quack books even after the government fined him for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238594482083"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/striking_back_against_animal_rights_terr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/835fb59464e0b9a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Fighting back against animal rights terrorists</title><published>2009-04-01T14:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T14:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/jf-tXHHzUdM/striking_back_against_animal_rights_terr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/striking_back_against_animal_rights_terr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but as a surgeon and a biomedical researcher, I'm fed up with animal rights terrorists who threaten biomedical research with their&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/bad_scientific_arguments_in_the_service.php"&gt; misinformation about animal research&lt;/a&gt;, their&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/animal_rights_terrorists_firebomb_a_rese.php"&gt; terroristic attacks on scientists who engage in such research&lt;/a&gt;, and listening to the despicable self-righteous idiot who is a disgrace to surgeons everywhere, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/animal_rights_terrorism_revisited.php"&gt;Dr. Jerry Vlasak&lt;/a&gt;, spouting off about how assassinating researchers who use animals as part of their research would be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apparently I'm not alone. Scientists at UCLA, which, along with UC Santa Cruz, is at ground zero for the animal rights movement in the U.S., have decided to do something about it. They've formed their own chapter of &lt;a href="http://www.ucla-pro-test.org/"&gt;Pro-Test&lt;/a&gt;, and, even better, they've decided to get in the faces of the animal rights terrorist crowd:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/striking_back_against_animal_rights_terr.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/striking_back_against_animal_rights_terr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/jf-tXHHzUdM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238594480111"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6726">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/35d50ebf476e12a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 4.1</title><published>2009-04-01T13:44:49Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T13:44:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6726" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

I've recently defended it from some of &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/answering-dr-repperts-criticisms-of.html"&gt;Dr. Victor Reppert's criticisms&lt;/a&gt;. One Christian minister encourages believers &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-encourage-every-christian-to-take.html"&gt;to take the test&lt;/a&gt;! I also provided an example of what it means &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/outsider-test-in-action-studying-islam.html"&gt;to take the test&lt;/a&gt;. So let me just say on this April Fool's Day that taking this test is the best and probably the only way to know the truth about what you believe. And here's why...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's because of who we are. When it comes to the religious faiths we were raised to accept, it's not just that they may be false, which seems obvious, given their proliferation around the globe into geographically distinct locations. It's much worse than that. It's that, well, if Christian philosopher Victor Reppert was raised in a different home, and had different experiences, and read different books, and studied under different professors, and got a teaching appointment in a different place, then he could be an atheist philosopher right now, just as atheist philosopher Keith Parsons could be a Christian philosopher right now if he had led the life that Reppert did and his experiences were likewise reversed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deny this if you think you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's how bad it is when it comes to anyone who claims to know the truth about these issues, and that's how bad it is when it comes to the claim that we as human beings can think outside the box and reason correctly, objectively, and dispassionately, without prejudices or preconceived notions. We can't, or at least, if we can, the only thing we can and should trust is the empirical sciences. That's our only hope. Science is the best we've got, and even science has it's problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe what we were raised to believe, and we defend what we want to believe for the most part. It's really bad. It's terrible. We humans are illogical creatures, especially when it comes to these issues. All of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me put it to you this way, if you read everything that I have read and experienced everything that I have experienced, then you would think on these issues exactly the same way I do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deny this if you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there is only one way to deal with a particular whole way of looking at these things...by looking at it as a whole. And the best way to do so is from the outside, from the perspective of skepticism. If the opposite is being gullible then skepticism is favored by far, given who we are as human beings and what we learned to believe on our Mama's knees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therein lies the dilemna and I think I have a handle on this better than most anyone I've seen argue on the web about these types of issues. We are not the rational creatures we want to appear to be. As human beings we are in terrible shape on these kinds of issues. And since we know this to be true we should be skeptical about that which we were raised to believe. And we should be skeptical about that which we want to believe. It's that simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian, no, don't say I should be skeptical about that which I believe too. In some sense when it comes to that which I affirm, I already am! I affirm an agnostic atheism. Join me. Will you say the same thing? Will you affirm that you are an agnostic &lt;em&gt;believer&lt;/em&gt; (but isn't that an oxymoron)? In any case, if this is my problem I embrace it. Although, someone will need to explain to me how a skeptic can be skeptical about beliefs he doesn't have! A skeptic affirms no religious beliefs but merely says to the believer, "show me." Why should we consider non-beliefs as equivalent to beliefs? [Examples of non-beliefs: do you believe in the Eastern ONE, do you have a belief about &lt;em&gt;ilks &lt;/em&gt;who might live in the stratosphere?].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, it'll do you absolutely no good at all to pass the buck back to me. Whether I am skeptical of my agnostic atheism or not should mean nothing with regard to what you need to do, believer. Even if I am inconsistent you still need to subject your own beliefs to the outsider test. You still need to be skeptical about them. You still need to embrace the scientific method. It's the only antidote to the fallibility of the human mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-3943545193480847235?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, on the appropriate date of April 1, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) gives out the Pigasus Awards, a dubious honor to people or organizations that have done their best in the past year to snuff out science and promote irrationality. The award is named after the beloved mascot of the JREF because, after all, when paranormal powers are proven, pigs will fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five categories of the Pigasus Award are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;1. To the Scientist who said or did the silliest thing relating to parapsychology in the preceding twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;2. To the Funding Organization that supports the most useless parapsychological study during the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;3. To the Media outlet that reported as fact the most outrageous paranormal claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;4. To the "Psychic" performer who fools the greatest number of people with the least effort in that twelve-month period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;5. For the most persistent refusal to face reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's (dis)honorees are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;1) Dr. Colin Ross, who can shoot electromagnetic radiation from his eyes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;2) The Producers of the movie "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed";&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;3) Late night cable TV stations;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;4) Jenny McCarthy; who has written books and appeared on countless TV shows promoting measles; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;5) Kevin Trudeau; who sold quack books even after the government fined him for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of these prestigious prestidigitators are below. They receive no actual trophy, no prize money, no plaque; just the publicity they generally seek, though perhaps not in the way they want it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238590492428"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1286">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e477892fc6069056</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Changing Times"/><title type="html">Sign of the times</title><published>2009-04-01T12:30:16Z</published><updated>2009-04-01T12:30:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1286" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following sign is posted in a New York City shop window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RC1.jpg" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The words are Russian and mean "We speak Chinese."  One wonders to whom the sign is directed.  Chinese in New York City who do not know English would be even less likely to know Russian.  An awareness of the futility of posting the sign in Russian is evident from the 10 yuan bill that has been affixed at the top.  People from mainland China would at least get a hint from the 10 yuan bill that the shop is eager to deal with Chinese, though we cannot assume that they would necessarily be able to accept RMB for items purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the signage in and around the shop is a bit mystifying (click on the image below for a larger version, or right-click "Open Link in New Window" for an even larger one):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RC.jpg" width="475" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without making a detailed study of the words lurking about in the shadows and reflections, I see references to kosher, pharmacy, "White Chocolate Bliss" made from NAVAN Natural Vanilla Liqueur and Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur, and so forth.  These are all things that I'm sure Russian-speaking Chinese wandering the streets of New York City are eager to spend their RMB on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, the person who wrote the sign in Russian (or someone else in the shop) undoubtedly can speak Chinese (Mandarin), but almost certainly cannot write it.&lt;/p&gt;

In the US public schools require that all children receive the recommended vaccines. However, states can allow exemptions for the religious beliefs of the parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years anti-vaccine activists have been successful in many states in expanding the rules for exemption. In California, for example, parents may seek excemption if they have “philosophical” objections to vaccines - which means there really isn’t any criteria beyond the parent’s wishes. The anti-vaccine movement has been active not only in pushing for the weakening of vaccine requirements but also in teaching parents how to use the laws to evade vaccination for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LA Times found that, while state wide the exemption rate was only 2%, exemptions were largely clustered in certain schools. They report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, more than 10,000 kindergartners started school last fall with vaccine exemptions, up from about 8,300 the previous school year. In 1997, when enrollment was higher, the number of exempted kindergartners was 4,318.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ocean Charter School in Del Rey, near Marina del Rey, 40% of kindergartners entering school last fall and 58% entering the previous year were exempted from vaccines, the highest rates in the Los Angeles Unified School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herd Immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are concerning because they threaten herd immunity - when about 90% of the population is vaccinated then there are not enough vulnerable hosts to spread an infection efficiently, so outbreaks are uncommon. When vaccination rates drop significantly below 90% then herd immunity is lost and infectious diseases can spread, resulting in outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not mere theory - it happens. In the UK fears that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism (even after the original research by &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=474"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; was exposed as wrong, subject to undisclosed conflicts of interest, and maybe even fraudulent, and later evidence confidently showed no link between MMR and autism), led to a precipitous drop in the rates of MMR compliance. The UK does not mandate vaccine for entry into public schools, so they lacked the buffer (for what it’s worth) that exists in the US. As a result there was, and continues to be, a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/5081286.stm"&gt;resurgence of previously controlled diseases, like measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later scare that the mercury-based preservative thimerosal could be linked to autism has had a similar effect, and such fears rapidly spread to the US.  This link too has been shown to be false, and in any case thimerosal was removed from the childhood vaccine schedule by 2002, but the this has not stopped the anti-vaccine movement from spreading unwarranted fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was not as quick or dramatic as in the UK, probably because of the public school vaccine mandates, but still pockets of low vaccination rates are already leading to &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=363"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=365"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks on this side of the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of herd immunity affects more than just the children whose parents decided not to vaccinate them. No vaccine is 100% effective, and some children have medical contraindications to vaccinations. These children would also be at risk from those who chose not to vaccinate. Also, the public at large pays the price as previously eradicated diseases make their way back into the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skeptical of Mainstream Beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LA Times reports that the schools with high rates of vaccine exemptions tend to cluster within affluent schools. They report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ocean Charter School in Del Rey, near Marina del Rey, 40% of kindergartners entering school last fall and 58% entering the previous year were exempted from vaccines, the highest rates in the Los Angeles Unified School District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrators at the school said the numbers did not surprise them. The nontraditional curriculum, they said, draws well-educated parents who tend to be skeptical of mainstream beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They question traditional knowledge and feel empowered to make their own decisions for their families, not deferring to traditional wisdom,” said Assistant Director Kristy Mack-Fett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of overlap between such attitudes toward vaccines and those of some alternative medicine proponents.  Such attitudes do not reflect true skepticism, which is based upon a respect for logic and evidence. Rather it appears to be a countercultural philosophy - the rejection of ideas not because they lack value but because they represent the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a knee-jerk “tradition = bad, conventional wisdom = worse” reflex which does not serve these parents or their children well. It is also, I should point out, a logical fallacy - a type of ad hominem reasoning that claims that conventional wisdom is wrong simply because it’s conventional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack-Fett also gives the “empowerment” argument, popular among the promoters of so-called alternative medicine. This is a populist fallacy that counsels the rejection of expert consensus regarding the complexities of science and evidence and tells parents to rely instead on their own knowledge. Of course, this is often being counseled by those who are simultaneously giving gross misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I think that adults should have the right to make health decisions for themselves, and they have a limited right to make decisions for their children (until it conflicts with the state’s duty to protect children from abuse and neglect). Freedom is not the issue. The issue is whether or not it is good practice to pay appropriate consideration to the careful and transparent recommendations from experts or instead to rely upon dubious sources or the vagaries of information on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affluent parents, and really most parents today, have been lulled into a false sense of security by the successes of the past. Parents today have never known polio or measles outbreaks, so they downplay their significance. The LA Times again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a parent, I’d rather deal with my kid dealing with measles or mumps and sit with them in a hospital . . . than taking your chances on a shot and having irreversible effects,” said Kim Hart, a mother of two in San Clemente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have news for Ms Hart - death is irreversible. Measles can sometimes lead to death. It can also cause other serious and irreversible consequences. What Hart and many parents like her demonstrate is profoundly misplaced fear based upon systematic misinformation. The evidence is clear and overwhelming - the risks from vaccines, while non-zero, is statistically tiny, while the risks from the diseases they prevent is significant and well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_the_outbreaks_begin_theyll_start_in.php"&gt;others have already pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, what this means is that California is the likely location of future outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.  We are likely to face at least several years of outbreaks from the damage to the vaccine program that the anti-vaccine movement has already done. If they continue to make inroads into the public consciousness they are likely to do far more damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=444"&gt;antivaccine activists&lt;/a&gt; deserve unmitigated blame for the death and disease that results from their campaign of fear and misinformation. It is frustrating that as the scientific evidence mounts to show that vaccines are not linked to autism, the antivaccine crowd becomes more and more vociferous. Loudness does not count in science, but it can have an effect in the public arena.&lt;/p&gt;

But hey, The Finnish vowel duration distinction doesn’t come close to what’s going on in a remote part of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really, really short /Ih/ has been discovered by phonetic scientists who study vowel duration. Phoneticians in East Africa recently have stumbled upon the shortest vowel ever known to humankind. They discovered that the duration of the  /Ih/ vowel, already known for its &lt;a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/formants/table-7.htm"&gt;very short length&lt;/a&gt; in languages like English (to say nothing about it’s tremendous importance in Finnish), is produced in .11 hundredths of a second by a small band of speakers of Kwatnaksa, who live on an otherwise unoccupied island in the Indian Ocean.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Well, at least linguists thought the name of that language was Kwatnaksa, but never before had they noticed the very short /Ih/ squeezed between the /t/ and the /n/, and also obtruding effortlessly but noiselessly into other hitherto believed consonant clusters. They were shocked, therefore, when a 98 year-old native, speech slowed by age, clearly produced the vowel /Ih/, with an extremely short duration in all such contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When extensively interviewed, the old man answered with an abundance of very brief /Ih/ sounds in the middle of what the research team had hitherto believed to be consonant clusters. Intensive research quickly followed, revealing that the name of that language is actually Kiwatinakisa, sending National Geographic cartographers into a frenzy. “Once we started listening for that very short /Ih/, we began to hear it everywhere,” said Dr. Brno Von Hurringville III, one of the lead researchers on the team. “In fact, there appear to be no consonant clusters at all in this God-forsaken language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puzzled about what to do about their discovery, the research team promptly requested help from the Tanzanian Overseeing Council on Vowels and Consonants (TOCOVAC), at its headquarters in Arusha. Sadly, the researchers report, they have not yet received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an apparently misguided effort to preserve the until-now perceived original spelling of Kwatnaksa, a UN disaster relief agency has offered immediate aid, promising to send in a supply of speech therapists and to provide dozens of much needed consonant clusters to this bleak Tanzanian island. It remains unclear to most observers whether TOCOVAC will accept this kind humanitarian offer, but some feel that there are strong indications that it is not likely to be received kindly. One clue is that the UN’s offer was addressed to:&lt;br&gt;

There will also be additional budget adjustments, according to executive offices on the penthouse floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduced pay for non-union employees, including top executives, will become effective April 1. Several writers have been offered early retirement but at the time of this writing, management has not received responses from any of them. Anonymous sources say that the writers instead demand that the executives return all huge bonuses that they received at the end of the past fiscal year.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what is meant by “additional budget adjustments”, one unnamed official said that it probably will mean eliminating spell-checking and proof reading. “Smaller print size and shorter posts may also be considered,” he added, “and it is likely that we will start using the language of texting in order to save space. We also may have to eliminate punctuation marks, such as &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1090"&gt;apostrophes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some critics, language has been &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1167"&gt;deteriorating&lt;/a&gt; drastically in recent years and it is well-recognized that &lt;a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Lumber_Prices#Prices"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt; have reached their lowest value in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

The new corporation will be named AIG, for American Indulgences Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIG chairman Edward Liddy will become the chairman of AIG.  AIG chairman Ken Ham will be second in command and will continue to direct the Creation Museum, which will be renamed Credit  Management. CM will rate bonds that are based on credit-default swaps on a scale from AAA to aaa.  AIG will also subcontract with the Vatican to market indulgences in the United States.  These indulgences are expected to become AIG’s major product. The Vatican, in an ecumenical gesture, agreed that it would not impose a religious test on those who purchased its indulgences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham argues that redirecting his organization from young-earth creationism to voodoo economics is not as much of a leap as it might appear at first glance. Like creationism, free-market economics is wholly unsupported by the evidence: boom-and-bust cycles like the present cycle, for example, followed a failed experiment in deregulation. Ham maintains, however, that faith is superior to intellect, and the economy gods must have put those booms and busts in there for a reason. Economic theory, he says, is entirely faith based anyway, and he will from now on put his faith in derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinguished first-amendment scholar Reed Cartwright argues that the US taxpayer owns over 79 % of AIG. Because AIG is a religious organization, the merger could be construed as an establishment of religion by the government and will require a waiver from the Justice Department. Cartwright anticipates that the American Civil Liberties Union will file suit to block the merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liddy observes that AIG is, in fact, a nonprofit organization, and merging with AIG merely acknowledges its status as such. He will continue to receive his salary of $1 per year, but will be eligible for a retention bonus equal to whatever is required to maintain AIG’s status as a nonprofit. Ham, by contrast, will accept payment in the form of options based on credit-default swaps. “You could say I am testing my faith,” he says; “God is my counterparty.”&lt;/p&gt;

Sounds cool - but actually I did not find this to be a significant breakthrough. Other research centers have already achieved similar goals - remember the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=305"&gt;monkey that learned to control a robot with his mind&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda claims that their innovation is in developing a device that is painless because is uses only surface sensory and not implanted wires - but New York researchers have already &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59791-2004Dec12.html"&gt;accomplished that goal too&lt;/a&gt;, several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, this is a non-story (Shhhh….don’t tell the press).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda is a leading developer of robotic technology. So I guess they command some attention whenever they show a robot doing something. It is also likely that because of their robotics expertise they will play a role in mind-controlled robots in the future. But we need to put this unwieldy and clumsy device into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their “mind reader” can discern four states of the brain - when the subject thinks about raising their right arm, raising their left arm, running and eating.  This takes several hours of training with the subject. Honda showed a video of their Asimo robot lifing its right arm several seconds after a subject commanded it to with their thoughts. Honda says that their system is still too crude to give a live demonstration. Again - I’m not impressed. Not even ready for a live demonstration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they have crudely duplicated technology already developed years ago by other research centers. Sounds like they are fishing for investment money or PR. Eh - maybe I’m being too cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News articles speculate about using this technology to one day drive a car with mental commands. There is nothing wrong with this speculation - but this is certainly not going to be an early application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to consider is that there is a certain neurological buffer between our intentions and our actions.  We have to physically move our arms to move the steering wheel. There is a threshold of intention that needs to be overcome. By operating the steering wheel directly with the mind (depending on the sophistication of the reading device and software) this buffer may be lost. Operation of the car may be at the whim of every stray thought or distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason operating equipment like a car will probably be a late application, only after the the technology is fairly mature. In fact, there may never be an advantage to bypassing the arms and controlling a vehicle with the mind. Unless there is a physical impairment, the arms work quite well. I file this under “cooking with a microwave” - just because we can do something in a new fancy way, does not make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real applications (like heating with a microwave) will likely not be realized until after experimentation with real-world use. Right now we can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having said that, my speculation is that this technology will be most useful for, and will be early adopted by, the physically impaired. If one cannot move their arms then such a device would be extremely useful. Right now crude devices can already be used to move a cursor around a computer screen.  Once you can operate a computer with your mind in sufficient detail - a world of communication and control opens up even to those completely paralyzed. Such applications are also more likely to attract research money. And - such devices to not have to be as portable for someone already confined to a large wheelchair or to a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real point of this news item is for Honda to announce to the world that they are now in this game. Sure - they overstated where they are in relation to other researchers, and were probably jumping the gun, having to rely upon a video rather than risk a live demonstration. But it seems they are poised to invest heavily in this technology, which means they may quickly become a real player.&lt;/p&gt;

When I first heard about then 5-year-old &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/different_you_dont_have_our_vote"&gt;Alex Barton&lt;/a&gt; being voted out of his kindergarten class by his fellow students, who had been told to do so by their teacher, Wendy Portillo, my reaction was total disbelief. What was the teacher thinking? I've plenty of familiarity with "behavior problems" in and out of the classroom and of the difficulties of addressing these, but Portillo's action, setting students against one student as it did, baffled me. There is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_being_mean"&gt;meanness&lt;/a&gt;, you might say, and there is what struck me as a most unsound and unfortunate pedagogical "practice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;Portillo appealed her one-year-suspension and termination of her tenure&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/mar/31/judge-upholds-alex-barton-teachers-suspension-loss/"&gt;Palm Beach Post&lt;/a&gt; reports that a Florida judge has upheld Portillo's suspension for a year without pay and the loss of her tenure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school district proved Portillo violated the state’s code of ethics for teachers and school board rules in the May 21 incident. In the incident, she asked students to say whether Alex should be in the classroom while she tallied the votes on a board, Arrington said in his order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was in the process of being diagnosed with a type of high-functioning autism. His mother, Melissa Barton, did not testify at the hearing. But because she was listed as a potential witness, she was not allowed to hear most of the testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a step in the right direction,” Barton said of the judge’s order. Barton hoped Portillo would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least there will be some sort of punishment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge sided with the district’s assertion that Portillo exposed Alex and the other students to “unnecessary embarrassment or disparagement” and used an inappropriate method of discipline. She also failed to exercise the best professional judgment and failed to make a reasonable effort to protect Alex from harassment, he wrote in the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What especially troubled me about this whole incident was that students were made to judge another student and were, in effect, set in opposition against another student. That student, Alex Barton, was literally isolated when he was cast out of his classroom. But the isolation was also social and psychological, with Alex's peers directed to vote on him in a scenario more than painfully reminiscent of the public humiliation of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's &lt;em&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation is something Jim and I have long struggled against, and yet experienced, and painfully.  Whether we're on the spectrum ourselves or the relative of someone who is, we all have some memory of realizing that we, or someone very close to us, is being seen as "different," and shunned. I always find strength in the community and companionship of other individuals and families who live, as we do, everyday with disability----nonetheless, circumstances sometimes make it extra-taxing, if not just not possible, to get out beyond our own door and see and be with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was precisely to not be isolated that, back in June of 2005 when Charlie was struggling and in a crisis situation, I started writing about him and autism in a &lt;a href="http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Things had gotten to the point that it was hard to take Charlie anywhere and I felt the circle of possibilities for him, for us, tightening and tightening. Writing and sharing about Charlie and our lives in a public, online setting was an attempt to forestall isolation, to reach out and communicate. I certainly didn't think then that, via blogging, i'd come into contact with so many people across New Jersey, the US, and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recounted this story of writing-to-move-beyond-isolation to a student on Tuesday. She interviewed me as part of an assignment to participate in the &lt;a href="http://www.storycorps.net/"&gt;StoryCorps&lt;/a&gt; and I don't think you'll be surprised to know that, even while nursing a sore throat from a cold, I had more than a lot to say, and could have gone on and on and on. At the end of the interview, I thanked my student for giving me the opportunity to speak about Charlie's story and ours----I guess I believe that, by doing this, the isolation abates and Charlie's story----and Alex Barton's----get told, are hold, and will be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238569337190"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4218">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78a1851acb96316f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="freshwater" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Freshwater"/><category term="mtvernon" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Mt.

In this post I’ll summarize the testimony of the other witnesses who testified on those days, Lori Miller, Linda Weston, and Jeff Cline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 16:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 26, in addition to Ben Neilson’s testimony summarized in the posts linked above we heard the completion of Lori Miller’s cross examination (direct examination and the beginning of cross examination &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-day-10.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and the direct and cross examination of Linda Weston, former Director of Teaching and Learning in the district.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Miller cross examination (continued)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Millstone, attorney for the Board of Education, returned to the meeting held August 21, 2008, after Miller had spoken publicly at a Board of Education meeting describing her religious materials in her classroom.  Attending the meeting were Middle School Principal White, Assistant Middle School Principal Ritchie, Superintendent Short, and a union representative.  (Recall from her direct testimony that she surreptitiously recorded that meeting.  Millstone had listened to the recording overnight.)  According to her direct testimony that meeting had several topics, including an issue with her teaching license renewal having been put on hold by the State Department of Education.  In her direct testimony she had alluded elliptically to a “court case” and “charges being dropped.”  Under questioning by Millstone she said that three criminal charges had been filed against her by police after an incident the previous summer in another county.  Two of the three charges were subsequently dropped and on advice from her lawyer she pleaded no contest to the third, a minor misdemeanor.  She said that Superintendent Short assured her at the meeting that she would be in her classroom when classes started, and indeed her license was renewed by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue in the meeting had to do with her using a sick day rather than personal day for a court appearance.  That apparently wasn’t resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final issue had to do with religious displays in her classroom.  Asked by Millstone if she had advised Short of a stone with a Bible verse from Philippians on her desk, she said she had.  Regarding religious materials displayed, she testified that she asked if her Bible could stay on her desk and that Short had told her it could.  She said she felt comfortable leaving it on her desk as a consequence of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone moved to a post-meeting conference Miller had with the union representative.  He asked if the representative advised her that he had asked the union (Ohio Education Association) to do some legal research, and that the research showed the Board could legally require her to remove the Bible from her desk.  She replied that was the case.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone introduced into evidence a letter from Superintendent Short to Miller.  The letter summarized what she had been instructed to do in the meeting, and indicated that she had agreed to comply.  That letter referred to the religious materials displayed on her bulletin board, but apparently not to the Bible and devotional books on her desk.  (I didn’t see it, and depend on testimony for that description.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller testified that she didn’t inform participants in the meeting that she was recording it, and said she had legal advice to the effect that was O.K.  Asked if she though it was morally right to do so, she replied that she regarded it as “covering her butt” so she was sure what she was expected to do as a result of the meeting.  She testified that she didn’t view it as unethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Miller Redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On redirect examination R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, led Miller through a more detailed account of the charges that were filed, dropped, and pleaded no contest to.  I’m not going to summarize that here except to say Miller’s account of it appeared to exonerate her of any criminal activity but rather was more of the nature of a misunderstanding resulting in a minor charge that she pleaded no contest to in order to save time and money on prolonged legal wrangling and costs.  Since it was a minor misdemeanor her attorney apparently told her it would have no downstream consequences.  Asked if she regretted pleading no contest, she replied that at the time she didn’t want to but that the time and cost of defending herself then were too great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the August meeting, Hamilton asked if Miller asked the administrators about a rumor that a long-term substitute teacher was to be hired for her classes.  She replied that she did and that the superintendent assured her that wasn’t the case.  She speculated in testimony that the District Central Office was the source of the rumor.  (Actually, the fact that her license was on hold at the State Department of Education was known in the community, learned from the DOE web site by a private citizen – not me! –  and was mentioned on local Web boards during August 2008, when that rumor about a long-term sub was supposed to be circulating.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if she was advised by administrators about filing a grievance if she was unsatisfied with the instructions given at the meeting.  She said she was.  Noting that Miller had accompanied Freshwater to at least one of his meetings with administrators last year, Hamilton asked if she had heard him being advised he could file a grievance.  She said he had not been so advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding an issue over the use of a month of sick days in the fall of the preceding year (2007-2008), she testified that she had been in a hospital in Washington for a month after what she called “a meltdown.”  Asked whether she had talked with the OEA representative after the meeting, she said she had and was comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Philippians stone on her desk, Hamilton asked if it could have been at a different meeting she talked with Short about it.  She replied it could have been, since they’d had several meetings concerning restarting FCA last fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she was made aware that the Board of Education might change its mind regarding the Bible on her desk, she replied she’d been told that and inferred that the Board was looking at what they should do legally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton returned to the morality and ethics of surreptitiously (my word) recording meetings.  She testified that she knows of no moral or ethical standard anywhere against that, and there is no Mt. Vernon school policy specifically prohibiting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no re-cross, and that ended Miller’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Weston Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda Weston was an administrator in the Mt. Vernon City Schools for approximately 12 years, including Director of Teaching and Learning for around 8 years (if I heard her correctly), from 2000 to 2008, and was a teacher before that.  That Director position is basically a staff position, not a line management/administrative position.  She retired at the end of calendar 2008.  I warn you in advance: Weston is very soft-spoken and hearing her testimony was very difficult.  I’m normally seated behind and to the right of witnesses and can’t see their faces when they testify so soft-spoken witnesses are tough to report accurately.  In addition, Hamilton’s style is to jump around from topic to topic, so reconstructing a coherent thread is no fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton first asked if she expected to re-employed by the district.  She replied no.  He asked if that is by her choice.  She replied, “No it is not.”  Asked about her current employment, she said she had a contract with Houghton-Mifflin, the textbook publishers.  It wasn’t specified what the contract was for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston testified that she met twice with the HR OnCall investigators, a man and a woman.  At the second meeting Dick Cunningham, high school science department chair, and Charles Adkins, middle school science teacher were also present.  Cunningham and Adkins had done analyses of a handout that Freshwater used (“Darwin’s Theory: The Premise and the Promise” I believe is the title – it’s in my previous notes somewhere but I can’t find it at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston brought notes to the hearing that she had made to refresh her memory between the first and second meetings with the investigators in the spring of 2008.  Hamilton requested a copy – she had given a copy to David Millstone, Board attorney, sometime late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton first asked why she wasn’t called by the Board’s side as a witness.  Millstone objected, and the objection was sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she had complied fully with a subpoena from the Freshwater side for documents, and had turned over copies of her file from 2002-3 when Freshwater had proposed including what amounts to ID creationism in the science curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston testified that while she told the investigators she’d had “11 years of problems” with Freshwater, her documentation started in 2002 when he originally brought his proposal to include material critical of evolution in the science curriculum.  Prior to that time, she said, she had heard complaints from teachers in the middle school and high school, but hadn’t documented them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified there were both internal and external complaints.  She described one example in which a parent told her that Freshwater asked his class whether they believed in evolution, and when one girl raised her hand he said, “Well, we’ll see about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most complaints, though, were internal, she testified.  She named four science teachers (Elle Button, Bonnie Schutte, Dick Cunningham, and Susan White) and one administrator (Kathy Kasler) as sources of complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation she had consisted of the materials from Freshwater’s 2002-3 proposal, emails from Bonnie Schutte, and email from Dick Cunningham.  She also had a handout Elle Button had given her, passed out in Freshwater’s class when Button’s daughter Kate was in his class (see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/freshwater-day-1.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Kate Button’s testimony).  She did not recall the student questionnaires from Bonnie Schutte (see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/freshwater-hear-2.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Schutte’s testimony).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked whether Weston had spoken to then-Middle School Principal &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Koons &lt;/span&gt; Kuntz about the matter.  She testified that her conversations about the matter were with Jeff Maley, then superintendent, and that Principals did not report to her.  Asked why then the teachers came to her rather than the Principal, she replied that she was a communication link for them to the superintendent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if she believed the curriculum wasn’t being taight in Freshwater’s classroom, she replied that she believed additional material not consistent with the curriculum was being taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that Jeff Maley told her that he had met with Tim Keib, then the assistant principal of the middle school, and that Keib would be taking care of it.  She testified that Keib told Weston (and others”) that “he came from the same place” as Freshwater religiously and could make it clear to Freshwater where the boundaries are.  (Keib, it was &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/freshwater-day-8.html" rel=""&gt;testified earlier&lt;/a&gt;, inscribed a poster given to another teacher, a Mr. Sanders, “Thank you for ministering to MVMS students. You’ll never know how much I needed you this year.”)  Keib, to the best of my information, is a co-religionist of Freshwater.  Keib was also Freshwater’s evaluator when Freshwater’s turn for teacher evaluation rolled around in the last two or three years, I think in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked why she thought Keib’s intervention was unsuccessful, Weston cited a handout subsequently used by Freshwater, given her by Elle Button from her daughter Kate, which ended with a question that “implied a creator or something like that.”  (The question was actually “Was an ID involved?”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently there was a meeting with Freshwater, Maley, Cunningham, Adkins, and Weston in which Freshwater was issued firm instructions to cease.  Later in cross examination she was more specific, after having Maley’s letter to Freshwater following the meeting offered in evidence.  She said that Freshwater was instructed not to teach ID (e.g., the handouts); was questioned about the source(s) and couldn’t provide any and was told not to use unsourced material; the Board’s 2003 decision of Freshwater’s proposal was reiterated; and Freshwater was instructed that he should stick to the curriculum and standards.  This was the letter to which Freshwater responded with a letter and lesson plan in which the terms “irreducible complexity,” “specified complexity,” and “peppered moths” were used (see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-day-10.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston testified that Freshwater was unwilling to talk with other science teachers about science “because he was so set in his conception of science.”  She testified that the District offered a voluntary professional development workshop for teachers in the fall of 2003, after Freshwater’s proposal was rejected by the Board of Education, but Freshwater didn’t attend it.  (I don’t know if Lori Miller attended it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston testified that Freshwater has “ways of being underhanded.”  Asked what that means, she pointed to his use of handouts contrary to the curriculum and having students turn them in at the end of class, and to his critique of the textbook when it doesn’t correspond to his “philosophy.”  She said “If you have a great deal of influence with students and you teach material contrary to the curriculum you can harm students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the photos of the burned arm taken by Zachary Dennis’ mother, Weston testified that she would have investigated by interviewing the parents and teacher, and may have called Children’s Services.  However, she testified that Superintendent Short told her the Dennis’ didn’t want it reported, and she agreed with that judgment.  Pressed hard on why the injury wasn’t reported, she finally conceded it should have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if a letter from Elle Button (Kate’s mother and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teacher) was her only documentation of complaints about Freshwater, Weston replied there was other documentation in the file that had been turned over under subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked again what did she do about the complaints, she repeated that she talked with Maley as her reporting route.  Asked what happened, she testified that Maley told her he had a conversation with Principal &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Koons&lt;/span&gt; Kuntz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston was asked about email received from outside the community during the 2003 consideration of Freshwater’s proposal to the Board.  She said there was a great deal of it.  Under questioning she described one email from a teacher elsewhere that she passed on to Dick Cunningham, who answered it, saying that Freshwater was not required to teach just one interpretation of evolutionary processes, provided they have a basis in science.”  (That’s a pretty close quotation.)  In response, the emailer, a Mr. Donaldson (I think), responded that the email campaign was organized by a church.  She also mentioned that a “threatening letter” was received at that time from Don Matolyak, Freshwater’s pastor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Cunningham and Adkins had referred to the National Science Teachers Association’s statement on the teaching of evolution in connection with their evalution of Freshwater’s handout, there was a long series of questions about whether there was any conflict between that statement and the State standards, whether the Board had officially adopted the NSTA statement, and so on.  Mainly this line of questioning established for me that Hamilton is trying make out that his client is an unprofessional and ignorant science teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston testified that before the State standards were adopted, the guidelines of national organizations were used as the basis for local curricula, and that the state standards more or less embodied those guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing a memo from her to the HR OnCall investigators which identified a series of pages in the Academic Content Standards for their attention, we heard a loooong series of questions on whether by directing their attention to those specific pages she meant to exclude a standard on ‘bias’ in scientific research that wasn’t specifically named in her memo.  In the aggregate, her testimony in response to the series of questions was to the effect that she wasn’t excluding anything but was identifying some areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked where she heard about Freshwater’s students’ use of “here” to identify subjects where Freshwater thought the text was in error, she couldn’t remember specifically but thought perhaps Debra Strouse was the source.  (Strouse’s testimony is &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/freshwater-day-7.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an inconclusive series of questions about Weston’s characterization of Freshwater’s church as “fundamentalist.”  I saw no content here, just pecking away at the witness over semantic nitpicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weston was asked if training was provided for teachers on the Establishment Clause,on the Board’s policies on religion in the classroom and controversial issues, or on Board policies in general, and she replied in the negative to all.  (Recall that she earlier testified that the board had provided one such workshop in 2003.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to an evaluation of Freshwater by Principal &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Koons&lt;/span&gt; Kuntz in January 2003, Hamilton noted that it included the phrase “Continue to adhere to policy concerning religion in the classroom.”  He asked Weston if that indicated there was a deficiency in that respect, and she said there had been.  Hamilton then noted that the same phrase – “Continue to …” – was used several times with respect to different things, and asked if there deficiencies there as well.  She replied that the religion deficiency was established by the prior events that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton then read from an evaluation of Weston’s job performance evaluation, noting that it also used the “Continue to …” phrase, but included a qualifier indicating what specifically she should focus on to improve performance.  Freshwater’s evaluation didn’t have such a qualifier.  Weston pointed out that Freshwater’s evaluation had the Board’s policy on religion in the classroom attached to it, indicating the area that needed attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then wandered into a deep thicket of questions regarding whether it was permissible to teach “beyond the standards.”  It netted out that yes, they could, but they have to be consistent with the curriculum, and that teachers have broad latitude in using supplementary materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One line of questioning dealt with Andrew Thompson, another plainly religious teacher who spoke publicly to the same Board of Education meeting at which Lori Miller spoke.  Weston, growing emotional, agreed that she had spoken to Thompson after the meeting.  She said she’s known him since he was in third grade, wanted him to continue teaching (he was questioning then whether he could), and told him he was courageous to speak publicly.  Asked if she had said that teachers should have obtained permission to speak publicly before the Board, she denied it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she knew that Kathy Kasler, the high school principal, had requested that her daughter not be in Freshwater’s class, she replied that she did.  Asked if other parents had made the same request she replied that she didn’t know since those requests did not come to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if Freshwater’s proposal in 2003 was to “critically analyze evolution.”  She replied it was to teach intelligent design.  Asked if the actual words of the proposal were “critically analyze evolution,” she agreed.  Asked if the only reference to intelligent design was some resource materials Freshwater offered, she agreed. (One nice bit of material Freshwater brought to the Board meeting in 2003 was Jonathan Wells’ “Ten questions to ask your biology teacher about evolution.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she would agree now that meant that he wasn’t intending to teach ID, she replied that she believed he did intend to teach ID.  Asked if Freshwater had claimed there was no religious content, only ID, she replied yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Weston Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Millstone, the Board’s attorney, first questioned Weston about the age appropriate construction of the curriculum, with the material and approaches scaled to the students’ level of intellectual development at various ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then moved to the letter from Jeff Maley to Freshwater after the meeting involving Freshwater, Weston, Cunningham, Adkins, and Maley, and Freshwater’s letter in response enclosing his lesson plan, which included the mentions of “irreducible complexity”, etc. along with the state benchmarks the various days’ lessons were supposed to address.  I wasn’t able to check what standards were actually referenced, but there are no 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade state science standards that are addressed by irreducible complexity or specified complexity.  They’re purely intelligent design concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Weston Redirect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On redirect Hamilton asked the source for her statement that “critical analysis of evolution” was a code phrase for “ID.”  She replied that is what science teachers told her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’ve tried to construct a reasonably coherent narrative from the scattered questions and answers.  One problem is that Weston is an ex-teacher and, like most of the other teachers who have testified, she wanted to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; things rather than just answer the questions.  As a result, damn near every answer generated multiple rabbit trails to run down, and Hamilton apparently can’t resist a rabbit trail.  So the testimony was long, disjointed, often aimless, and very hard to report coherently.  I took 22 pages of mostly single-spaced notes on her testimony and still missed some stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 17, Jeff Cline Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Cline is a local businessman and has been publicly associated with “Coach” David Daubenmire’s Minutemen United (whose web site seems to be defunct).  Recall that Daubenmire was Freshwater’s &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; spokesman early in this affair, though more recently he has been pushed to the sidelines as Freshwater acquired a new set of advisers listed &lt;a href="http://www.bibleonthedesk.com/communitycouncil.php" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cline testified that he has been a frequent speaker at Fellowship of Christian Athletes meetings at the Mt. Vernon high school and middle school and at the neighboring East Knox schools.  In his testimony he said that he has attended approximately 100 FCA meetings in the last 4 to 6 years, and has spoken at perhaps 20 meetings in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton introduced an affidavit from Cline, though I’ve not yet read it.  The questioning centered on that affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cline testified that &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Zach Dennis called him to arrange that he speak at FCA, and that&lt;/span&gt; Freshwater has not called him to arrange for him to speak.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Added in edit 1300 EDT, 4/1&lt;/strong&gt;: I made a mistake above.  There is apparently an FCA Speaker Request form purportedly signed by Zach to indicate that he called Cline but which he denies filling out and which is claimed to not be in his handwriting.  Rechecking my raw notes, I see I have “Form says Zach called, Cline says he didn’t call.”  In writing my summary I conflated the form and Cline to produce the error.  Two other people who were at the hearing also say that Cline said “No” when asked if Zach called him to arrange for him to speak at FCA.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cline testified that he prays at FCA meetings, but that Freshwater has not done so in his presence.  Asked if he has prayed with Freshwater, Cline said he has, but not at FCA meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to a rally in support of Freshwater on the public square in Mt. Vernon on April 16, 2008, Cline testified that he helped organize it to raise a “public outcry for my Christian brother,” and that he made arrangements for the media (several TV stations) to be present, not Freshwater.  He testified that Freshwater was not aware that the media would be present at the rally.  He testified that he didn’t think Freshwater would have attended the rally had he known the media were going to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cline testified that Freshwater was fearful that “they” were going to take his Bible from his desk, and that Freshwater looked “terrible” at the rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if Freshwater wrote the statement that he gave at the rally, Cline didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked Cline why Freshwater carries a paperback Bible with him.  Cline replied that Freshwater is a very devout Christian, and that he shared it with other people.  “That’s his whole life,” Cline said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Cline Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked who Cline talked with about FCA outside of meetings.  Cline identified pastors, youth pastors, and coaches.  Asked what they talked about, he said things like the turnout, the response of kids, and so on.  Asked if they talked about the content of their talks at FCA, Cline said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked how speakers were scheduled at the middle school FCA meetings, Cline replied that students called them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if Freshwater had indicated to Cline that he (Freshwater) had written the statement he gave at the April 16 rally, Cline didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no redirect.  The hearing was adjourned for the day because of the unavailability of further witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next hearing dates are April 2 and 3.  There are apparently no dates in May on which everyone concerned can meet at the same time, and the lawyers are now juggling June dates.  We are going to be in that room until the snow flies next winter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apropos&lt;/em&gt; of that, the Mt. Vernon News had a print editorial this past Monday excoriating the hearing referee for permitting the wide-ranging and often nit-picky and rabbit-chasing (my gloss) questioning by Hamilton, thereby contributing to the length and cost of the hearing.  I say “by Hamilton” because all three examples used by the editorial were from Hamilton’s questioning.  Unfortunately the editorial is not online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty good indicator of the mood of a fair number of people in the community–the News’ editorial page tends to be a follower, not a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with respect to materials available for briefing teachers on the relevant law, a &lt;a href="http://www.secularcafe.org/showthread.php?p=17471&amp;amp;#post17471" rel="external "&gt;poster on Secular Cafe&lt;/a&gt; called my attention to two documents, one from the U.S. Department of Education &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/Speeches/08-1995/religion.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the other endorsed by a broad range of organizations, secular and religious, &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/16146leg19950412.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  ‘Course, that one is signed by the ACLU (along with a number of religious organizations, I might add), which makes many folks around here deeply suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I applaud their efforts, I just think it’s kinda sad any time you see a group of people clinging to a club that not only doesn’t want them as members but is actively working against their interests. Gay Christian is like Black Klansman. It’s just probably not the best identity to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to get into some personal stuff: What’s his relationship with his mom? How does he feel about children? Does he have a relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You sitting up there talking to a dude and he tells you he’s an atheist, you need to pack it up and go home. You talking to a person who don’t believe in God… what’s his moral barometer? Where’s it at? It’s nowhere. You gotta get into this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fucktard! He is actually saying that 15% of America has no morals at all. What’s amazing to me is that this kind of blatant bigotry is so acceptable in our society. Stating that a whole group of people has no morals is, by my standards, a far greater insult than if someone had called him a nigger or called a gay man a faggot. This ignorant fool has no understanding of human psychology at all and yet presumes to call himself a “relationship experts.” What a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in unvaccinated children appears to be driven by affluent parents choosing not to immunize. Many do so because they fear the shots could trigger autism, a concern &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476"&gt;widely discredited in medical research.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with autism rates rising, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/vaccines.html"&gt;some parents find that fear&lt;/a&gt; more worrisome than the chance that their child could contract &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/child-vpd.htm"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; that, while now very rare in this country, &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm"&gt;can still be deadly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a 7-year-old boy triggered a &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm57e222a1.htm"&gt;measles outbreak in San Diego&lt;/a&gt; after he returned, infected, from a family trip to Switzerland. His parents had chosen not to vaccinate him or his siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more children we have in our communities that are not immunized, the more likely we are going to have massive outbreaks,” said Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the &lt;a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/Pages/MeandMyFamily.aspx"&gt;California Department of Public Health’s&lt;/a&gt; Center for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, more than 10,000 kindergartners started school last fall with vaccine exemptions, up from about 8,300 the previous school year. In 1997, when enrollment was higher, the number of exempted kindergartners was 4,318.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/vaccinedenial.html"&gt;Many children have already been greatly harmed because of such negligence&lt;/a&gt;. The timing of this news is just perfect considering &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/beware_a_wave_of_stupid_is_about_to_fall.php"&gt;Jenny McCarthy is releasing a new book and is about to pop up on every credulous TV show willing to have her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melbourne’s Catholic Church has embraced a Vatican suggestion to test potential priests for sexual orientation. Those who “appear” gay will be banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the Vatican committee that made the recommendations has made it clear celibate gays should also be banned because homosexuality is ”a type of deviation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the test will be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/catholic-church-to-screen-out-the-gays/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g-DkoGvcEBw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it doesn’t seem to matter that boys and girls are being raped by priests in equal number, and that being gay is no more a criteria for determining pedophilia than whether or not you happen to be bald.&lt;/p&gt;

Like Randy Olson, Nisbet is constantly insisting that in order to challenge creationism, science must deceptiv–err, I mean “frame” its arguments to ensure not to  alienate or offend anyone, not like those contempable “New Atheists” like Richard Dawkins who has the audacity to criticize the irrational and unscientific positions of religion without first consulting with a focus group or kissing anyone’s ass. Yet according to him, while Dawkins is too “angry”, the fictional Dr. House meets with his approval. Ya got me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nisbet is a very controversial figure among the atheist and skeptical communities because he preaches for a watered down approach to challenging religion that seems to involve not telling the religious they’re wrong when they are in fact wrong and instead telling them simply that science and religion are compatible regardless of what is true just because it doesn’t offend anyone. Well now &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/03/praise-lord-for-matt-nisbet.html"&gt;Russel Blackford has written an ironic blog that “praises” Nisbet for his science by focus group position&lt;/a&gt;. Nisbet has himself responded on the comments section of that blog and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/russell-blackford-goes-after-faithscience-compatibility/"&gt;Jerry Coyne’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. Blackford has already written a comment response to Nisbet’s that is definitely worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acclaimed satirist revealed on his personal website that he had finished the project, which is out this autumn, and which his UK publisher is predicting will “provoke the religious right”. Four years in the making, Crumb worked from the King James Bible and Robert Alter’s translation to reinterpret the Book of Genesis, from the Creation via Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to Noah boarding his ark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that provokes the religious right has got to be good. Here’s how the publisher described it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to his publisher, Jonathan Cape, Robert Crumb’s Book of Genesis is a “scandalous satire” which “presents a complex, even subversive, narrative that calls for a significant re-examination of both the Bible’s content and its role in our culture”. It will be published simultaneously in the US and the UK on 19 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s called &lt;a href="http://www.bumptechnologies.com/index.phtml"&gt;“Bump”&lt;/a&gt;, and is a way to transfer contact information effortlessly. You literally bump your iPhone with someone else’s iPhone (or iPod touch), and your contact information is swapped. The phones don’t talk to each other directly. An accelerometer in each phone responds to the bump and contacts a central server, which matches everything up. Pretty clever. Here’s a video:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it’s catching on. The Chicago Tribune even wrote an &lt;a href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/eric2_0/2009/03/new-iphone-app-works-by-bump-not-touch.html"&gt;article about it&lt;/a&gt;. And, in what must be the height of fame for an iPhone application, David Pogue of the NYTimes has &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Pogue/status/1420313863"&gt;twittered it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone or iPod Touch, &lt;a href="http://www.bumptechnologies.com/index.phtml"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is really new and important is that there are all sorts of article-level metrics on each paper. The same goes for all the other TOPAZ-based PLoS journals (i.e., all but PLoS Biology - you may have noticed that PLoS Medicine has migrated onto TOPAZ as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/460" title=""&gt;Mark Patterson&lt;/a&gt; explains what and why. &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/31/newly-launched-features-on-our-online-platform/" title=""&gt;Pete Binfield&lt;/a&gt; gives you a new house tour. And &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/459" title=""&gt;Richard Cave&lt;/a&gt; gives the information for those interested in the technical side of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please take a look and give us feedback at any of those three links above, or &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/04c7e283-9e7d-4177-a657-0e8c04bf112e/Newly-launched-functionality-on-PLoS/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/ae6eb912-57c7-4278-85e6-4db3630bdc02/Check-out-exciting-PLoS-articles-upgrades-http/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=4&amp;amp;day=1&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;26 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, you should &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/357" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/254" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/261" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  Due to the upgrade, trackbacks are temporarily invisible. But send them anyway - the system is saving them and will make them visible soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005024" title=""&gt;Ants Can Learn to Forage on One-Way Trails&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trails formed by many ant species between nest and food source are two-way roads on which outgoing and returning workers meet and touch each other all along. The way to get back home, after grasping a food load, is to take the same route on which they have arrived from the nest. In many species such trails are chemically marked by pheromones providing orientation cues for the ants to find their way. Other species rely on their vision and use landmarks as cues. We have developed a method to stop foraging ants from shuttling on two-way trails. The only way to forage is to take two separate roads, as they cannot go back on their steps after arriving at the food or at the nest. The condition qualifies as a problem because all their orientation cues - chemical, visual or any other - are disrupted, as all of them cannot but lead the ants back to the route on which they arrived. We have found that workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa can solve the problem. They could not only find the alternative way, but also used the unidirectional traffic system to forage effectively. We suggest that their ability is an evolutionary consequence of the need to deal with environmental irregularities that cannot be negotiated by means of excessively stereotyped behavior, and that it is but an example of a widespread phenomenon. We also suggest that our method can be adapted to other species, invertebrate and vertebrate, in the study of orientation, memory, perception, learning and communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005104" title=""&gt;Local Individual Preferences for Nest Materials in a Passerine Bird&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Variation in the behavioural repertoire of animals is acquired by learning in a range of animal species. In nest-building birds, the assemblage of nest materials in an appropriate structure is often typical of a bird genus or species. Yet plasticity in the selection of nest materials may be beneficial because the nature and abundance of nest materials vary across habitats. Such plasticity can be learned, either individually or socially. In Corsican populations of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females regularly add in their nests fragments of several species of aromatic plants during the whole breeding period. The selected plants represent a small fraction of the species present in the environment and have positive effects on nestlings. We investigated spatiotemporal variations of this behaviour to test whether the aromatic plant species composition in nests depends on 1) plant availability in territories, 2) female experience or 3) female identity. Our results indicate that territory plays a very marginal role in the aromatic plant species composition of nests. Female experience is not related to a change in nest plant composition. Actually, this composition clearly depends on female identity, i.e. results from individual preferences which, furthermore, are repeatable both within and across years. A puzzling fact is the strong difference in plant species composition of nests across distinct study plots. This study demonstrates that plant species composition of nests results from individual preferences that are homogeneous within study plots. We propose several hypotheses to interpret this pattern of spatial variation before discussing them in the light of preliminary results. As a conclusion, we cannot exclude the possibility of social transmission of individual preferences for aromatic plants. This is an exciting perspective for further work in birds, where nest construction behaviour has classically been considered as a stereotypic behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005086" title=""&gt;Cellular Communication through Light&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Information transfer is a fundamental of life. A few studies have reported that cells use photons (from an endogenous source) as information carriers. This study finds that cells can have an influence on other cells even when separated with a glass barrier, thereby disabling molecule diffusion through the cell-containing medium. As there is still very little known about the potential of photons for intercellular communication this study is designed to test for non-molecule-based triggering of two fundamental properties of life: cell division and energy uptake. The study was performed with a cellular organism, the ciliate Paramecium caudatum. Mutual exposure of cell populations occurred under conditions of darkness and separation with cuvettes (vials) allowing photon but not molecule transfer. The cell populations were separated either with glass allowing photon transmission from 340 nm to longer waves, or quartz being transmittable from 150 nm, i.e. from UV-light to longer waves. Even through glass, the cells affected cell division and energy uptake in neighboring cell populations. Depending on the cuvette material and the number of cells involved, these effects were positive or negative. Also, while paired populations with lower growth rates grew uncorrelated, growth of the better growing populations was correlated. As there were significant differences when separating the populations with glass or quartz, it is suggested that the cell populations use two (or more) frequencies for cellular information transfer, which influences at least energy uptake, cell division rate and growth correlation. Altogether the study strongly supports a cellular communication system, which is different from a molecule-receptor-based system and hints that photon-triggering is a fine tuning principle in cell chemistry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005083" title=""&gt;Skin Blood Perfusion and Oxygenation Colour Affect Perceived Human Health&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Skin blood perfusion and oxygenation depends upon cardiovascular, hormonal and circulatory health in humans and provides socio-sexual signals of underlying physiology, dominance and reproductive status in some primates. We allowed participants to manipulate colour calibrated facial photographs along empirically-measured oxygenated and deoxygenated blood colour axes both separately and simultaneously, to optimise healthy appearance. Participants increased skin blood colour, particularly oxygenated, above basal levels to optimise healthy appearance. We show, therefore, that skin blood perfusion and oxygenation influence perceived health in a way that may be important to mate choice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005048" title=""&gt;Non-Destructive Sampling of Ancient Insect DNA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A major challenge for ancient DNA (aDNA) studies on insect remains is that sampling procedures involve at least partial destruction of the specimens. A recent extraction protocol reveals the possibility of obtaining DNA from past insect remains without causing visual morphological damage. We test the applicability of this protocol on historic museum beetle specimens dating back to AD 1820 and on ancient beetle chitin remains from permafrost (permanently frozen soil) dating back more than 47,000 years. Finally, we test the possibility of obtaining ancient insect DNA directly from non-frozen sediments deposited 3280-1800 years ago - an alternative approach that also does not involve destruction of valuable material. The success of the methodological approaches are tested by PCR and sequencing of COI and 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments of 77-204 base pairs (-bp) in size using species-specific and general insect primers. The applied non-destructive DNA extraction method shows promising potential on insect museum specimens of historical age as far back as AD 1820, but less so on the ancient permafrost-preserved insect fossil remains tested, where DNA was obtained from samples up to ca. 26,000 years old. The non-frozen sediment DNA approach appears to have great potential for recording the former presence of insect taxa not normally preserved as macrofossils and opens new frontiers in research on ancient biodiversity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004993" title=""&gt;Spatio-Temporal Transmission Patterns of Black-Band Disease in a Coral Community&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transmission mechanisms of black-band disease (BBD) in coral reefs are poorly understood, although this disease is considered to be one of the most widespread and destructive coral infectious diseases. The major objective of this study was to assess transmission mechanisms of BBD in the field based on the spatio-temporal patterns of the disease. 3,175 susceptible and infected corals were mapped over an area of 10×10 m in Eilat (northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea) and the distribution of the disease was examined monthly throughout almost two full disease cycles (June 2006-December 2007). Spatial and spatio-temporal analyses were applied to infer the transmission pattern of the disease and to calculate key epidemiological parameters such as (basic reproduction number). We show that the prevalence of the disease is strongly associated with high water temperature. When water temperatures rise and disease prevalence increases, infected corals exhibit aggregated distributions on small spatial scales of up to 1.9 m. Additionally, newly-infected corals clearly appear in proximity to existing infected corals and in a few cases in direct contact with them. We also present and test a model of water-borne infection, indicating that the likelihood of a susceptible coral becoming infected is defined by its spatial location and by the relative spatial distribution of nearby infected corals found in the site. Our results provide evidence that local transmission, but not necessarily by direct contact, is likely to be an important factor in the spread of the disease over the tested spatial scale. In the absence of potential disease vectors with limited mobility (e.g., snails, fireworms) in the studied site, water-borne infection is likely to be a significant transmission mechanism of BBD. Our suggested model of water-borne transmission supports this hypothesis. The spatio-temporal analysis also points out that infected corals surviving a disease season appear to play a major role in the re-introduction of the disease to the coral community in the following season.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5308"&gt;The gravitational force law in the Solar System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: Jo Bovy (NYU), Iain Murray (Toronto), David W. Hogg (NYU, MPIA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: If the Solar System is long-lived and non-resonant (that is, if the planets are bound and have evolved independently through many orbital times), and if the system is observed at any non-special time, it is possible to infer the dynamical properties of the Solar System (such as the gravitational force or acceleration law) from a snapshot of the planet positions and velocities at a single moment in time. We consider purely radial acceleration laws of the form &lt;em&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;= -&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;-α&lt;/sup&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; is the distance from the Sun. Using only an instantaneous kinematic snapshot (valid at 2009 April 1.0) for the eight major planets and a Bayesian probabilistic inference technique, we infer 1.989&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;2.052 (95-percent confidence). Our results confirm those of Newton (1687) and contemporaries, who inferred α=2 (with no stated uncertainty) via the comparison of computed and observationally inferred orbit shapes (closed ellipses with the Sun at one focus; Kepler 1609). Generalizations of the methods used here will permit, among other things, inference of Milky-Way dynamics from Gaia-like observations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:  instead of noting that an inverse-square behavior for the force of gravity fits the data, assume that gravity obeys an inverse power law and fit for the power.  (It’s two, to within the errors.)  Of course there have been many higher-precision tests of gravity in the Solar System than this one; the new thing here is that the data are simply the positions and velocities of all the planets &lt;em&gt;at one particular moment in time&lt;/em&gt;, no direct dynamical measurements.  A little bit of Bayesian voodoo magic, and there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to know is, what makes the authors so convinced that their instantaneous kinematic snapshot is valid &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

I guess I should feel relieved from this one: Another theory about the causes of autism has been discounted, namely, that maternal bereavement in the form of stress from the loss of a loved one during pregnancy is somehow connected to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study by researchers from Denmark is published in the current issue of &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/4/1102"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, with the title of &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/4/1102"&gt;A Nationwide Study on the Risk of Autism After Prenatal Stress Exposure to Maternal Bereavement&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined the medical records of 1,492,709 children (all single births) born from 1978 to 2003 in Denmark. 37275 of these children were born to women who had a lost a close relative either during pregnancy or up to a year prior to their pregnancy. All the children were followed up to 2006. Researchers found that "maternal bereavement during the prenatal period was not associated with an increased risk of autism in the offspring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; about the study suggests the reasons for looking at maternal bereavement during pregnancy and its effect on a developing fetus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evidence has suggested that emotional trauma during or in the year prior to pregnancy may make a woman more likely to give birth to a child who will later develop autism. Although the overall cause of autism remains highly debated and largely unknown, many experts contend it is likely the result of multiple genetic and environmental causes, particularly those that occur early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that maternal stress -- stress in the mother during pregnancy -- can significantly influence the brain development of the baby while in the womb. Additional research has linked stress during pregnancy to social and emotional problems and schizophrenia, according to background information in the &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/4/1102"&gt;journal article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was fortunate not to have suffered any such bereavements while expecting Charlie. I was working the whole time, up until two weeks prior to his being born, as a Latin teacher to middle- and upper-school students at a private school in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri. My main worry (such as it was ---life was different then!) was that I didn't yet have a position at a college or university (though I also knew that not having such a position yet would mean I could focus on taking care of a soon-to-be-born baby). Jim and I had zero financial worries and, indeed, saved a great deal of money (all later spent on Charlie, and gladly).&lt;/p&gt;

With autism awareness month starting tomorrow, and today being a day to &lt;a href="http://r-word.org/"&gt;end the use of the r-word&lt;/a&gt;, here's hoping that we can keep the focus on those individuals of all ages on the spectrum who are right here, today, with a number of vary needs, which need to be addressed here, today, and for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238534363297"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6689">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb0aea3ef7f5f385</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Con Update</title><published>2009-03-31T21:16:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T21:16:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6689" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have been waiting with bated breath (and those who have no idea what I’m talking about), I have news about the upcoming &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4969"&gt;Skepchick Con&lt;/a&gt;/Skeptics Track at &lt;a href="http://www.convergence-con.org/"&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt;.

Ostensibly, it's an organisation dedicated to the public benefit, one that does not seek to make profits, and that does not have political goals. So how the heck does something like the Catholic Church qualify as a charity? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In England and Wales, all charitable organisations with an income of more than £5,000 must be registered with the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk"&gt;Charities Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a supervisory power. The core rule is that all charities must exist "for the public benefit". There exists a list of 13 purposes that a charity can subscribe to, including advancements of animal welfare, amateur sport, and environmental protection, but all these can be summed up as falling into four broad classes: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. the relief of poverty&lt;br&gt;
2. the advancement of education&lt;br&gt;
3. the advancement of religion&lt;br&gt;
4. other purposes considered beneficial to the community&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My question is: aren't some of these classes mutually exclusive? Take for instance, the relief of poverty. I don't think it's controversial to say that provision of education is one of the most powerful forces for the eradication of poverty. As a society we agree that access to education should be free and universal, because we know there is no greater tool of social mobility. So it's easy to see that 1 and 2 go hand in hand for the definition of public benefit. Where does that leave the advancement of religion, which to an undeniable degree is contrary to the advancement of education?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at those places and times where the advancement of religion is at its zenith. The destruction of the great library at Alexandria, by either Christian zealots in 391 or Muslim zealots in 642. The decline of Islamic science in the face of the orthodox Ash'ari theology around the 12th century. In 1633, Galileo tortured by the Inquisition and placed under house arrest for demonstrating that the Earth rotates the sun. In 1925, John Scopes prosecuted for teaching science in Tennessee. The creeping influence of pseudoscientific notions on evolution in the USA under a conservative Christian administration over the last eight years. In 2008, girls' schools burned to the ground &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3882980.ece"&gt;once more&lt;/a&gt; as the Taliban grows in power in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not claiming that all religion is inherently anti-science or anti-education (and of course schools of every major faith have made great contributions to science). But when those in power are able to make decisions based upon religious doctrine, society suffers. The United States' founding fathers recognised this, which is why they were so insistent on the separation of church and state. I'm in favour of the advancement of religion as a private form of spiritual pursuit, but not as a political power. Which brings us to our next point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Charities Commission states: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Charities can carry out political or campaigning activities to help achieve a charitable purpose, but a charity cannot have political aims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be an internally contradictory statement, and it's hard for me to reconcile this with the political activities and intents of a great many religious groups. Christians are a diverse group, with representatives at every end of the scale, but it's ridiculous to try and claim that some churches do not have political goals. Opposition to abortion, gay marriage, extra-marital sex, and so forth are views that each person is entitled to, but when one seeks to impose this morality on members of other faiths, or no faith at all, it's indistinguishable from politics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, the fundamentalist lobby group Christian Voice, headed by Stephen Green. It is registered with the Charities Commission as the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=294803&amp;amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0"&gt;National Council for Christian Standards in Society&lt;/a&gt;, with the stated aim of "re-establishing biblical Christian teaching throughout the nation". Ever the font of militant Christian righteousness, the organisation has built up a comprehensive reputation for intolerance, drawing criticism from secular and religious groups alike. In 2006 Green narrowly escaped prosecution for distributing homophobic leaflets at a gay festival in Cardiff. Christian Voice has also criticised a programme aiming to promote tolerance amongst children, opposes abortion, homosexuality, and safer sex education, and supports a reintroduction of the death penalty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A special form of hatred, however, seems to be reserved for women. According to its website, Christian Voice would like to see a change in the law to allow a man to rape his wife, reasoning: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the promises given by a man and woman to each other establish a binding consent to sexual intercourse&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Voice also opposed the HPV vaccine (a prophylactic against cervical cancer), claiming that the jab causes infertility. The organisation also &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/Press/press105.html"&gt;blames&lt;/a&gt; central aspects of the women's liberation - gainful employment and reproductive control - for rises in knife crime, drug use, 'illicit sex' and lawlessness. Even within the organisation, women seem to be allocated an auxiliary role:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;So if you are a Christian man who wants to get stuck in to some exciting, energetic activity and see the Lord move in power, or a woman with the 'get-up-and-go' gene who wants men to be out on the battlefield - or maybe there is something of the Deborah or the Boadicea about you - join us today...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Voice rails against politicians' failure to legislate according to biblical law, and appears to want some Christian-flavour form of sharia law to be installed in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me, it seems to be an organisation dedicated to hate speech with the stated aim of stripping back so many of the laws and customs that as a society we are proud to have achieved. For these reasons, it's very difficult for me to see how Christian Voice possibly qualifies as providing 'a public benefit' or an absence of political goals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how do we filter faith-based initiatives which promise a public benefit from bible-literalists who'd take us back to the dark ages? And why is someone allowed to operate a public-detriment organisation tax-free simply by sticking God's name on it?&lt;br&gt;

Although I knew that Jenny McCarthy was soon to release another book promoting autism quackery, I had thought it wasn't coming out for a month or two. The book is entitled &lt;em&gt;Healing and Preventing Autism: A Complete Guide&lt;/em&gt;, written by Jenny and her partner in autism quackery Dr. Jerry Kartzinel. Dr. Kartzinel, some may recall, wrote the foreword to Jenny McCarthy's very first paean to autism quackery back in 2007 and was properly lambasted by &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/10/jerry-kartzinel-and-lying-about-nature.html"&gt;Autism Diva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=682"&gt;Kevin Leitch&lt;/a&gt; for saying things like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Autism, as I see it, steals the soul from a child; then, if allowed, relentlessly sucks life's marrow out of the family members, one by one.."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, accompanying the release of Jenny's latest antivaccine screed is a rather extensive media appearance schedule, as  &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/news-press/2009Mar-press-tour.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;announced by Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;. I suggest that you get out the barf bag before you read it. The usual suspects are there, of course. Credulous, doddering enabler of the antivaccine movement, Larry King, will be having Jenny and Jim on &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/larry.king.live/"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt; this Friday night, and, depressingly, she's going to be on &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/gma"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow. Finally, if you want any more evidence than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php"&gt;what I've presented&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://www.thedoctorstv.com/"&gt;The Doctors&lt;/a&gt; is a horrible, horrible show promoting false health scares that vaccines cause autism and even autism quackery falsely "balanced" as co-equal with scientific medicine and all the studies that have failed to find even a hint of a link between vaccines and autism, look no further than the fact that on April 17 and episode of &lt;a href="http://www.thedoctorstv.com/"&gt;The Doctors&lt;/a&gt; featuring Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Kartzinel, J. B. Handley, and Stan Kurtz, and a "recovered family" will be taped for viewing later. My guess is that it'll air in May, just in time for sweeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh joy. These "Doctors" should have their medical licenses revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like it's going to be a painful spring for practitioners and supporters of science-based medicine and those of us who detest pseudoscience and quackery. Indeed, the propaganda pace is accelerating; Jenny used to release just one book a year, usually in September, but this time it's only been about six or seven months since her last book. I should have seen it coming. April is Autism Awareness month, and since I first discovered the issue I noticed that the antivaccine movement always cranks up the crazy in April. Always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it looks to me as though the antivaccine movement won't be content with its current low body count. It wants to spread its poison throughout the U.S. As it was in the U.K., it will be aided and abetted in this task by credulous media that either loves controversy or thrives on the mantra of "balance."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/beware_a_wave_of_stupid_is_about_to_fall.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/om-KTw1vT3s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238529176862"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/yeah_the_catholic_church_has_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3f0e330eaaa20cf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Yeah, the Catholic church has a real problem with gay priests.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melbourne's Catholic Church has embraced a Vatican suggestion to test potential priests for sexual orientation. Those who "appear" gay will be banned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The head of the Vatican committee that made the recommendations has made it clear celibate gays should also be banned because homosexuality is ''a type of deviation''.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to know details about how these tests are going to be done. Do they hook the candidate up to a plethysmograph and then show them pictures of varying degrees of titillation to various sexual orientations? That sounds fun — they might get a flood of new prospects who are really just there for the test. Heck, if I was sufficiently bored, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; might sign up … especially if the testing is done by hot novices in sexy wimples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, still, it's all incredibly wrong-headed. Priests are people who are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to be celibate…it should hardly matter whether they are turned on by women or men or turnips, for that matter.  There might even be a significant number of church leaders who are radical perverts deep down, but are in the priesthood specifically and sincerely for the whole denial of the flesh aspect. Why single out gays? Shouldn&amp;#39;t we be more worried about priests with uncontrollable urges towards children, or even heterosexual priests who are unable to resist the women who look up to them as authority figures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't about correcting the problems of the church at all.

&lt;p&gt;Mostly though, I see this community as home, and I want to know who’s got their feet up on my metaphorical couch.  If you had your feet up on my real couch, I’d probably do this with a never-ending parade/trivia test of movie quotes– seeing which movies we have in common is a shorthand way to see why we get along.  But since the quote I was going to lay on y’all today turns out to be easily IMDB-able*, instead I’m asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit me with your favorite movie or book quotes; or song lyrics.  What best describes your mood today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the airlines are not so friendly to people with invisible disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the AAPD article,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"American Airlines has a long history of diversity and inclusion and is proud to partner with the AAPD to establish this award in honor of all of our employees, customers and partners with disabilities," said Will Ris, American's Senior Vice President - Government Affairs and member of the AAPD's Board of Directors. "We want to acknowledge creative companies who are supporting people with disabilities and understand the business value of inclusive advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Airlines may have made some headway into supporting diversity and inclusion for some, but definitely not for all.  Airports, airlines, air travel in general has become increasingly less accessible.  The barriers start before even reaching the gate, security requires increasingly intensive social interaction, communication, and executive function skills.  Stewardesses refuse to read written communications.  Stewards refuse to allow ear plugs during take off and landing.  Passengers talk about how terrible it is to be seated next to an autistic person within the person's hearing range.   Airport assistance is denied if someone can walk, or the person is required to sit in a wheelchair in order to be assisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rettdevil blogged about &lt;a href="http://rettdevil.blogspot.com/2006/07/but-we-did-disability-training.html"&gt; (safety threatening) incompetence&lt;/a&gt; on the part of airline staff,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"but we DID disability training"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they actually said that to me, after I had a seizure after I had a meltdown because my stupid airline made me miss my flight-I suggested, via someone reading what I was typing (I am always nonverbal post seizure. ALWAYS) that perhaps their front desk people needed some training re: invisible disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.  They do.  Why haven't they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airline access is something that is in people's consciousness.  The Oregon Institute on Disability and Development &lt;a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/oidd/CSD/transprerc.cfm"&gt;partners with airlines&lt;/a&gt; on access issues, and even did a huge study and intervention on airline passenger training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited about this, I approached my contacts and the OIDD, only to find that while originally the accessible airline project was supposed to cover invisible disabilities such as autism, it ended up explicitly excluding them.  Specifically, the director of the &lt;a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~hunterzk/ncat/"&gt;National Center on Accessible Transportation (NCAT)&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Kate Hunter-Zaworski, asked the OIDD to remove from the project anything not related to physically lifting people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ZitsConnotation.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ZitsConnotation.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The idea that you can mean something "in a good way" or "in a bad way" is similar to the idea of the &lt;em&gt;connotation&lt;/em&gt; of a word or phrase: something suggested or implicated beyond its essential or primary or literal meaning.  But the connotational difference between "strong-willed" and "pig-headed", or "thrifty" and "miserly", is a more or less fixed property of the words involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning something in a good or a bad way, on the other hand, is seen as a choice that the speaker or writer can make.  The commonest case seems to be for someone to say something that would most naturally be taken as bad, adding that "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22I+mean+that+in+a+good+way%27&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cts=1238517777662"&gt;I mean that in a good way&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This addendum of course is often ironic, and perhaps especially so if presented in the superlative form "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22mean+that+in+the+best+possible+way%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;I mean that in the best possible way&lt;/a&gt;". Negative forms are fairly common as well, e.g. "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22don%27t+mean+that+in+a+good+way%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cts=1238517669619"&gt;I don't mean that in a good way&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22I+mean+that+in+the+worst+possible+way%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cts=1238517826420"&gt;I mean that in the worst possible way&lt;/a&gt;", etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a set of ways for the recipient of a message to add a perhaps-unexpected evaluation  — &amp;quot;I take that as a compliment&amp;quot;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that there's a linguistic term of art for the phenomenon of asserting that a non-obvious emotional valence is to be imposed on messages sent or received. And as a matter of historical stylistics, I wonder where and when the specific class of phrases like "I mean that in a good way" arose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238519831902"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27cbc2d56ef6aea4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communication"/><title type="html">Framing and ethics (part 3).</title><published>2009-03-31T18:07:21Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T18:07:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/9lmYR3TOYEY/framing_and_ethics_part_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a pair of earlier posts, I looked at the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_1.php"&gt;ethical principles Matthew C. Nisbet says should be guiding the framing of science&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_2.php"&gt;examples Nisbet discusses of ethical and unethical framing&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, consider some lessons we might learn from the framing wars.  I'm hopeful that we can gain insight about the folks interested in communicating science, about the various people with whom they're trying to communicate, and perhaps even about the approaches that might be useful (or counterproductive) in trying to sell scientists on the utility of the framing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not so much a response to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/2009/03/the_ethics_of_framing_science.php"&gt;Matt's recent post on the ethics of framing&lt;/a&gt; as it is to the multi-year brouhaha over framing and its discontents in the science blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons I'm taking away from all of this are more along the lines of bite-sized nuggets than a Grand Unified Moral of the Story (although it's quite possible that someone with more patience or insight than I can muster could find the grand unifying thread in these nuggets):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_3.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/framing_and_ethics_part_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/9lmYR3TOYEY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238519776751"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/signs_of_spring.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8af52a73f0cc2019</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Signs of Spring</title><published>2009-03-31T14:11:29Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T14:11:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/SdWDtsz5Qu8/signs_of_spring.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/signs_of_spring.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Signs of spring so far around where I live, apart from the obvious sunshine and disappearance of the snow &amp;amp; ice:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crocus&lt;br&gt;

Unfortunately, in response to the substantial criticisms of the idea of compatibility between faith and science, Nisbet only offers a feeble and &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; correction to a minor point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correction is in order on Blackford's post. Contrary to his framing, market research was not used to decide the position of the NAS, nor the 20 professional scientific organizations in the editorial at FASEB that endorsed the themes in the booklet. These organizations have had a long standing position on science and religion that has emphasized compatibility. The audience research indicated that emphasizing this long standing position was an effective way to communicate about evolution.

I suggest taking a look at what &lt;a href="http://www.lifescied.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/20?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;author1=Pope&amp;amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;NAS staffers wrote in an article at Life Sciences Education&lt;/a&gt; about how they used public opinion data and evidence-actually listening to their audience-before trying to communicate with them about a complex and sometimes controversial area of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most severe insult offered in this comment is the part where he accuses Blackford of framing. Is that actionable, I wonder? Did Russell weep hot wet salty tears of shame when he was lanced with that horrific rhetorical thrust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serious issue he's addressing is the National Academy of Sciences useful little booklet, &lt;i&gt;Science, Evolution, and Creationism&lt;/i&gt;. When it came out, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/mixed_messages_from_the_nas.php"&gt;I said good things about it&lt;/a&gt; — it&amp;#39;s a handy short introduction to evolution for the layman. However, it also contained a rather objectionable section that perfectly represents the problem that &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/national-academies-science-evolution.html"&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt; and I have been complaining about for years, and that &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/booksarts/story.html?id=1e3851a3-bdf7-438a-ac2a-a5e381a70472&amp;amp;k=39427&amp;amp;p=1"&gt;Jerry Coyne has recently torn into&lt;/a&gt;: it also pukes up a thick wad of partially digested, slimy religious pablum claiming that  "Science and Religion Offer Different Ways of Understanding the World".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how much &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/godless_scientists_have_an_eth.php"&gt;I detest that phrase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not true, and it&amp;#39;s also unrepresentative — there is a significant (and growing) strain of scientific thought that finds the claim objectionable. That argument is &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; omitted from the NAS booklet. As I wrote in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/mixed_messages_from_the_nas.php"&gt;my original comment&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do science and religion offer different ways of understanding the world? Sure. One is verifiable, testable, and has a demonstrated track record of success; the other is a concoction of myths that actually leads to invalid conclusions. Perhaps it ought to be rephrased: science provides one way to understand the world, while religion provides millions of ways to misunderstand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the NAS published contained an intentionally one-sided version of the state of affairs in science — it emphasized &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; the accommodationist view that religion and science are compatible, soliciting comments on the subject from the usual subjects, people like Collins and Miller and Ayala. These are good people and good scientists, but dear dog, they are a poor reflection of the attitudes of the scientific community. If the only people  these organizations ever put up as the face of science were Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, everyone would see the problem immediately…but Collins and Miller have become the reassuring tranquilizing narcotic that scientists fire into the faces of the public, to fool them into thinking that science really doesn&amp;#39;t offer any world-changing perspectives on comfortable old myths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a lie. Science &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; make you uncomfortable. It will change your ideas about the universe. It will force you to confront awkward facts and difficult consequences. It is not a balm to reinforce the status quo, and if you try to present it as if it is, you're doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Nisbet offer in his brief reply? His defense is that the NAS did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use market research to define their message. They used institutional tradition (which, I would argue, ought to be more accurately called institutional inertia, and give the strength of creationism in the US, ought to be rejected as a failure), and gives us a link that shows…the &lt;a href="http://www.lifescied.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/20?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;author1=Pope&amp;amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;NAS used market research in composing the booklet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not like you have to read between the lines to figure that out. &lt;b&gt;It says it plainly&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…this new edition was shaped to a large extent by a careful program of audience research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a section entitled "Listening to intended audiences" even. They come right out and say that whole sections were rewritten: they cut out any emphasis on the Dover decision, because, they say, "the public does not readily understand the role of the courts in such matters". They admit that they expanded the section on science and religion, and solicited statements from various religious denominations and religious scientists. And it repeats something that many people, atheists and theists alike, have been saying is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes clear that acceptance of the overwhelming and continually growing body of evidence for evolution need not be in conflict with religious beliefs for many people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It "need not"? But it is. This head-in-the-sand approach of pretending that all those fervently-held religions that make anti-evolutionism a central part of their creed is precisely the kind of befuddled and condescending obliviousness that has put us in the situation we're in right now. Face it. Reality erodes faith-based belief, and science is all about dredging up reality and rubbing your faces in it. Nothing in science supports religious beliefs, and all those acclaimed scientists who are trotted out to issue their homilies about the importance of their faith are operating in defiance of reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also argue that market research, which is all about tailoring the message to what the audience wants to hear, is antithetical to science, which should be about telling people what they &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to know, no matter how uncomfortable it makes them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/run_for_the_hills_its_the_fram.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/U3il8_sn00o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238515599114"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6821">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/267f103ae3cc4cdf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="food"/><category term="gangs"/><title type="html">KFC's Service Might Be Bad in the Restaurants, But It Knows How to Fill Potholes</title><published>2009-03-31T15:20:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T15:20:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/fHm0mtvQsaE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/kfcs-service-might-be-bad-in-the-restaurants-but-it-knows-how-to-fill-potholes/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I blogged yesterday about my theories as to why KFC seems to have bad customer service, even though the chain gives so much lip-service to customers.

&lt;p&gt;Holy &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt;. You have to read this article. Insulation from one of the solid rocket boosters fell and slammed into the orbiter’s underside, damaging (it was found later) over 700 tiles along half the length of Atlantis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Seriously, &lt;em&gt;yikes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the crew onboard did a camera check of the tiles, they found the damage and were obviously seriously concerned. They reported it to Mission Control, who looked at the video and said there was no cause for concern. Astronauts Mike Mullane and Robert Gibson knew better. In fact, they thought that re-entry might very well kill them. It didn’t, but it was a near thing. One tile was totally gone, allowing the (non-vital) metal underneath it to partially melt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never heard this story, have you? I’m not surprised. This Atlantis mission was blacked-out because it was done for the Department of Defense; the Shuttle was doing secret military work. This is a point of contention for many people, since NASA is a civilian agency, but there you go. The video the astronauts took of the orbiter’s belly had to be encrypted and somewhat low-res, so ground controllers didn’t get a good view of the damage… but they should have seen enough to raise alarms. Gibson didn’t argue with ground control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the resolution on the encrypted video was that bad that [ground control] based a conclusion on it that was in gross error. … If I had said hey, I think this is important enough for us to break the encryption and send you guys clear video, oh, it would have been pandemonium down there at DOD. But in hindsight, oh man, that’s what we should have done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988 there was no safe haven on orbit for the Shuttle, so even if the orbiter were so damaged it would be destroyed on re-entry, not much could be done about it. I would think NASA would tell the astronauts if this were the case; there might be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things that can be done to maximize the safety of the crew’s return — changing the re-entry angle to take pressure off the damaged right wing comes to mind, though it’s not clear how much that would help — and talking to the astronauts is the only way to do that. So it looks like the people on the ground really thought the damage wasn’t critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the whole world found out 15 years later, insulation hitting tiles can indeed be critical, when we lost Columbia in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is a big agency, and it has loads of innovative people, creative people, people who spend their whole lives dreaming of space exploration. But it is also a government agency, capable of incredible inertia and groupthink. I hope that the folks at NASA have learned these lessons well. In the next few years NASA may once again get the chance to have its reach exceed its grasp as it did during the magnificent Apollo era, and it would be a loss for everyone if bureaucracy and red tape were to shorten that reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238513681250"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1684062031137999803">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8cd18d8a77ed4ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="War" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">1,2,3 ...

Watch as the hilarity ensues. The Bishop's Association said:&lt;blockquote&gt;...the therapy "lacks scientific credibility" and could expose people to "malevolent forces"...for a Catholic to believe in reiki presents "insurmountable problems".&lt;/blockquote&gt;I may die.  Hearing a Catholic bishop say something is not feasible because it "lacks scientific credibility" is amazing.  &lt;i&gt;"Yeah, that reiki shit?  Not a way in H-E-double hockey sticks, fella.  But virgin birth and dude flying into the sky, I'm all over that."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and then there's this:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Catholic who puts his or her trust in reiki would be operating in the realm of superstition, the no man's land that is neither faith nor science. Superstition corrupts one's worship of God by turning one's religious feeling and practice in a false direction."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh man, I'm seriously going to have a fuckin' aneurysm if these dudes keep it up.  "Operating in the realm of superstition"?!  Was that a joke?  That's a joke, right?  Oh man, that's rich....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and if you were wondering about the mindset of the reiki practitioners and the "evidence" they present, "Reiki master Judith White" said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Reiki balances energy in the same way as acupuncture or reflexology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I can write no more.  I have a pain in my chest, like an elephant sitting on it.  My left arm tingles.  My jaw hurts.  I must go.

It turns out that the antivaccine movement is succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right, a cadre of upper middle class, scientifically illiterate parents, either full of the arrogance of ignorance or frightened by leaders of the antivaccine movement, such as J.B. Handley, Barbara Loe Fisher, Jenny McCarthy, or the rest of the crew at the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism, are succeeding in endangering your children. Although the U.K. got a head start in bringing back the measles and mumps, thanks to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;Andrew Wakefield's falsified research&lt;/a&gt; bought and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;paid for by trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; suing vaccine manufacturers back in 1998, which sparked a scare over the MMR vaccine that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;has not yet abated&lt;/a&gt;. Here in the U.S., reinvigorated by the obnoxiously bubble-brained &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;purveyor of "Indigo" woo&lt;/a&gt;, who since her child Evan was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, has become the face of the antivaccine proquackery propaganda group Generation Rescue, the antivaccine movement has managed to become better funded and more visible than ever, so much so that the U.S. could well be at the verge of going where the U.K. has already gone, into the territory of endemic vaccine-preventable illnesses once previously thought eradicated, such as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=430"&gt;Hib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_jenny_mccarthy.php"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to what antivaccine advocates claim, these are not benign diseases, and they are preventable by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's only a matter of time before large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease occur, and when they occur, most likely they will &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immunization29-2009mar29,0,3148179.story"&gt;start in California&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_the_outbreaks_begin_theyll_start_in.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_the_outbreaks_begin_theyll_start_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_zaDAfEq4Gg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238505551965"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6704">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d464e24305cb43a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 3.31</title><published>2009-03-31T12:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T12:45:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6704" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Its 3-year orbit around the Sun is a little odd: it’s elliptical, going out as far as the main asteroid belt, but then dipping back in to get only 19 million kilometers or so from the Earth’s orbit. This makes it a Near Earth Object, or NEO, though not really a dangerous one. It belongs to a class of asteroids called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_asteroid"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which have similar orbits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=1996%20HW1;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/1996hw1_orbit.jpg" alt="Orbit of NEO 1996 HW1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The orbit of 1996 HW1 is in blue. In September 2008 it dove near the Earth in its&lt;br&gt; elliptical orbit, passing about 20 million km away. Click to get lots more info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it look like? What shape is it? It’s too small to be resolved even by big telescopes, so you might think we can’t determine its shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but we’re clever, we evolved monkeys. Turns out, we don’t have to see it all that well to figure out its shape. I present to you the shape of NEO 1996 HW1, as determined by &lt;a href="http://tmoa.jpl.nasa.gov/hw1.htm"&gt;the good folks at the Table Mountain Observatory&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


				&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How. Freaking. Awesome. Is. &lt;em&gt;That?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another view on that link, looking &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; on it so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did they get the shape of this thing? Between July 2008 and January 2009, Michael Hicks, Heath Rhoades, and James Somers observed the asteroid over many occasions. As 1996 HW1 moves around the Sun, the amount of sunlit surface we see changes (just like the Moon goes through phases). If it were a perfect sphere, then we can predict exactly how much light we would see from it as our angle to it changes. But then, we could do that if it were, say, a cube, too! Or a banana-shape, or an axisymmetric epicycloid (a figure-8 shape that has loomed large in my life; remind me to tell you that story someday). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s possible, given enough observations, to determine the rough shape of any object from measuring how its brightness changes over time. This method is called &lt;em&gt;light curve inversion&lt;/em&gt;. A light curve is the plot of brightness over time. You feed those numbers into some pretty fierce equations which determine the shape of the object. Since normally you use the shape to get the light curve, this method is the &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; of that. That’s where the name comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this method works, because it’s been used to predict the shapes of asteroids which were later found to be accurate &lt;a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;amp;cpsidt=18214743"&gt;when high-resolution images of asteroids were obtained&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science! I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this stuff. Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the animation you can see that HW1 is elongated. I also noticed that the rotation period (mentioned in the Table Mountain page) is long for a small asteroid, about 9 hours. Most small asteroids spin faster than that, which is interesting. Why so slow? I suspect it’s suffering from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/14/the-shape-of-rocks-to-come/"&gt;the YORP effect&lt;/a&gt;, where sunlight can slow the spin of an asteroid. This is strongest in asymmetric rocks, and HW1 is clearly not terribly symmetric, so this may indeed be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of shape fitting is incredibly powerful. We can learn a lot from just a few observations, and of course the more data we get, and the more accurate they are, the better a fit we can get to an asteroid’s shape, and the more we can learn about them. And need I remind you, these rocks are not all safe. Some of them have orbits which do cross ours, and one the size of HW1 is big enough to cause a mass extinction. So hear me well when I say that the more we know about these asteroids, the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this can be learned without ever leaving the comfy confines of our little blue planet! So when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; venture out to visit these interplanetary rogues, we’ll have a much better idea of what they’re about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the shape of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

Applications range from the very small to the huge. The electric car industry is essentially waiting on improvements in battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Z. L. Wang from the Georgia Institute for Technology &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/326/2"&gt;has recently announced&lt;/a&gt; a breakthrough at the other end of the size spectrum - the very tiny. He has created, not a battery, but a nanoscale energy generator that uses the piezoelectric effect to convert movement into electrical current. The effects are still modest - 0.2 volts with an efficiency of 6.8%, but this is enough for some applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piezoelectric effect is a property of some materials that converts mechanical energy into electrical current. Our bones have this property and it is that which causes the molding of bones under pressure (such as moving the placement of teeth in the jaw using braces).  The amount of current generated is generally small - we won’ be running our cars off the piezoelectric effect, but in the aggregate can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Wang has done is create rods with nanoscale zinc oxide bristles. When jostled the bristles move against each other, bending them and generating current through the peizoelectric effect. The innovation here is the extremely small size. While the current generated is still small, if enough of these microdynamos were put together they could be useful for some applications. But most applications will have to wait until improvements are made and higher efficiencies are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially such nanoscale piezoelectric devices could be used to research all of the small electronic devices that we carry around with use - cell phones, mp3 players, beepers, watches, cameras, etc. Just from walking around we generate and waste a great deal of mechanical energy. Some of that energy can be recaptured and put to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exciting potential application is in implantable medical devices. One major technical limitation of such devices is that they need energy, but once inside the body it’s hard to replace the batteries. Some devices, like even the best current artificial hearts, require external batteries. Others, like pacemakers, can be charged from the outside using a coil or need to be removed to have their batteries changed every 7-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if such devices could be charged by the movement of the body itself - by biological energy. Pacemakers, for example, could be charged by the energy of the beating heart. (Such systems are &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1084658/Pacemaker-recharged-heart-developed-scientists.html"&gt;already in development &lt;/a&gt;using microgenerators.) The constant expansion and contraction of the chest and diaphragm for breathing is another source of mechanical energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, walking can be a significant source of mechanical energy. Every time our feet strike the ground the impact dissipated mechanical energy throughout our shoes, feet, legs, and hips. Every step could be used to harvest some of that energy. Swinging arms could also be exploited for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - deliberate activity could be employed. If your cell phone is running a bit low, just shake it for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological activity is not the only source of ambient mechanical energy. Our world is full ove movement and much of the energy of that movement is dissipated uselessly to the environment. For example, the energy of rain striking the ground is completely wasted.  If, however, it struck a piezoelectric plate the energy of the falling droplets could be harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is the ultimate currency of our civilization. As we search for greater efficiency of energy production and use the ability to extract ambient energy from the environment will be extremely useful. The piezoelectric effect allows us to connect mechanical energy to electricity, and this property can be exploited in numerous ways, limited only by our cleverness. This is definitely a technology to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4221.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:6px" title="img_4221" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4221-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="348"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had the pleasure of seeing &lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com/"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; last night, in his new show, “Ready for this?”. We had second row seats, which meant we almost got hit by a flying fan when he kicked it off stage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim burst onto the stage with a song about “who needs a band anyway?” then jumped straight onto the grand piano, for a 2 hour show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights included a song he described as being about prejudice, the chorus containing the letters, N, E, G, R, G, I, recited. After about 3 choruses, he revealed the word as “Ginger” much to the great amusement of the audience. This of course turned in Ginga, then Ranga and every other incarnation of red-headed people. The chorus melded into; “only a ginga can call another ginga a ginga”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered throughout the performance were references to science and scepticism. Of course, Tim is well known for his sceptical outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the guest performance for “&lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com/bear-dance/"&gt;Bears don’t dig on dancing&lt;/a&gt;” by a competition winner, he asked the pharmacy worker what was his favourite non-evidence based product was. But before the kid dressed in a full body beat suit had a chance to answer, Tim fired back; “That was a big pause (paws)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight for me was definitely the 9 minute beat poem, “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujUQn0HhGEk&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;” a tale of a North London dinner pary where Tim meets a hippie who dismisses science for all things woo. Sitting next to Richard, I almost burst during this number. Pure brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to catch Tim on the remainder of his &lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com/gigs/"&gt;Australian tour&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238492529494"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-4114374073829480941">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f22c25fd6d6188f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rants" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Symbols</title><published>2009-03-31T05:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T05:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/03/symbols.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">I'm sick of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, let me back up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not sick of symbols in general, or the concept of symbols, or the way that certain things can be represented with one culturally meaningful item, i.e. the Superman "S" shield standing for truth and justice, or a cross acting as a symbol of the Christian faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I'm becoming increasingly sick of is symbols being treated as the thing they symbolize, and actions being taken against the symbols that are then assumed to effect the things they symbolize in some substantive manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explicitly, what I'm sick of is the media and the American public attaching ire and outrage to irrelevant symbols of corporate decadence and focusing the entirety of their attention on those symbols rather than the actual underlying problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bear in mind this isn't the same as, say, flag-burning, where disdain for the symbol is meant to be interpreted as disdain for the object for which the symbol stands. Flag-burners know that they aren't actually fixing the problems they have with America by burning a flag. The flag-burning is itself a symbolic act; it symbolizes political unrest and issues with the American government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, what I'm talking about is someone who burns a flag and then goes home happy because his pyromania was a direct assault on the establishment itself and now that the flag is in ashes on the ground, the problem has been solved. The symbol becomes the thing symbolized, and all outrage is directed at the symbol rather than the thing itself, and all emotionally-satisfying damage to the symbol is seen as actual damage to the thing itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The earliest major instance of this came, I think, last year when the CEOs of the Big Three auto companies flew to DC, hats in hand, to ask for some cash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was an early opponent to any kind of auto bailout; these companies had sewn the seeds of their own collapse years, even decades ago, so let them fail, I thought. But the implications of such a failure would be extremely wide-ranging, and we're not just talking about people out of work directly and indirectly. Losing the auto industry would rob America of one of its final major means of actual economic production. Sure, Wal-Mart employs a lot of people, but when everyone works in the service industry, your economy is in a sad shape indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, as I learned more about the actual internal structure of GM (the one in the biggest trouble) as opposed to the pop-culture version of decadence, low-quality vehicles, and no plans to change, it seemed to me that the public outrage was motivated more by inaccuracies in reporting and common consciousness than anything, and that people were angry with these smaller, less ineffable entities because they simply didn't understand Wall Street at all. The automakers were a problem they could grasp, and grasp it they did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the three CEOs flew to Washington, and all hell broke loose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They flew &lt;i&gt;private jets!&lt;/i&gt; They stayed at &lt;i&gt;nice hotels!&lt;/i&gt; They ate &lt;i&gt;expensive dinners!&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, I was annoyed, too; I fed into the cultural consciousness as much as anyone, and such oversights did seem symbolic of the problems the companies were facing. But then, after a time, I realized that &lt;i&gt;symbolic&lt;/i&gt; is all they were. Companies asking for tens of billions of dollars will not stand or fall on the cost of jet fuel, or the difference between a Howard Johnson and the Ritz-Carlton. It would take 50,000 jet flights at $20,000 apiece to equal even &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the billions they were asking for. Clearly this kind of "decadence" was not the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nobody would let it go! Perhaps it was the impassioned speech by the congressman interrogating them that called out these minor foibles. Certainly that was part of it. More than anything, though, I think the problem is that an ignorant public latched onto something they could understand rather than dig deeper to look at the real underlying issues. It's an easy shortcut to think that these sorts of things are the problem instead of a comparatively irrelevant PR failure (especially when you have almost no grasp of basic mathematics, like most of the US public).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it definitely was a PR failure. I won't argue with that. They &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; bad. They &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; like a panhandler begging for change while wearing a brand-new pair of Jordans (one of my big-city pet peeves). Why give him a buck or two when he can obviously afford expensive shoes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they only looked like that because people couldn't (or just plain didn't) appreciate the sheer scale of the money in play. A panhandler in Jordans only requires you to deal with a simple amount of money. Most people have had a couple hundred bucks at some point or another; you could hold that much in your hand easily. A discrepancy between the expense of the shoes and the claimed poverty is thus easy and natural to draw. We &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that someone with no money couldn't afford Jordans, and the difference is on a small-enough scale that we can grasp it without much thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the difference between ten billion dollars and a couple extra thousand spent on a trip to Washington is so much bigger that it's hardly on the same scale. Two slightly more apt analogies: (1)They're much more like a bum asking for change while sitting in his Lamborghini, but even that doesn't quite adequately demonstrate the scale. (2)Refusing to give them the money because they flew in on their private jets is like not giving a bum some change because he already has a slice of processed American cheese. Such decadence! Why should I be charitable to &lt;i&gt;him?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know what? Screw that. It's more like not giving the bum some change because he is in possession of a baker's dozen gold atoms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But people are stupid and don't get math, and the media doesn't help by manufacturing outrage at PR failures that are nothing more than &lt;i&gt;symbols&lt;/i&gt; at which to be outraged. The jet flights were &lt;i&gt;symbols&lt;/i&gt; of the Big Three's perceived financial irresponsibility, &lt;i&gt;symbols&lt;/i&gt; of the reasons people didn't want them to get money. They weren't the thing itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which would be fine, if people acknowledged that they were just symbols, just PR failures, but then harped on the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; issues with the companies. But people never did. They wanted to see the mighty brought low for irrelevant offenses; they pretended that these symbols were the thing itself, and thus punishable offenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CEOs won't work for a penny a year? &lt;i&gt;Burn them down and dance on the ashes!&lt;/i&gt; The vast relative values of their salaries and their companies' financial needs be damned!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's kind of like shooting the messenger, except that when someone shoots the messenger, they don't tend to then think that the problem referenced in the message has been solved. If the Godfather gets a message that his son has been kidnapped by a rival family, he doesn't shoot the messenger and then pretend that his son is home. He shoots the messenger and then goes and shoots everyone involved with his son's kidnapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's the kind of redirection that America has been dealing with on a near-constant basis since the economy fell last fall. First it was jet-setting automaker CEOs. That one lasted a while; people picked away at trivial issues with the Big Three as if they actually had anything to do with the problems the companies were facing. As if an executive buying a pricey suit was at all related to decades of shortsighted business models and inability to change in a shifting marketplace. As if an expensive dinner somehow had something to do with struggling but optimistic companies finding themselves in an extremely bad spot when the &lt;i&gt;rest&lt;/i&gt; of the market tanked around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So then we had the bailout bonus "scandal." Again, yes, it was stupid. Should they have done it? &lt;i&gt;Of course not!&lt;/i&gt; The guys who drove the companies in the ground should not get rewarded for their shitty leadership. But it's not the fucking issue! Millions in bonus money compared to &lt;i&gt;hundreds of billions&lt;/i&gt; in bailout money is &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/558/"&gt;small fucking potatoes&lt;/a&gt;. It's not the problem. It is merely a visible &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; onto which people can latch and direct their attention while, all the while, the real issues go ignored an unnoticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These companies are not going to stand or fall based on millions when billions are at stake, so stop pretending like they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And President Obama, when asked why he took a few days to register outrage about these bailout bonuses, said "Because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak." And that's a good answer. I like that answer. But it's not true. If he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; liked to know what he was talking about before he spoke, he would have said "Because it would be like getting angry that someone stole a single piece of hay from my haystack. There are bigger issues to deal with."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these irrelevant symbols take the place of the actual problems, and a smack on the wrist for handing out a comparative pittance to a failed boss is perceived as a solution, when in reality it's not even a band-aid. It's an economic placebo; it might make you feel better for a bit, but the problem will still be there at the end of the day. Unethical lending and trading practices, poor oversight, ineffective regulation; a perfect storm and train wreck rolled into one that people foresaw years ago, but never did anything to prevent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090330/ap_on_bi_ge/gm_wagoner"&gt;one of those symbols has lost his job&lt;/a&gt;, forced out by the government. From a practical perspective, I don't really give a shit that Rick Wagoner had to step down. To be completely frank, the rich have been trying desperately to screw people in my tax bracket for so long that, well, fuck 'em. But realistically speaking, this guy &lt;i&gt;is not the problem&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He inherited the problems, and my understanding is that he's worked his ass off to try to fix as many of them as possible. The plans and programs he implemented pre-meltdown had a seriously good chance of helping GM back up starting around 2010 when the most recent UAW contract changes took effect. That would also be the year of the wide-release of the Chevy Volt and a 45MPG replacement for the Chevy Cobalt that is already in production, and was well on its way there when the market collapsed. GM, in particular, was changing, and Wagoner was spearheading these changes to make the company competitive again, but then the market crash bitchslapped them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could he have done more? Certainly. But selling his corporate jet and docking his own personal salary are not among the things he could have done that would have helped for a shit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now he's fired, and the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; problems plaguing his company will continue. But the public has had its blood; the flag has been burnt and therefore the government lies in shambles, right? Wagoner is gone, the symbol of CEO decadence (itself a symbol for failing companies), so the problems should go away now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is endlessly frustrating that people will obsess over minutiae, that they'll knock down these symbols of the real, behind-the scenes issues and crow as if a great victory has been won. It only distracts from and perpetuates the real problems while giving a handy excuse for people to remain ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Why are the Big Three failing?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well, cause they spend all that money jet-setting around and getting big bonuses and eating at Morton's Steakhouse, that's why!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"What about a history of poor decision-making, massive legacy costs unrivaled by the younger Japanese car companies, excess cruft, and undeservedly bad PR?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No, it's those jets and the bonuses."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be nice if we could focus our attention on the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; problems instead of revoking bonuses and firing CEOs. I don't claim to be an expert on what they are, but I do think I know a bit more than anyone who pretends that completely irrelevant issues are the root of the problem. We need to be engaged in a careful dissection of exactly what caused the financial meltdown and hold people directly responsible. Perhaps we should address the failures in the system while ensuring that it won't poof into dust and give us another Great Depression. I don't fucking know what &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; fix the problem, but I certainly know what &lt;i&gt;won't&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing we need to be doing is this sorry, bullshit familiar magic, this empty economic voodoo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-4114374073829480941?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238486768496"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/homemade_advocacy">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29cf199ad68ed1d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Homemade Advocacy</title><published>2009-03-31T07:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T07:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/homemade_advocacy" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3400711134/" title="blue &amp;amp; green by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3400711134_f7bcaf2c29_m.jpg" height="240" alt="blue &amp;amp; green" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My son Charlie is not, as I have noted, a reader and thus, like more than a few children, has quite confuted the inclinations of his parents; so is a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/nyregion/long-island/29Rgen.html?ref=new-jersey"&gt;girly girl born to a tomboy&lt;/a&gt;, as writer Helene Stapinski wrote in last Friday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/nyregion/long-island/29Rgen.html?ref=new-jersey"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently I took especial note when, last night, I found Charlie looking with deep interest at the cover of a catalogue for &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/"&gt;Different Roads to Learning&lt;/a&gt;, from whom we've purchased a number of items over the years for teaching him.  The days have passed when Charlie did couple of sessions a week of ABA at the table in his room: He needs structure and schedules throughout his day as much as ever, but also needs much more to be up and about around the house, in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's teacher does home visits on Tuesday and Thursday and Jim was lecturing, so today it was Charlie and me. He hadn't wanted any of my snack offerings (the fridge tends to be a bit bare on Monday afternoon as he and I typically go shopping later on Monday; my mom had left some paper-wrapped chicken in the freezer, but Charlie said no to it). We went on a walk on what started to be a gray-cloud and wild-wind day, and ended up being an afternoon of brightening sunshine with blue sky above the green-becoming grass. Then we went shopping and each carried in a heavy bag of groceries and had dinner, after which Charlie settled himself in his favorite spot on the living room carpet. And that was where I spied him, eyes fixed on the catalogue cover, which featured a drawing of a treasure chest full of flashcards, books for teaching, puzzles, peg boards, blocks, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it was like instant memory mix for me. Tracking down those items and sitting with Charlie at his little blue Little Tykes table or on the floor and cleaning everything up and putting them away into shelves and bins for the next therapist, the next day: Once those were the principle activities of my days. I've since met Julie Azuma, who started &lt;a href="http://difflearn.com"&gt;Different Roads to Learning&lt;/a&gt;, and from time to time found things we needed from the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things we never got to, like materials for working on "Wh-" questions and conversation----I'll call those works in progress and to come. We actually bought few flashcards when Charlie was younger but cut out photos from books and magazines and catalogues and glued and laminated. I still remember sitting on the floor, cutting and gluing into the wee hours of the night, and alternately feeling astounded that I was doing these simple tasks with such passion, and ardently glad that I was. Making those cards, and laying three of them out at a time to teach Charlie language, was, in its own way, a kind of early, homemade, advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, we weren't thinking we'd go too far changing any aspect of the world besides teaching Charlie what we might. But something in the spirit and dedication we devoted to making those cards and to teaching Charlie, word by word and (when he learned to talk a few years later), sound by sound, has remained with me, whenever I sit in an IEP meeting or when I've been able to make it to an &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;IACC&lt;/a&gt; meeting; whenever I find myself at a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/nj_de-institutionalization_bill_a3625_change_amp_hope_for_the_future"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; or conference or a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/self_advocacy_in_policy_and_the_new_or_commission"&gt;statehouse&lt;/a&gt;, or just standing in the supermarket aisles with Charlie, quickly explaining to another customer why he takes so long at the sushi section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since those nights of flashcard making, and Charlie always reminds me of what it's all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalogue had also evoked a significant memory in Charlie. I knelt beside him, just as I used to, and found the pages with the Actions flashcards, the counting bears, the peg puzzles, the Soundtracks game, that Charlie had once learned from. Then I realized that Charlie was saying "pegs" and flipped back to the cover where, sure enough, off to the right side, was the &lt;a href="http://www.difflearn.com/product/Tall-Stacker_Pegboard/fine_motor_skills"&gt;very peg board&lt;/a&gt; (big plastic pegs with a blue foam "board") that had been one of his first-ever toys. It's a toy that was long ago left behind (I think when we left St. Louis in 2000, when Charlie was four years old) and it seemed time to turn to Hot Wheels and CandyLand and such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie looked for a few more minutes at the pictures in the catalogue, then left it on the floor. He'll be twelve in just about six weeks. It's become the time to put away the childish things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet I never can forget, it all started with &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-autistic-child-is-father-of-the-autistic-man/"&gt;this one child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238486624066"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=429">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3c92ea4cb27da1a2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="breast cancer"/><category term="cancer clusters"/><category term="causality"/><category term="ecological fallacy"/><category term="EMF"/><category term="epidemiology"/><category term="heart disease"/><category term="Kabat"/><category term="lung cancer"/><category term="passive smoking"/><category term="pesticides"/><category term="radon"/><category term="risks"/><category term="second-hand smoke"/><category term="smoking"/><title type="html">Hyping Health Risks</title><published>2009-03-31T08:00:59Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T08:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=429" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three kids on the same block were diagnosed with leukemia last year. That couldn’t happen just by chance, could it? There MUST be something in the environment that caused it (power lines, the chemical plant down the street, asbestos in their school, iPods, Twinkies?). Quick, let’s measure everything we can think of and compare exposures to other blocks and find an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be the common reaction, and it may seem plausible to the general public, but it’s not good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just read a book that does a great job of elucidating the pitfalls of epidemiologic studies, the problematic interface between science and emotion-laden public concerns, and the way environmental hazards have been hyped far beyond the evidence. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hyping-Health-Risks-Environmental-Epidemiology/dp/0231141483"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyping Health Risks: Environmental Hazards in Daily Life and the Science of Epidemiology &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;by Geoffrey C. Kabat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He covers the uses, strengths and limitations of epidemiology, discusses the pros and cons of different study designs, and explains how to judge whether an association is causal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ecological Fallacy and Determination of Causality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological studies based on groups rather than individuals can be misleading. Early researchers found a strong correlation between per capita sales of cigarettes and lung cancer; but there was also a strong correlation between sales of silk stockings and lung cancer. They had to look for other types of evidence before they could conclude there was a causal relationship. A study showed a strong correlation between dietary fat consumption and age-adjusted breast-cancer mortality in 41 countries, but that could be due to confounding factors like economic and lifestyle differences. The “ecological fallacy” is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the unwarranted assumption that, just because a given factor is correlated with a disease based on aggregate data, this suggests (1) that the same correlation will hold at the individual level or (2) that the association is indicative of a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical significance is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every finding that is statistically significant is biologically significant, but too often the fact that a given result is statistically significant is used to imply precisely this. More relevant to gauging the importance of a finding is the consistency with existing evidence from other sources and the impact on a population basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following criteria can be used to judge causality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magnitude of the association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Consistency (same effect shown in different studies carried out in different populations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Temporal relationship (cause must precede effect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Coherence of explanation (also known as biological plausibility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dose-response relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between smoking and lung cancer meets all those criteria. Kabat describes four cases in detail where those criteria were not met and where public concern and activism led to bad science and overblown fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the environment cause breast cancer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a public perception that there was an epidemic of breast cancer in certain areas of the country such as Long Island, and there was a conviction that some form of environmental pollution must play a role. In reality, there was no epidemic, and there is little evidence to support a role for the environment as a cause of breast cancer. Activists got a law passed mandating scientific projects, which were poorly designed and focused on specific pollutants like DDT, and got negative results, disappointing everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clusters of illness are inevitable. If you spill rice on a grid, there will be squares with lots of grains of rice and squares with none. The challenge is to determine whether a cluster of illness is due to anything more than chance. The public doesn’t understand this, and they demand an explanation for every apparent cluster. In one of Kabat’s examples, a community that had the highest rate of breast cancer one year had the lowest rate the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the concern about breast cancer into perspective, any environmental effect is bound to be small, while the rate of lung cancer is 1.5 times that of breast cancer and it is 90% preventable by smoking cessation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Electromagnetic Fields Cause Cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMF concerns are demolished by an understanding of the physics involved. Any effects of EMF are well below the level of thermal noise. One physicist concluded that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;there are good reasons to believe that weak ELF [extremely low frequency] fields can have no significant biological effect at the cell level – and no strong reason to believe otherwise…. He likened concern over weak EMF from power lines to the fear that leaves falling from trees could fracture a person’s skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences reviewed the evidence for an association of EMF with cancer, acknowledged that it was all either negative or weak and inconsistent, yet they made a politically cautious decision to classify EMF as a possible carcinogen – a decision that cannot be scientifically justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does residential radon exposure cause lung cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there radon in your house? How much? In which rooms? How long have you lived there? How much time did you spend in which rooms? How much radon was in your previous residence? Residential radon studies are hampered by the near impossibility of quantifying an individual’s exposure over time. And most of the studies are flawed by the failure to correct for smoking. The risk of radon exposure to smokers is high; the risk to non-smokers is questionable. The way to reduce lung cancer deaths from radon is not to test everyone’s home and try to lower radon exposure – it is to get people to stop smoking. A 20% increase in risk of lung cancer from radon exposure (including smokers and non-smokers) must be put into perspective with the 2000% increase in risk from smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Second-Hand Smoke Cause Lung Cancer and Heart Disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little different because we are reasonably sure there is a risk and we know the mechanism. The problem is that the risk is  small and difficult to measure accurately, and Kabat argues that it is practically impossible to quantify an individual’s exposure to second-hand smoke over long periods of time. Studies have compared the spouses of smokers to the spouses of non-smokers, but some smokers bombard their spouses with clouds of smoke while others considerately smoke out on the porch, and we have no way of knowing whether the non-smoking spouses were exposed to smoke at work or elsewhere. Other studies have measured cotinine (a nicotine derivative) in the urine of those exposed to second-hand smoke, but the test only represents one point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association of heart disease with passive smoking is much weaker than the association with lung cancer, and anti-smoking activists lost all credibility when they extrapolated from poor data and tried to claim that passive smoking caused 50,000 cardiac deaths a year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;99.99% of the Pesticides in Our Diet are Natural and Unavoidable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong ideological environmental movement that is predisposed to find dangers from artificial chemicals in our environment. They seldom put those fears into perspective with natural and unavoidable chemicals. Bruce Ames, originator of the Ames test, a biological assay to identify carcinogens, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2217210?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;co-wrote a paper &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;showing that 99.99% of pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves. About half of the natural pesticides that have been tested are carcinogenic in rodents. They concluded that “natural and synthetic chemicals are equally likely to be positive in animal cancer tests. We also conclude that at the low doses of most human exposures the comparative hazards of synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this book will give you a better understanding of what epidemiology can and can’t do, and insight into how the rational scientific process can be perverted by the press, politicians, and grass-roots activists. One unstated take-home lesson from this book is that we should worry less about potential small environmental dangers and do something about the very large and preventable environmental danger of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

Engaging the 'Truth' of Evolution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;John is the only one of the four evangelists who recounts Jesus' (possibly apocryphal) statement to Pilate that he was in fact a king whose role was "to bear witness to the truth; and all who are on the side of truth listen to my voice." Pilate is said to have replied to this, "What is truth?"

&lt;p&gt;This is a question that Jerry Coyne never really engages in his excellent new book [1], which purports to explain why evolution is "true." This raises the question of who his intended audience is. But we'll get there in a minute. First, make no mistake: this is a wonderful book, as far as the explanation of many of the interesting lines of evidence and case histories for evolution go. Coyne is a professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in the genetics of speciation (his previous book on the subject, with H. Allen Orr, is widely recognized [2]). He explains the evidence for evolution not just in terms of speciation, however. He revisits many of Darwin's arguments, such as the progression of fossils, the importance of vestigial organs, how evolution explains biogeographic patterns, and sexual selection. But he is also able to go far beyond the evidence available to Darwin, with topics such as genetic and molecular support for species divergence, and the record of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004852" title=""&gt;Hydrodynamics-Based Functional Forms of Activity Metabolism: A Case for the Power-Law Polynomial Function in Animal Swimming Energetics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first-degree power-law polynomial function is frequently used to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals. This function has been used in hydrodynamics-based metabolic studies to evaluate important parameters of energetic costs, such as the standard metabolic rate and the drag power indices. In theory, however, the power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than one can be used to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals. In fact, activity metabolism has been described by the conventional exponential function and the cubic polynomial function, although only the power-law polynomial function models drag power since it conforms to hydrodynamic laws. Consequently, the first-degree power-law polynomial function yields incorrect parameter values of energetic costs if activity metabolism is governed by the power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than one. This issue is important in bioenergetics because correct comparisons of energetic costs among different steady swimming animals cannot be made unless the degree of the power-law polynomial function derives from activity metabolism. In other words, a hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity metabolism is a power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than or equal to one. Therefore, the degree of the power-law polynomial function should be treated as a parameter, not as a constant. This new treatment not only conforms to hydrodynamic laws, but also ensures correct comparisons of energetic costs among different steady swimming animals. Furthermore, the exponential power-law function, which is a new hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity metabolism, is a special case of the power-law polynomial function. Hence, the link between the hydrodynamics of steady swimming and the exponential-based metabolic model is defined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000081" title=""&gt;Getting the Measure of Positional Information&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that underlie pattern formation is one of the major challenges of developmental biology. The complexity and beauty of the patterns on butterfly wings, fish scales, or bird feathers are not only remarkable products of developmental processes but puzzles that tease our intellects. If we are to understand these beautiful products of cellular activity, we need to first investigate simpler patterns, which are more tractable experimentally. A good example is the subdivision of an embryo along its main axis, which can be represented as a polarized subdivision of a cellular field. Over 40 years ago, Lewis Wolpert offered a conceptual solution to this problem in the form of the French Flag model [1]. The central element of the proposal is that spatial gradients of substances called morphogens are the cause of such subdivision (Figure 1, left panel). The idea is simple: specific concentration thresholds in the gradient are detected by cells in the target tissue and lead to the expression of distinct sets of target genes. The crucial ingredient of the argument was a precise and direct correlation between the input (the gradient) and the output (the response of the tissue)--each threshold corresponds precisely to a border of an expression territory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005096" title=""&gt;A Top-Down Approach to Infer and Compare Domain-Domain Interactions across Eight Model Organisms&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Knowledge of specific domain-domain interactions (DDIs) is essential to understand the functional significance of protein interaction networks. Despite the availability of an enormous amount of data on protein-protein interactions (PPIs), very little is known about specific DDIs occurring in them. Here, we present a top-down approach to accurately infer functionally relevant DDIs from PPI data. We created a comprehensive, non-redundant dataset of 209,165 experimentally-derived PPIs by combining datasets from five major interaction databases. We introduced an integrated scoring system that uses a novel combination of a set of five orthogonal scoring features covering the probabilistic, evolutionary, evidence-based, spatial and functional properties of interacting domains, which can map the interacting propensity of two domains in many dimensions. This method outperforms similar existing methods both in the accuracy of prediction and in the coverage of domain interaction space. We predicted a set of 52,492 high-confidence DDIs to carry out cross-species comparison of DDI conservation in eight model species including human, mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, Plasmodium, E. coli and Arabidopsis. Our results show that only 23% of these DDIs are conserved in at least two species and only 3.8% in at least 4 species, indicating a rather low conservation across species. Pair-wise analysis of DDI conservation revealed a 'sliding conservation' pattern between the evolutionarily neighboring species. Our methodology and the high-confidence DDI predictions generated in this study can help to better understand the functional significance of PPIs at the modular level, thus can significantly impact further experimental investigations in systems biology research.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000074" title=""&gt;A Computational Framework for Ultrastructural Mapping of Neural Circuitry&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Building an accurate neural network diagram of the vertebrate nervous system is a major challenge in neuroscience. Diverse groups of neurons that function together form complex patterns of connections often spanning large regions of brain tissue, with uncertain borders. Although serial-section transmission electron microscopy remains the optimal tool for fine anatomical analyses, the time and cost of the undertaking has been prohibitive. We have assembled a complete framework for ultrastructural mapping using conventional transmission electron microscopy that tremendously accelerates image analysis. This framework combines small-molecule profiling to classify cells, automated image acquisition, automated mosaic formation, automated slice-to-slice image registration, and large-scale image browsing for volume annotation. Terabyte-scale image volumes requiring decades or more to assemble manually can now be automatically built in a few months. This makes serial-section transmission electron microscopy practical for high-resolution exploration of all complex tissue systems (neural or nonneural) as well as for ultrastructural screening of genetic models.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005091" title=""&gt;The Brightness of Colour&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this 'illusion' to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies. Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI. The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, this time they made the mistake of invoking the very sensitive subject of the Holocaust in Germany, a country that doesn’t much care for free speech when it comes to provocative statements relating to the Holocaust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany’s supreme court has ruled that a series of PETA ads comparing factory farming to the Holocaust are “an offense against human dignity” and not protected speech. The ads show pictures of concentration camps next to pictures of animal farms and bear the slogan “The Holocaust on your plate”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a passionate defender of free speech, I’ve never supported Germany in these cases, even when they usually involve those whose messages I too find distasteful. So unfortunately I got to stand with PETA on this one, despite the overall idiocy of their message and their foolishness in thinking they could get away with this kind of crap in Germany. Though maybe this is exactly what they wanted to have happen and this was just a less transparent version of the tactic they pulled with their recent Superbowl commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The headmaster believes that the outrageous rumors had reached a point where she had to say something to families to ensure that all students felt safe and respected,” said Chris Horan, School Department spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident said a group of girls at the school had been bullying at least one other student who likes to dress in Goth-style, a vampirish look popularized by musician Marilyn Manson. The officials said the girls began spreading a rumor that the student was a vampire who had cut someone’s neck and sucked the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Boston police went to the school Wednesday on an unrelated matter, their presence fueled yet another rumor: that a vampire was being arrested, according to one of the law enforcement sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renata Galvan, who was a victim of this reckless endorsement of psychic powers, has some interesting news on the actual facts about Baron's involvement in the investigation of the murder of her son Tim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing you concerning so called psychic Carla Baron. I think you guys were absolutely correct that she is all out for the publicity. My son's case was featured on "Haunting Evidence" as its second episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carla claims she was going in blind on the case, and that was so far from the truth. She talked to me EVERY DAY for several months, pretending to be my friend and to help me. All the while she would direct me to bulletin boards to praise her efforts and defend her when skeptics would write about her.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238476429682"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2708">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3eb75fb7d1ce1187</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="American Family Association"/><category term="homophobia"/><category term="Christopher Hitchens"/><category term="David Icke"/><category term="House"/><category term="Seth MacFarlane"/><category term="Family Guy"/><category term="Fox TV"/><category term="Adam Corolla"/><category term="God Delusion"/><category term="Hulu"/><title type="html">Fox: The unlikely home of godless heathens</title><published>2009-03-31T05:11:34Z</published><updated>2009-03-31T05:11:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/fox-the-unlikely-home-of-godless-heathens/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;span&gt;House on atheism:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A Baltimore cult. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .denied a 16-month-old boy food and water because he did not say “Amen” at mealtimes. After he died, they prayed over his body for days, expecting a resurrection, then packed it into a suitcase with mothballs. They left it in a shed in Philadelphia, where it remained for a year before detectives found it last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that those responsible, including the child’s mother, Ria Ramkissoon, are being tried for murder. And the bad news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrists who evaluated Ramkissoon at the request of a judge concluded that she was not criminally insane. Her attorney, Steven Silverman, said the doctors found that her beliefs were indistinguishable from religious beliefs, in part because they were shared by those around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;She wasn’t delusional, because she was following a religion&lt;/strong&gt;,” Silverman said, describing the findings of the doctors’ psychiatric evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I certainly agree with him that her beliefs are indeed indistinguishable from religious beliefs, but I don’t think the doctors reached the logical conclusion on that position. Really, you can’t figure out why such delusional, destructive beliefs seem so similar to religion? Really guys, it’s not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;

Her combination of obnoxiousness, the arrogance of ignorance, and a dogged determination to stoke the embers of the discredited idea that vaccines somehow cause autism have endangered public health in this country in the year and a half since she published her first autism book. Worse, hers is the face that launched a thousand quacks, autism quacks, that is, as she has has repeatedly claimed on the Oprah Winfrey show that she "cured" her son Evan with biomedical woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I do so love a good takedown. Two, in fact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com"&gt;The Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Jenny McCarthy's antivaccine misinformation may very well have a body count before it's all over.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-dickerman/vaccine-denial-scientific_b_180026.html"&gt;Vaccine Denial = Scientific Illiteracy&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely NSFW because Jacob Dickerman seems to be channeling &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;Comrade PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines, but very amusing and spot on. More amazingly, it's an actual voice of sanity with regard to vaccines on the Huffington Post! Shocking, I know. Scientists had better check to make sure the earth is still spinning properly on its axis. What makes me think that it still is is that antivaccine loons like Nancy Hokkanen have shown up, along with the other antivax hordes who read HuffPo.&lt;/li&gt;

Now only do I love the site for linking to my own site, Stop &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, but also because it illustrates possibly the real world harm of anti-vaccine propaganda.

But I can’t help throwing out a couple more things, in case you somehow missed them. In recent weeks Jon Stewart, in his inimitable way, has been asking a truly important question: why did the business media completely and totally miss the Wall Street meltdown? Aren’t they supposed to be doing investigative reporting? Aren’t they supposed to be asking the hard questions, uncovering wrong-doing, and thereby informing and protecting the public? With all the resources at their disposal, how could they completely and totally miss the most profound economic event since the great depression? The truth, of course, is that the mainstream media coverage of Wall Street is a farce. It consists of interviews with CEOs and stock pickers, and advice and analysis that isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on (or the photons your TV/computer monitor emits). There are very few true business reporters out there (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Morgenson"&gt;Gretchen Morgenson&lt;/a&gt; of the New York Times being my favorite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first must-see show consists of Jon Stewart doing a take-down of CNBC (a cable channel devoted solely to business). The show includes plenty of clips from CNBC “experts” (including Jim Cramer) making statements and stock-picking suggestions which turn out to be spectacularly wrong. It is truly brilliant and instructive:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later Jim Cramer was a guest on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, presumably to defend his (and CNBC’s) honor. It is simultaneously one of the most entertaining and disturbing interviews I’ve ever seen (though nothing compares to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nokTjEdaUGg"&gt;Sarah Palin interviews&lt;/a&gt;). Jim Cramer is the host of a show on CNBC called Mad Money. The basic premise of the show is that Cramer, a former hedge fund manager, will “make you money” by telling you which stocks to buy or sell. The problem, of course, is that he has no idea what he’s doing (see &lt;a href="http://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/Cramer/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2158497/fr/flyout"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  This is not a stab at him particularly, since I believe that aside from a truly tiny set of individuals, none of these fund managers or traders has any clue, and for the most part they all do roughly average (within expected deviations depending on their assumed risk). But I digress. In the interview Jon Stewart completely dismantles Jim Cramer, showing him to be essentially a fraud. Or, more to the point, he is providing entertainment, not actual financial advice. It is an astounding admission, from one of the most watched financial advisors in the world. What we need is more investigative journalism, and less snake-oil salesmanship. Here is the interview:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send a complaint to YouTube demanding these accounts be reinstated. None of them is guilty of copyright infringement or hate speech of any kind. Someone or more likely someones are almost certainly repeatedly flagging their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should concern everyone, regardless of whether or not you agree with their positions, because this is a free speech issue. Last year, when the YouTube posterboy for creationist stupidity, VenomFangX, had his account unfairly suspended, atheists and others who accept Evolution fought to get his account reactivated. This goes beyond personal politics and beyond religion. An attack on free speech is an attack on us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I got back a graded essay, which happened to be worth a significant portion of my grade. I got a C and was immediately upset because I had been somewhat proud of my work when I was writing it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I soon perused the plethora of red marks throughout the paper and began to notice generally why I did poorly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The principle reason I got a C was because I didn't have enough &lt;b&gt;"evidence,"&lt;/b&gt; as this particular paper required a certain amount of references to sources read throughout the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "plethora of red marks" is an indication that there might be a lot of problems with that paper, and it's certainly true that we professors have expectations of a certain level of scholarship, that is, familiarity with multiple sources, in undergraduate work. It's good that Mr Friend recognizes these shortcomings in his work. Or does he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Friend identifies a bigger problem. It&amp;#39;s not his fault, it&amp;#39;s the academic world, which demands…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic world our generation has grown up in gives an enormous amount of credit to &lt;b&gt;empirical, tangible and scientific evidence&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, really? That sounds reasonable to me. What does Mr Friend want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we have been accustomed to perceive intelligence as a product of one's ability to present concrete evidence, especially scientifically. Not to say this is completely wrong or ineffective, but I think we must consider the possibility of metaphysical realities. And maybe, just maybe, we live in world that can't always be explained rationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see. He wants to write an irrational paper that lacks empirical evidence and is built on intangible claims, and he wants to get an A for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does he think he is studying? Liberty University?&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast to the plethora of books on Darwin marking the bicentennial of his birth and the sesquicentennial of the publication of &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_OntheOriginofSpecies.html" rel="external "&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;, which tend to focus on the development of the science and the mature man, Simons’ book asked ‘What was it like for Charles Darwin, a young guy just out of college, to visit all those places that were so foreign to him and the culture in which he had been raised?’  Could a 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century Californian, not much older than Darwin’s age at the time, recapture some of the feelings Darwin recorded himself as having in his &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;amp;itemID=F1925&amp;amp;pageseq=1" rel="external "&gt; Beagle Diary&lt;/a&gt; if he trekked up as far as he could toward the headwaters of the Rio Santa Cruz, as Darwin, Fitzroy, and some crewmen of the Beagle did?  Would Tierra del Fuego elicit the same feelings of revulsion and fascination?  Is the inland of Patagonia &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; that barren?  And was that really Charles Darwin, aboard the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; called “Philosopher,” traveling overland on horseback for weeks with a party of gauchos, sleeping rough every night with a saddle for a pillow, meeting a revolutionary general and talking his way through hostile lines to get into town?  Who is that cowboy anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And did anyone in those places Darwin visited know that he was there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons didn’t track Darwin’s travels slavishly, but in separate trips to the east and west coasts of South America visited a number of the places and repeated a number of the inland trips Darwin recorded in his Beagle diary (linked above).  Simons climbed some of the peaks Darwin climbed, seeing (more or less) the same views that impressed Darwin, and followed some of the rivers Darwin followed inland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book Simons notices the changes – and in some cases the lack of changes – from Darwin’s day.  He tries to find the witch cave on Chiloe, a legend that Darwin had missed, but only experiences the island’s miserable winter weather of which Darwin remarked “We were all glad to leave Chiloe; at the time of year nothing but an amphibious animal could tolerate the climate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will skip over Simons’ description of “The Adventure of the Beagle,” a musical in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego.  You have to read it yourself, or perhaps imagine it with your Monty Python goggles on.  I’ll reproduce just the chorus from one song sung by the crew:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ll fight the roaring seas
&lt;br&gt;We shall face no defeat
&lt;br&gt;All across the Seven Seas
&lt;br&gt;The Beagle will succeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simons climbs the highest peak of Ceros Tres Picos alone, a peak spotted from 50 miles away by Captain Fitzroy aboard the Beagle, whereas Darwin, also climbing alone, took a wrong turning due to an informant’s bad instructions and failed to reach the top of the highest of the three peaks.  Simons got better instructions from a local physical education instructor, but he sympathizes with Darwin’s clear frustration at failing to make the highest peak, as recorded in his diary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the course of the Rio Santa Cruz in a rental car, Simons sees essentially the same environment Darwin saw, but Simons has an advantage: He knows that the river that had turned frustratingly tortuous for Darwin and Fitzroy would straighten soon.  They didn’t know that, and running low on rations and energy from laboring upstream for three weeks, all hands toiling along the river’s bank hauling their boats upstream with towropes, the Beagle expedition turned back and didn’t reach the headwaters of the river.  Both Fitzroy and Darwin were disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the book. describing a scene along the Rio Claro near where Darwin sought its confluence with the Rio Elque, Simons wrote what I think is the best short summary of Darwin the man that I’ve read.  He wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a danger in labeling someone a genius; it makes them inaccessible.  Darwin the Genius is beyond the reach of sympathy.  But Darwin the person–the one who stood and watched the sunset over this same river, the one who would happily join in with Josh and I in skipping rocks–well, he was a lot like us.  He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; us.  His career-crowning idea of evolution by natural selection is a triumph of human achievement that sprang from the perfectly achievable endeavors of careful observation, meticulous note-taking, and joyous, boundless curiosity. (p 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a heavy book.  It’s an easy and enjoyable read, but it nevertheless brings into clearer view what it must have been like for Darwin the young English man to see exotic sights he could never have imagined when he was Oxford, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JrvrjdlhQbkC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=von+Humboldt&amp;amp;ei=7lzRSffDNYnWlQSRur2UAQ#PPA5,M1" rel="external "&gt;Alexander von Humboldt’s travel narrative&lt;/a&gt; notwithstanding.  Darwin read von Humboldt, but he &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; the voyage of the Beagle and Simons gives us a flavor of what that must have been like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added in edit: Simons has &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/print/darwin_slept_here/" rel="external "&gt;a photo essay about his travels&lt;/a&gt; on the Web for Seed Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

Sennett of the book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Natural-Theology-Post-humean-Assessment/dp/0830827676/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1238338859&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;In Defense of Natural Theology&lt;/a&gt;. [Sennett has recently explained that while he has doubts he still believes, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/still-believer-james-f-sennett-responds.html"&gt;seen here&lt;/a&gt;]. Groothuis is presently writing an apologetics book which I think will be the best of the lot and perhaps the standard text for years to come. Here is his submitted essay unedited and without comment: &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Straw God: Understanding the New Atheism, Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(originally published at www.TrueU.org) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;            “There is no God, and I hate him!” This seems to be the subtext for much of the “new atheism” propounded in books by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and others. What distinguishes this new breed of unbelief is, in part, its vehemence and vitriol. The gloves are off. Religion—all religion—is not just false, but dangerous to civilization itself. Dawkins concludes his book &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion &lt;/em&gt;by arguing that raising children religiously is a form of child abuse. Hitchens concurs. God, given his bad reputation, must be banished from the universe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Behind much of the atheism of today is a false view of God and religion. The straw man fallacy occurs when someone presents a weak or inaccurate view of a position and then cuts it down. Atheists are often guilty of this fallacy with respect to God. This may be called the straw god fallacy: a false idea of God is easily refuted. While responding to all the fallacious arguments of the new atheists would take a book in itself, we can, nevertheless, highlight two of their basic errors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error #1: All Religion is Similarly Irrational&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            First, the new atheists view religion as a piece. Thus, a few deft blows to the sacred head can disarm and destroy all religion as irrational. Sam Harris is a particularly egregious offender in this matter. But religions differ markedly concerning their basic worldviews as well as their means of intellectually defending themselves. For example, Mormonism is based on indemonstrable historical claims and relies heavily on subjective experience to verify itself.[1] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Historic Christianity, on the contrary, is well rooted in objective historical facts. The New Testament was written a short time after the events it describes and by eyewitness or those who consulted eyewitnesses (Luke 1:1-4; John 21:24). Crucial events described in the New Testament are corroborated by extra-biblical historians and by archaeology.[2] The original manuscripts of the New Testament have been reliably transmitted over time.[3] Further, while spiritual experiences are central to Christianity,[4] it does not hang its entire credibility on them, since the evidence from history and nature is strong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Therefore, Christopher Hitchens’s arguments against Mormonism in &lt;em&gt;god is Not Great &lt;/em&gt;may succeed without having any implications for Christianity.[5] Similarly, an atheist may argue against Buddhism and Hinduism by rightly claiming that they are mystical religions that are unanchored from history and deny the significance and worth of the material world. But these criticisms have no force against Christianity, given its stubborn historicity and its affirmation of the universe as created good by God and redeemed by God himself through the Incarnation (John 1:1, 14).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error #2: No Arguments for God Succeed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            The new atheists believe that the idea of God as Creator and Designer is irrational, a mere leap of blind faith. Atheists are (rightly) angry at this notion of a God who requires intellectual suicide for belief and worship. Yet their indignation fails to disprove God’s existence. Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens decline to take seriously the strongest arguments for God. Instead, they present weak arguments and then tear them down. Yet there are powerful arguments for God’s existence, which gain in power the more science reveals about the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Evidence for Big Bang cosmology has accumulated over several decades, making it the most established scientific account of the origin of the cosmos. According to this account, everything came into being out of nothing in the far distant past.[6] This conclusion takes away atheism’s old security blanket: There is no need for God, since the universe has always existed. But if the universe came into existence at some point, we are left with only two options. (1) It came into existence without a cause or (2) It came into existence with a cause. Option (1) is either impossible or profoundly unlikely, given our sense of cause and effect. We assume that material events have causes that explain their existence. To deny that the universe had a cause means that it popped into existence. This is what philosopher Dallas Willard calls “big bang mysticism.” It is far more rational to believe that whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence. If this is so, then it must be inferred that something outside the universe was the cause of the universe. The best candidate is a personal agent of unlimited power.[7] “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Evidence is also mounting that the universe is designed to be inhabited by humans. This is evidenced through the complex and intricate fine tuning of various aspects of the world. Many constants in the universe have infinitesimal margins of error. If any of them were only slightly off, there could be no humans. Physicist Martin Rees notes that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.      Our universe could not have become structured if it were not expanding at a particular rate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.      If the big bang had produced few density fluctuations, the universe would have remained dark, with no galaxies or stars &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.      If our universe had more than three spatial dimensions, planets could not stay in orbits around stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.      If gravity were much stronger, it would crush living organisms of human size, and stars would be small and short lived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5.      If the nuclear force were a few percent weaker, only hydrogen would be stable: there would be no periodic table, no chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Rees claims that this does not indicate that a Designer fine-tuned the universe for life. It is all sheer, dumb luck. “Some would argue that this fine-tuning of the universe, which seems so providential, is nothing to be surprised about, since we could not exist otherwise.”[8] Rees dismisses these fine-tuned aspects of the universe—and there are many others—as accidental, not designed. But in doing so, he confuses two very different things: (1) the factors that must be the case for us to exist and to observe the universe and (2) the explanation for the highly improbable configurations that allow us to exist to observe the universe. This highly improbably arrangement surely cries out for an explanation, not a truism. If all these factors are in place, then we will exist and observe them, but this does not account for why these factors came into place in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Faced with the fine-tuning problem, atheists may also appeal to the “many universe theory,” which claims that our universe is not really unlikely because it is merely one of countless other universes that lack the sophisticated fine-tuning required for life. Ours is simply the lucky universe. But this theory is a desperate “hail Mary” pass at the end of a game that the atheists are losing badly. There is no evidence for other universes; they are merely postulated to banish God from this one. This is purely ad hoc.[9]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            More could be said about the new atheists’ straw god arguments. Their claim that all religions are irrational is false because it disregards the significant differences between religions—differences that make a difference. Moreover, their assertion that one must be irrational to believe in God is false. The existence of a God can be inferred rationally on the basis of solid and sufficient scientific evidence. Additionally, the historical evidence for Christianity is very strong—although I discussed it only briefly. The atheism of Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens may be new, but it is not true. Their straw god is not the real God who created and designed the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] See Walter Martin, &lt;em&gt;The Kingdom of the Cults&lt;/em&gt;, revised edition, Hank Hanegraaff, general editor (Minneapolis, MN: Bethany House, 1997), chapter six.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] See Craig Blomberg, &lt;em&gt;The Historical Reliability of the Gospels&lt;/em&gt;, 20th anniversary edition (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] See Timothy Paul Jones, &lt;em&gt;Misquoting Truth A Guide to the Fallacies of Bart Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus&lt;/em&gt; (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[4] For the argument for God from religious experience, see J.P.

Background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Congress passed legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act--the Higher Education Opportunity Act.  This law includes sweeping new provisions intended to expand access to higher education to students with disabilities, including students with intellectual disabilities.  In addition, the law contains provisions to improve the preparation of K-12 general education teachers and college faculty who prepare new teachers in special education and other shortage areas.  However, these exciting new provisions require funding to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for action is &lt;em&gt;Wednesday, April 1&lt;/em&gt;, so if you're interested, &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/03/action-alert-urge-congress-to-fund-higher-education-for-students-with-disabilities.html"&gt;act quickly&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AUCD has a number of resources related to intellectual and developmental disabilities in &lt;a href="http://www.aucd.org/template/page.cfm?id=27"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on &lt;a href="http://www.aucd.org/template/page.cfm?id=508"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional autism-related policy information, the National Conference of Sate Legislatures has put up the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/autism.htm"&gt;NCSL Autism Legislation Database&lt;/a&gt; (link to database as well as background article and legislative glossary).  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238454424192"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6696">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/006f2a71e092f752</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="ghost photos"/><category term="little atoms"/><category term="richard wiseman"/><title type="html">Excellent Wiseman Interview, and TAM London</title><published>2009-03-30T23:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T23:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6696" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://www.littleatoms.com/sounds/richardwiseman.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="13442114"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4af58566587f868164f2085bcbfe08d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t posted in a few weeks because, amongst other things, I’m busy organising TAM London on behalf of JREF. The official website is now live at &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;www.tamlondon.org&lt;/a&gt;, although registration is not yet open (join the mailing list for notification of when it is). Confirmed speakers include Richard Dawkins, Adam Savage, Jon Ronson, and many others, including of course Randi and Phil Plait. Perhaps most exciting of all is that Richard Wiseman has agreed to MC the event, which means we get him for the entire thing. Anyone who has attended one of his talks will know that he’s the top-rated TAM speaker year after year for a reason - the perfect mix of accessible science and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I don’t always agree with him, and I admit that his recent media activity to promote the forthcoming Edinburgh Science Festival event &lt;a href="http://www.scienceofghosts.com/"&gt;Science of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; pushed my ‘annoyed’ button. In case you missed it, a call for examples of ‘ghost’ photographs, and a subsequent ‘top ten’ as voted by the public resulted in a storm of media coverage, most of which proclaimed that ‘experts’ (i.e. Prof Wiseman) were ‘baffled’. At a loss for an explanation. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was not the case, and Wiseman &lt;a href="http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/hauntings-results-out/"&gt;refuted the claim&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. Although the blog is well-read, it’s not as well-read as, say, The Sun newspaper, which reaches some 8 million (not including online), which proclaimed an &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2343015.ece"&gt;“eerie image has got ghost experts spooked”&lt;/a&gt;. My immediate reaction to the media coverage and the “OMG it’s a ghost!” comments which accompanied it was “how does this help educate anyone? Isn’t it just encouraging people to think there’s evidence of ghosts when there’s no such evidence?”. I don’t think I was the only one to have this reaction, judging from comments in the skeptisphere (did I just invent that term?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that right? The requirement to promote the Science of Ghost event aside, is this sort of PR coverage counter-productive? If so, counter-productive to what? And as if by magic, today I got to hear a very good, brand new interview with Wiseman that had changed my perspective on this story. The interview is from Little Atoms, one of the premier science and skeptical podcasts out there, it’s free and can be &lt;a href="http://www.littleatoms.com/sounds/richardwiseman.mp3"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, as it’s Wiseman, it fairly rapidly descends into very funny banter, but there’s also some nice chat at the end about TAM London which I am very happy about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still dislike the silly spin the media put on the ghost photo story, but I have come to understand, and to a large extent agree with, the theory of the ‘bigger picture’ (excuse the pun), that the dialogue ensuing from such stories is empowering to the public, and that is more productive than outright dismissal by ’stuffy’ skeptics. Yes, some people are going to read it and take it as evidence for ghosts. Those people want to believe anyway. What is negativity going to do to educate them? Nothing. But an awful lot of everyday people are going to look at the story and say “HAH! That’s doctored or fake. Ghosts my arse”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging people to debate, examine and discuss the paranormal in this way will arguably do more than many “scientists dismiss photo as bunkum” stories. Everyone loves to have an opinion, and when it comes to getting people to think for themselves, isn’t being provocative one of the best methods? I think it may be. Have a listen to the interview and let me know if you agree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238454178526"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/30/confickerc-worm-may-unleash-pc-madness-april-1/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/447487dbd4b348a6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Conficker.C worm may unleash PC madness April 1</title><published>2009-03-30T23:00:25Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T23:00:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/30/confickerc-worm-may-unleash-pc-madness-april-1/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not a joke: there is a worm getting spread on PCs called Conficker.C that will be activated on April 1 (no, this is not a joke) and may cause huge disruptions in the ‘net.

In this post, I consider the examples Matt provides as the "DO" and "DON'T" pictures for the application of these guiding ethical principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The present post has been prompted by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/2009/03/the_ethics_of_framing_science.php"&gt;Matt's recent post on the ethics of framing science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't the stomach for another round of the framing wars (or the attempt at analysis from here on the sidelines), come back later for tasty framing-free content:  This afternoon I'll be posting an illustration by the elder Free-Ride offspring, and this evening I'll be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/spring_keeps_on_springing_audi.php"&gt;revealing the identities of the mystery crops in my garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those still reading, here's my plan:  First, in this post, I'll consider the four ethical principles Matt says ought to be guiding scientists, journalists, and other communicators who are framing science.  In the next post, I'll say something about what seems to be going on when proponents of the framing strategy object that scientists are not applying it correctly.  Finally, I'll try to draw some broader lessons about the folks interested in communicating science - and about the strategies that might be useful (or counterproductive) in trying to sell scientists on the utility of the framing strategy.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Jenny McCarthy has a body count attached to her name. This website will publish the total number of vaccine preventable illnesses and vaccine preventable deaths that have happened since June 2007 when she began publicly speaking out against vaccines.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Is Jenny McCarthy directly responsible for every vaccine preventable illness and every vaccine preventable death listed here? No. However, as the unofficial spokesperson for the United States anti-vaccination movement she may be indirectly responsible for at least some of these illnesses and deaths and even one vaccine preventable illness or vaccine preventable death is too many.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The science is in. Children are exposed to more new pathogens on a daily basis than the entirety of what they&amp;#39;re given in their vaccination schedule, you get more formaldehyde into your body from the paint on your walls, and even if it was still in the childhood vaccination schedule (which it&amp;#39;s not), the amount of mercury in thimerosal is orders of magnitude below what it would take to actually damage your brain. Vaccines do not cause autism. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella are not diseases we should let come back. Allowing these &amp;quot;green our vaccines&amp;quot; Evidence of Harm &amp;quot;Mercury Militia&amp;quot; people to have their pre-scientific crap pollute our public discourse is retarding our nation&amp;#39;s health, and we can&amp;#39;t stand for it anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Third,&lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com/"&gt; StopJenny.com:
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Why Stop Jenny McCarthy?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 She talks trash about autism
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 She talks trash about immunizations
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 She talks about trash treatments
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Stop the trash talk Jenny McCarthy!
 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Fourth,

&lt;a href="http://icbseverywhere.com/blog/2009/03/30/keep-tabs-on-ignorance/"&gt;Keep Tabs on the Consequences of Jenny McCarthy’s Ignorance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifth, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/28/antivaxxers-and-their-trouble-with-truth/"&gt;Antivaxxers and their trouble with truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some antiscience is a pain in the neck, and some kills. Think, people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Think.

For proof, I present one Illinois Congresscritter named John Shimkus. In a recent hearing, he claimed that man cannot destroy the Earth, only God can do that. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7h08RDYA5E"&gt;Here’s the video&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/_7h08RDYA5E%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; video. He says he thinks the Bible is inerrant, and he says quite clearly that Man cannot do harm to the Earth. It’s clear he’s talking global warming here; he even says in the video we may need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; carbon pollution in the atmosphere! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go out and pollute, waste energy, whatever. We’ll just make more of whatever we use up, and if it damages the planet, well, we can just let God sort it out. And this may shock you, but it turns out Shimkus &lt;a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/2008/09/19/more-on-shimkus-rant"&gt;is a big coal advocate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often wonder when I hear politicians talking like this… do they believe in the End Times, and that it’s their duty to bring about the predictions in Revelation about the Apocalypse? Remember, Congress can vote on declarations of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, Illinois? What gives here?&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like I'm going out a bit on a limb here with the topic of this post which was instigated by reading an article in today's &lt;a href="http://theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2498560.0.Sympathy_can_hinder_disabled_pupils_in_class.php"&gt;Scotsman&lt;/a&gt; about how Scottish researchers at Strathclyde University have found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers who are overly sympathetic to children with learning difficulties or physical disabilities can hold them back in the classroom.&lt;br&gt;
....&lt;br&gt;
teachers who did not feel "overwhelmed with sympathy" were more likely to challenge disabled pupils, and to expect more from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also found that attitudes of teachers towards children with learning difficulties were not improved by training programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;199 Scottish teachers were accessed regarding their "levels of sympathy" and "classroom attitudes," in order to evaluate how the policy of mainstreaming is working in schools in Scotland. It was found that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;....teachers who did not feel overwhelmed with sympathy "saw the children's difficulties as less stable and therefore more amenable to change".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A person who feels a great deal of sympathy may respond to the disabled individual differently from non-disabled people," it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If a teacher sees a learner as not being in control, the teacher is more likely to provide help. If help is provided on a task that the learner does not see as challenging, the help could be interpreted as . . . transmitting to the learner the message that they are of low ability and likely to need help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is not about "being mean," of course, but about the extent to which teachers feel "overwhelmed with sympathy," and about how this feeling affects their teaching. I'll hazard that one can replace "sympathy" with "feeling sorry": Teachers who feel sorry for a student's for being disabled were more likely to rush to "provide help," without having a child try something challenging on her or his own and, too, without figuring out how to teach that child to do something challenging on her or his own. Having too much sympathy can, it's suggested, be presumptive, as it may well involve a teacher feeling that a child who's "so disabled" just can't do some task (reading, talking, brushing her or his teeth, etc.), and "being nice" and doing it for her or him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our own experience with Charlie's education, teachers and therapists, it's been the case that teachers who've been willing to challenge him and be "harder"----and so seem "meaner," because the immediate response in Charlie was not necessarily to be too thrilled---have been the most effective. Further, they've been the teachers and therapists whose names Charlie has said over and over and who he's remembered the best. However demanding, stringent and, yes, "mean" these teachers and therapists may have seemed at the moment, in the long run, they've often been the most sympathetic and humane, because they knew that Charlie could learn; because they truly believed in him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meanness" is, perhaps, only a surface phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238444976130"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6f03b65648555db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Defining the Journalism vs. Blogging Debate, with a Science Reporting angle</title><published>2009-03-30T21:08:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T21:08:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/qX8ihVAIflE/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know I have been following the "&lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/03/26/flying_seminar.html" title=""&gt;death of newspapers&lt;/a&gt;" debate, as well as "&lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/01/21/berk_essy.html" title=""&gt;bloggers vs. journalists&lt;/a&gt;" debate, and "do we need science reporters" debate for a long time now. What I have found - and it is frustrating to watch - is that different people use different definitions for the same set of words and phrases. "News", "reporting", "media", "press", "journalism", "Web", "Internet", "blog", "citizen journalist", "newspapers", "communication", etc. are defined differently by different people. Usually they do not explicitly define the terms, but it is possible to grasp their definition from context. Sometimes, people use one definition in their initial article, but once the debate heats up, they switch the definitions. Some define terms too broadly, others too narrowly, depending on their own background, biases or agendas. Some make the error of using several of those terms interchangeably, where a clear distinction exists. Thus, in many of the debates, it is a conversation of the deaf - the opponents do not understand that they actually agree (or allies don't see that they actually disagree) because they do not use the terms the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is my attempt to clear up a lot of that mess, at least for myself, by coming up with my own definitions: the way I think of these terms. Please use the comments thread to point out where I am wrong, or offer better definitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is also a response to a whole slew of online discussions in the wake of &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/" title=""&gt;this Clay Shirky post&lt;/a&gt; - Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable, including some &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/17/ifYouDontLikeTheNews.html" title=""&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/19/theRebootOfJournalism.html" title=""&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, this post is also a response to the &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/43bd4680-1b8d-4ddf-0bce-a6044830014a/shameless-self-promotion-Science-Blogging-vs/" title=""&gt;big discussion&lt;/a&gt; we recently had in the aftermath of the &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; article about science journalism and science blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I will try to do is define some terms and try to find (and link to if possible - though checking through the links on &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/03/26/flying_seminar.html" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, as well checking what I "Like" on FriendFeed, following &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu" title=""&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, or digging through my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/media/" title=""&gt;Media&lt;/a&gt; category) examples of people using the term in the same way as well as in alternative ways. I will also try to explain my thinking; provide a historical context (and again, correct me when I am wrong as I am not a media historian); explain what is happening today and what a possible future may be (feel free to disagree); and finally see how science reporting is similar or different from the rest of reporting. Let's start....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking News&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="journalist.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/journalist.gif" width="440" height="331" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Something (Event A) happens at Time X. Nobody could have expected or predicted that A would happen at all, or at least that it would happen at the particular time X. It is a new data point. Not 'information' yet, just data. It may be interesting or important enough to notify the world that A happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;key to breaking news is speed&lt;/b&gt;. It needs to be relayed as close to Real Time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A plane just landed on Hudson"&lt;br&gt;
"A plane landed on Hudson, took pic with cellphone, see it here:"&lt;br&gt;
"A plane landed on Hudson, on ferry going to save people"&lt;br&gt;
"A plane landed on Hudson, I am on it, everyone alive"&lt;br&gt;
"I am a pilot. I just landed a plane on Hudson. Bird strike - both engines"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the above statements do? They answer just one of the canonical journalistic questions: What? Inevitably, such breaking news reports will contain answers to some other questions, e.g., Where? (Hudson), When? (look at time-stamps of the reports), perhaps Who? (pilot and passengers). It is too early to add answers to the questions How and Why. The premium is on speed, accuracy and fact-checking will have to come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice something? Each of the statements above is shorter than 140 characters. Perfectly possible to post on Twitter (or a &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/25/whyItMattersThatTwitterIsA.html" title=""&gt;twitter-like&lt;/a&gt; platform). From a mobile device. By eye-witnesses, not professional journalists (Note: some of them are paraphrases of &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Hudson" title=""&gt;actual twitter messages&lt;/a&gt;, others are hypotheticals I invented).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 12 minutes later, the &lt;b&gt;online&lt;/b&gt; media sources (AP, Reuters, CNN, etc.) will break the news as well. What info are they going with? What they read on Twitter, or perhaps they got some phone calls. It will take them some time to dispatch professional reporters to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the crews are on the scene, they will have text, audio and video done pretty quickly, so the breaking news can show up on radio and TV. Newspapers? You will read those stale news the next morning. Probably incomplete because it will miss all the new incoming information that happens between the dispatch is filed in the evening and the time you get to read your paper with your morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about accuracy? As the premium is on speed, accuracy check has to come later. How many times have you noticed breaking news on CNN saying there are 6 dead, then 30 minutes later changing that to 9 dead, then another hour later changing that to 15 dead, etc. The mainstream media also have to make corrections if their initial reports were inaccurate. There is nothing new about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a potential for abuse, e.g., hoaxes? Yes. The mainstream media has been taken in by hoaxes before, and will be again, and the subsequent accuracy check reveals this and the media retracts and apologizes. Nothing new there, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the questions of How and Why? That comes later and is not a part of "Breaking News", it is a part of "News Analysis". Who will provide those answers? Professional journalists will interview the officials (e.g., from the airline), read the official reports, interview participants (e.g., the pilot, passengers), and the eye-witnesses and will try to put together a more-or-less complete story about the Event A. Some will do this better than others. Some events are easier to report on than others due to, for instance, political sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/what_is_citizen_journalism.php" title=""&gt;Citizen Journalists&lt;/a&gt; do the same? Yes and No. The professional reporters will be able to enter a press briefing and interview the officials. This is more difficult for bloggers to do, but that is changing fast - bloggers are getting press passes more and more these days. On the other hand, an eye-witness will be more relaxed and open to a neighbor with a cell phone than with a reporter shoving his/her microphone in your face and shouting questions. When approached by the press, most people recoil, get all their red flags up, get very cautious what they are saying, and generally do not blurt out everything they really know or think. It is much harder for pros to get the information out of regular citizens, even if it is, for now, easier for them to get information out of officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when the bridge fell down in Minnesota about a year ago? Who did the best reporting? The &lt;a href="http://www.blanked-out.com/category/35w-bridge-collapse/" title=""&gt;guy who lives in the first house next to the bridge&lt;/a&gt;. He was there at the moment of the event. He ran down and took pictures. He talked to the passers-by and neighbors. Many knew him and trusted him. He got involved in the rescue and interviewed the people he rescued. And he posted all of that on his blog in as close to Real Time as was humanely possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the local media do in comparison? Quite poorly. It took them time to get there, it took them time to gather the facts, they could not get honest, personal accounts from eye-witnesses and victims who viewed them with suspicion. It took them even more time to find more information and put together their stories. And then they abandoned the story, while the rescue was still going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is that blogger a journalist? Yes and No. He was, for a time, an Accidental Journalist. He just happened to be there at the right time and right place and he did his civic duty to find information and report it. He never asked for money for doing it (although, if I remember correctly, readers asked him to put up a PayPal button so they could financially reward him for his service) - he felt it was his obligation as he could do a more thorough job than the pros at this particular story. Did it make him want to become a journalist? I don't know, but I guess not [oops - I guess &lt;a href="http://www.blanked-out.com/2008/01/30/give-up-on-the-mainstream-media/" title=""&gt;he does&lt;/a&gt;!]. I think he went back afterwards to his own life, blogging whatever he wanted to blog about, probably satisfied that he did his citizen's job well and was widely recognized for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for many other news events. For instance, a guy tweeted from the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Boulder" title=""&gt;Boulder&lt;/a&gt; airplane accident (12 minutes before any other news source had anything out) a couple of months ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about news in other countries? How about, for instance, the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Mumbai" title=""&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; terrorist attack? Lots of eye-witnesses posted on Twitter frantically for a couple of weeks. They were all Accidental Journalists. Do you "trust" each and every individual and each and every tweet? No, but when you look at the entire collection, yes, a pattern emerges, and you can trust them as a group, quite obviously. So, why many journos and readers did not trust them? And waited patiently for US/UK media to send their pros to the scene? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a mix of ethnocentrism, racism and anti-democratic sentiments that many still, unfortunately, harbor. There is no reason to trust NYT and WaPo reporters better than the Indian twitterers. But, hey, they are not trained in the NYT newsroom, and they are Indian - ergo, not to be trusted. Excuse: they are biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bias? What bias - all they did was input the data: what, where, when. They did not write 1000-word essays, just information. Also, unlike the Western journalists that later arrived on the scene, the locals were much more familiar with the context: the map of the city, the history, the players, the politics of it all, which made them much more efficient news gatherers as they knew where to go, who to talk to, what to ask and what to do. They were far better informed than the foreign reporters, and thus I trusted them much more than the foreign reporters. In subsequent News Analysis, both the locals and foreign experts could write longer pieces and that is where, perhaps, bias of both sources could show up. But not at the Breaking News stage yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my definition of Breaking News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Informing the world about novel, unpredicted data about the world in as close to Real Time as possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional journalists are almost never going to personally witness the events as they happen (they can't be everywhere at all times - not enough of them for this to be so). Eye-witnesses are those who will break the news (and pros can work with those data later, for more in-depth coverage). Are we there yet? No, but getting close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the Hudson airplane event again, but let's say it happens five or ten years from now in the future. Let's say there are 100 people on board. All 100, in that future, will have cell-phones with online access and will be familiar, comfortable and fluent in the use of microblogging services, just like most people today are fluent with using a phone. The plane crashes. 10 are too hurt to do anything. 20 are too scared to think straight. 55 pull out their cellphones and tweet "holy cow - I was just in a plane accident". Not too informative, but the sheer numbers help spread the news virally faster. The remaining 15 have enough presence of mind and enough understanding of what they are supposed to do, they will tweet much more information. "Crashed on Hudson, nobody dead, 10 hurt", "Heard explosion, both engines on fire before the crash", "Saw flock of ducks around the wings just before the accident", etc. When you take &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/15/canTwitterSaveTheNews.html" title=""&gt;the total output&lt;/a&gt; of all of them - that is Breaking News. &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/21/theFutureNewsSystemOfTheWo.html" title=""&gt;Sufficient information&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/25/isTwitterANewsSystem.html" title=""&gt;put pieces together&lt;/a&gt; in real time. Accidental Journalists, who will afterwards go back to their normal lives. Unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science? What would be the equivalent for science journalism? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A famous scientist dies (that is kind-a meta-science, not science itself). An 'Eureka' moment from someone's lab or from the field. Creationists just introduced another stealth legislation to wedge religion into science classes. The last individual of a species dies in a zoo. An observatory detects an asteroid hurling towards Earth. Mars Rover detects water. A revolutionary discovery announced at a hastily-arranged press conference. That's about it. Again, it is just a data-point, in Real Time, something that every citizen involved or eye-witnessing can competently report: What, Where, When.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reporting News&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="journalist2.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/journalist2.gif" width="252" height="308" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;What is the difference between Breaking News and Reporting News? I think an important difference is in predictability. If we know that something newsworthy will happen at a particular time and place, we can have whatever infrastructure and equipment is needed in place to capture and broadcast that information in real time. We can send camera crews and reporters to a football game or horse races, or to a meeting of the City Council, or to Congress when it is in session, or to New Orleans as Katrina is approaching, or to an event which started as 'breaking news' but is now 'ongoing news' (think of the Tsunami in Indonesia a couple of years ago). We can even automate some of that stuff, e.g,. weather, stock market ticker-tape, Racing Form, just off the top of my head. Do we need the Turing test? Who cares, as long as the data are made readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we'll get from there is a video or audio of the event. And a quick summary report. Traditional media of all kinds: newspapers, radio, TV have an advantage here, at this point in history, over any kind of non-traditional journalists due to infrastructure - they have the equipment, they have the channels, they have enormous audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Internet kills the traditional media is in the lack of limits. Radio or TV will have a 2-minute summary, a newspaper will have a predetermined amount of space for it. This will tell you briefly What, Who, Where, When, How and perhaps even a little bit of Why, but cannot, by definition tell the whole story. If you are not interested, this is enough for you. If you are interested, or if you are suspicious of the source, you are left hanging and unsatisfied. But online, that short summary will provide a link to something that no other medium can afford to have: the entire transcript of the session, the entire video of the whole football game, full uncut interviews instead of brief quotes, further links to additional relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traditional media are good and fast at quickly relaying the summaries of the news, the Web can provide a full record of the event far beyond the summary and keep it there, as a record, forever, when all the tapes and paper are already rotten and gone. Smart traditional media are already starting to do exactly that - the radio or TV program or the newspaper are just the vehicles that deliver the audience to the website where the full information can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is the Election here in the USA. On November 4th, you can watch the pundits blabber on CNN, but what CNN provided that was really useful was their website where every result of every race in every state, county and precinct was reported as soon as the data became available. There were several such websites on that day, and they were much more useful than any broadcast. Newspapers? Well, a lot of people bought the papers next morning because they wanted to have a cover with a big Obama picture on it as a souvenir. Nobody actually learned the result from the papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as bloggers (those who are interested and ambitious about it) are more and more treated as journalists, given press passes and given journalistic privileges, some of them will be able to report news just as well as the traditional media, and since they do not have the space and time limits of radio, TV and papers, they can make both their summaries and their complete reports as short or as long as they want, with as much supporting documentation as they can find, and the audience will pick and choose what to read according to their own levels of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as many newspapers go belly up, there will be a vaccuum on local reporting. How will that vaccuum get filled, who will report from the City Council meetings? Well, every community will solve that problem differently: some will find a way to pay a blogger or two to do it. Others will require all sessions to be taped and full videos, full transcripts and full texts of documents be placed online immediately after the session is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my definition of Reporting News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Informing the world about novel, yet predictable data about the world in as close to Real Time as possible, using either personal or automated reporting systems.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days a predictable event is a publication of a paper. It may come with a press release. It can be covered as news. Science reporters know exactly which journal publishes on which day of the week, subscribe to e-mail announcements, get PDFs in advance, and write short reports that are released at the time embargo is lifted. Fine. Very traditional. It is similar with conferences, where talks can be reported on. Announcing the Nobel Prize winners is another example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=448" title=""&gt;new trends in science&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new online technologies, allow for something different: data become available for broadcast as soon as they are produced. Folks in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/video_of_the_open_science_pane.php" title=""&gt;Open Notebook Science&lt;/a&gt; movement are posting all of their data online as soon as the data are generated. The information is not just What, but also How (materials and methods), the time-stamps tells us When, the owner of the site is the Who, and the lab where the data originated is the Where. No need to do any Why yet (apart from the initial motivation to do the experiment to begin with - the stated hypothesis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those same folks are now working on ways to automate the process. Instead of typing the new data into the wiki in the evening, they are coaxing their laboratory equipment to automatically post the data on the Web. Likewise, the Mars Rover was &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix" title=""&gt;tweeting from Mars&lt;/a&gt;. That is scientists broadcasting data to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/call_for_articles_user-led_sci.php" title=""&gt;citizen scientists&lt;/a&gt;" do the same. &lt;a href="http://www.birdsource.org/" title=""&gt;Christmas bird watch&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/08/inaturalist_rocks.php" title=""&gt;Species location and identification&lt;/a&gt;? Plant &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/science_crowdsourcing_-_ecolog.php" title=""&gt;phenology&lt;/a&gt; data? The &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyzoo.org/" title=""&gt;Galaxy Zoo&lt;/a&gt; project? Live-blogging data &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_2pm.php" title=""&gt;from the field&lt;/a&gt; research? All the data go online in real time. The NC fishermen will &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/an_innovative_use_of_twitter_m.php" title=""&gt;tweet their catch in real time&lt;/a&gt;. Just 'data'. Not 'information' yet.  Certainly not analysis yet. That's News Reporting. Straight from the horse's mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;News Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="journalist3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/journalist3.jpg" width="336" height="408" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now we are getting to a place where being in the right place at the right time is not enough. Knowledge, expertise, and ability to find and parse through sources, becomes important. News are data. News analysis is information - 'data made meaningful'. Breaking News and Reporting News just provide the raw data - News Analysis connects the dots, places the new data-set into the context of other related data-sets, and provides historical, philosophical, theoretical, methodological, economic, political, sociological, etc, contexts. It also tries to answer the hardest of the canonical questions of journalism: Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a place where access to additional sources of information is important. The sources of information are: a) documents, and b) people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents, which formerly had to be dug up in libraries or various repositories, necessitating travel (which costs) or permission (which journalists could get using their employers' brand names), are now for the most part freely available online. Full transcripts of interviews, full videos of events, full texts of pieces of legislation - all of this is now easily found on the Web and will be even more so in the near future. Thus, anyone who has the time and passion and expertise to dig out all the information and put it all together, can do so. Who do you trust on economics more: an economist or a journalist? Who has the proper training, knowledge, experience and expertise and is less likely to fall for the sweet-talking, nonsense-speaking PR shills for the special interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are tougher. Pro journalists nurture special relationships with the people in power. They have access to them that you and I don't (yet). Thus, people in power are more likely to give interviews to pros than to amateurs. There are pros and cons to this, of course. The intimate relationship biases the reporter - just look at The Village in D.C., totally corrupted by the PR that politicos push on them at all those cocktail parties, and thus oblivious to any other views, including the views of most regular people. And as the transparency is the new motto in D.C. and more and more people in power are themselves present online, it is gradually becoming easier for all of us to gain access even to the most reclusive and the most powerful people. Just give it a few more years - the non-responsive will not get re-elected so easily any more (it's already happening at the local level - if you want to get elected here in Orange County, you better show up at &lt;a href="http://orangepolitics.org/" title=""&gt;Orange Politics&lt;/a&gt; blog, answer questions, and moreover answer the question in a satisfactory way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I noted above, an amateur journalist will get a much more honest response from a regular person who is suspicious of the corporate media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the greatest advantage of the Web, no matter if the article is written by a professional journalist or an amateur with expertise in the topic as opposed as in journalism, is space. Radio will give you at most an hour for such a big story, if you are very lucky to be picked by editors to say it. Television is even more competitive and hour-long stories are very rare. If you look at New York Times (or any other big daily paper), such an in-depth story of the requiered length happens mainly once a week in the Sunday Magazine - rarely outside of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the News Analysis stories get cut in length and parade as news reporting. Instead of complete interviews, you get brief quotes. Now, think about it for a minute. You talk to a reporter for an hour. It is because what you have to say requires an hour to explain. You see yourself quoted the next day in the newspapers. Even if the quote is verbatim, it is nonetheless a misquote, or a 'quote out of context' because it lacks all of the other stuff you said before and after that sentence - all the context and background and caveats and examples are gone. Even if your quote is verbatim, it may lead the reader to assume that you meant opposite of what you really meant. Or at least, something tangential and certainly not the main point you really wanted to hammer home (for instance, even if &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html" title=""&gt;those quotes are verbatim and I really said that&lt;/a&gt;, this was not what my Main Take Home Message for this article was, not even close).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online, there are no limits to length. Your story will be as short or as long as it needs to be. When you quote someone, you, right there and then, link to the complete transcript of the interview so the people can go and find the context for themselves and check if you quoted them correctly. You link to all the relevant documents so people can check if you cited them correctly. The ethic of the hyperlink that you use in your online article will always trump the articles by the best and most ethical professional journalists just because of space limitations - their analysis has to be incomplete and they cannot know what pieces of information can be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing News Analysis takes time and effort. Not everyone has the time required and not everyone has the motivation to do this. But if you look around the blogosphere, it becomes obvious that many people find time and have the motivation to do this on a regular basis. If paid, even more of them would do it even more regularly (I know I would). Plus, unlike the journalists, they have the required expertise in the topic, which makes them more reliable and trustworthy than the journalists (or at least most journalists - some got good by covering the topic for decades, an unusual and unofficial way to get an informal 'social equivalent' of a PhD on the topic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As traditional media goes bankrupt and journalists are laid off, some will start doing this online as freelancers. Some bloggers will continue doing this. The line between journalism and blogging will become even more fuzzy. And some traditional media will figure out how to do journalism online and allow their paid journalists to adopt the online form and use the unlimited space, time and hyperlinking that makes online journalism better than the one done on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my definition of News Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turning a data-set into Information by connecting it to other related data-sets and providing meaningful context and explanation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ur-example of this is the scientific paper itself: Who, Where and When (authors, affiliations, publication date), Why (Introduction), How (Materials and Methods), What (title, abstract, Results, statistics, graphs, complete data-sets and supplementary data), Context and Analysis (Discussion) and relationship to related data-sets (List of References).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the data and the context and the analysis are presented by the authors of the data-set themselves, which raises concerns about objectivity. Which is why we insist on having the manuscript pass peer-review and editorial decision to publish in a reputable scientific journal. But as more people move to real-time Open Notebook Science, as talks and posters presented at (formerly assumed to be closed to a small circle) conferences become liveblogged, and as the process of publication become both &lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/07/02/Jcom0702(2008)C01/Jcom0702(2008)C02/" title=""&gt;more dynamic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/on_my_last_scientific_paper_i.php" title=""&gt;more collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, the peer-review itself will have to become more dynamic and collaborative. Instead of 2-3 people doing it at one point before the publication, now many people will keep doing it throughout the process of publication and afterwards, leaving their commentary/review attached to the paper itself forever. Additional review will happen outside of the paper itself, in an &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/27/blog-coverage-and-the-pick-of-the-month/" title=""&gt;outer circle of the ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;: in the media, almost all of it in the online media, aka blogs, and trackbacked to the paper itself for easy discovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this level of communication, speaking good English is nice, but real expertise in that area of science is far more important. Thus, very rarely will this kind of analysis be done by people who are primarily journalists (unless they, over the decades of reporting on that one area of science, have become as expert as working scientists are on that topic - a very rare occasion). This will be done almost entirely by scientists (in the broader sense of the term - not just currently active researchers, but all who are trained in science irrespective of their current job description).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science bloggers may not cover every new paper, or even every new hot paper, and may not care about timeliness of writing in time for the embargo-lift (I know how hard it is to get them to do it immediately!), but when they write about a study, they will &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/" title=""&gt;write kick-ass stuff&lt;/a&gt; that almost all journalists can only dream of doing. And more importantly, they will rarely focus only on that one paper - they are much more likely to provide a deeper context for it as they already know the relevant literature: they don't need to dig for it for the first time today. And if they get a fact wrong, the commenters, themselves mainly scientists, will be quick to point that out in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today we have a situation in which authors write papers which get published months or years after the data have been gathered. Their institutions write press releases. Science reporters, those who still have jobs in this economy, are so pressed for time covering so many stories simultaneously, they just regurgitate the press releases. Then bloggers jump on them for sensationalism and for the lack of accuracy, and for missing out the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, with jobs in science being so scarce, many people with science degrees, including many with PhDs will want to change their career paths. Instead of doing research, or teaching high-school, they may want to do science journalism. But there are no jobs in traditional media for this - science journalists are getting fired left and right! Well, they can get hired by universities and write press releases, which will thus become better than what we are used to seeing now. Or they can freelance. Or start science blogs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a new world - it used to be you apply to jobs and once you are hired you start to work. Today, you start working for free and hope that it is good. You accumulate a portfolio that you can show when you apply for jobs. You develop a good reputation that brings you job offers out of the blue. It is nerve-wrecking, but if you are good, something good will happen to you as people will not allow good stuff to remain unrewarded for too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/oa/index.html" title=""&gt;Open Access&lt;/a&gt; (and importantly, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/06/historical_oa.php" title=""&gt;Historical Open Access&lt;/a&gt;), with Open Notebook Science, with scientists writing press releases, with scientists writing blogs, and with all those getting connected by hyperlinks, the audience will get everything: science reporting from authors directly, both in formal (journal papers) and informal (blogs) settings AND via intermediaries who are also trained in science. That kind of information combo can be trusted. A quick hyping report in a newspaper, radio or TV cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investigative Reporting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="DANGERexpectations.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/DANGERexpectations.jpg" width="249" height="241" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is what the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22journalistic+curmudgeons%22&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a" title=""&gt;curmudgeons&lt;/a&gt; like to say - bloggers can't do investigative reporting. Really? But what is it? Going to a press conference and asking Obama a gotcha question is not reporting - it is manufacturing news. You are not trying to find out what Obama is planning or doing or saying, but what he says in response to your question. That's news? No, without your question, he would not have said anything - you made the news by asking, and reporting his answer is not reporting the news, and certainly not investigative reporting. You inserted yourself into the world and caused news ("what he said") to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigative reporting is uncovering data and information that does not want to be uncovered. Hmm, sounds like a definition, so here it is italicized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Investigative reporting is uncovering data and information that does not want to be uncovered.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hidden, often because someone is purposefully hiding it, i.e., suppresing it and does not want the world to know. That's tough to do. Go out and ask someone where one can buy a physical newspaper in your town. Then go and buy one. Look at every page. &lt;a href="http://xark.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/02/whos-watching-the-watchdogs.html" title=""&gt;How many pieces of investigative reporting did you find&lt;/a&gt; - information that someone tried to suppress but the brave reporter uncovered? If you find one on any given day, your local newspaper is really, really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it happens. Pulitzers are given for a reason to worthy investigative reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how about blogs? Firedoglake crew did the investigative reporting on the entire Valerie Plame outing and Skooter Libby trial. They dug up documents. They interviewed people. They sat in court every second of the proceedings. They posted bried summaries for people who had just a passing, superficial interest in the story. They posted detailed analyses. They posted lengthy interviews. They posted entire documents. They posted legal analysis (as some of them are lawyers). The entire traditional media on the planet, when put together, did not cover the case as much and as well as that one little blog. And they would have covered even less if they were not pushed and shamed by Firedoglake to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to remind you of Talking Points Memo? &lt;a href="http://www.themudflats.net/" title=""&gt;Mudflats&lt;/a&gt; digging up the backstory on Sarah Palin? The Durham bloggers and the Lacrosse case? And many, many more. Police beat is tough to do for non-professionals, yet bloggers have been known to uncover and bring to life issues like corruption in their police departments, or cases of anwarranted use of force and abuse by officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whose investigative reporting led to resignation of Deutch, the Bush's NASA censor? &lt;a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/nasa-science-censor-resigns.html" title=""&gt;Nick Anthis&lt;/a&gt;, a (then) small blogger (who also later reported on the Animal Rights demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in Oxford in great detail as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who blew up the case of plagiarism in dinosaur palaenthology, the so-calles Aetogate? A &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=pub-5976931228913298&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A13%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&amp;amp;adkw=AELymgUEzy1KrQ0DW6j5c_BfJ7ch69HiCoAqJLKfqYtZWXRBJsLeGQvXiSDkQNW-ennKi1OuW7xxrhYTmMqvDSNhed39eAkOZqliTAxit19doCXd-fWXAFhqwBz6BT5U8jkbVDzQ2JrzOg17kGyhxBYLqeaqE09S5z9ACEVV7tJ8HoaN96V8DQTx8VreQ0N7jzrd3MHHOkidMKSnupludH29WFTXlvRCFw&amp;amp;boostcse=0&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;q=aetogate&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0" title=""&gt;bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who blew up, skewered and castrated the PRISM, the astroturf organization designed to lobby the Senate against the NIH Open Access bill? A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/this_prism_does_not_turn_white.php" title=""&gt;bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. The bill passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/tripoli_6/" title=""&gt;Tripoli 6&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who pounced on George Will and WaPo when he trotted out the long-debunked lie about global warming? And forced them to squirm, and respond, and publish two counter-editorials? A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/02/the_buzz_facts_as_cold_and_har.php" title=""&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/the-george-will-on-ice-affair/" title=""&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who dug up all the information, including the most incriminating key evidence against Creationists that was used at the Dover trial? A bunch of &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/" title=""&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on, and so on, this was just scratching the surface with the most famous stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a person is slighted, or detects some unfairness of foul play, that person is highly motivated to dig deeper and uncover the truth. In earlier times, this required finding and persuading a reporter to do it for you. Today, you can do it yourself and, by recruiting hundreds of other bloggers to your cause, raise enough of a stink that the corporate media cannot ignore the story any more and is forced to report it. Even if that means they have to report on something outside of their '&lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/01/12/atomization.html" title=""&gt;sphere&lt;/a&gt;' of "what is considered normal", and thus helping, against their best instincts, to &lt;a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2007/02/14/thank-you-richard-dawkins/" title=""&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.correntewire.com/the_overton_window_illustrated" title=""&gt;Overton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008820.html" title=""&gt;Window&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=7504" title=""&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/14/104852/233" title=""&gt;direction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/5/9/205251/2950" title=""&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/04/framing_science_the_dialogue_o.php" title=""&gt;reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opinion, Entertainment, Storytelling, etc.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four aspects of journalism above - Breaking News, Reporting News, News Analysis and Investigative Reporting - are often considered to be 'journalism proper'. As we saw above, the Web is the best medium for all four due to speed, hyperlinks and limitless space. All four can be and have been done by non-professionals. For some, such non-professionals are already demonstrating they are better. For others, the traditional media still has the upper hand to some extent, though this is changing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody says that everybody can do it or wants to do it or will do it, but it shows that professional journalistic training is not a necessary pre-requisite for doing it right. It only says something about the medium, not the people or training. Amateurs, by and large, do not have access to the newspapers, radio and television. But both professionals and amateurs have access to the Web, and both can potentially do all four types of journalism online and do it correctly. Amateurs and professionals are on equal footing here and their work and work alone will determine who will gather a following by building trust with the audience, and who will have to find a different day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the above four are not the only parts of journalism, if one thinks of it a little broader. In many minds, journalism is "everything that shows up in newspapers, on the radio, on TV, and online". Not just news. Also ads, obituaries, sports, nice pictures, drawings and cartoons and comic strips, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/storyblogging_aidsblogging_and.php" title=""&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt;, poems, opinion-pieces, crossword puzzles, quiz shows, commercials, travelogues, diaries, funny videos and so on, and so on....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With paper, radio and TV, editors decide what goes in. With the Internet, everything gets published and the audience fliters the content, buries the bad and promotes the good, so, at least in theory, the best stuff, after a while, rises to the top and becomes very, very "famous". The technology-based and people-based filters that do this are still imperfect but are in the process of constant tweaking and improvement. Google search is the best known of the technological filters. There are others. For people-based filters, check out &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_315.php" title=""&gt;Blog Carnivals&lt;/a&gt;. For science, there are Google Scholar, CiteULike and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/latest_journal_ranking_in_the.php" title=""&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt;. We are all Editor now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as &lt;a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Digby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/" title=""&gt;Glenn Greenwald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandagon.net/" title=""&gt;Amanda Marcotte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Melissa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/" title=""&gt;Hilzoy&lt;/a&gt; write better op-eds - in every sense of the term: better use of English, better thinking, more accurate facts - than David Brooks or Maureen Dowd or George Will, soon there will be no reason to pay Brooks or Dowd or Will to produce stuff that most people don't read and others read for laughs. It is a big cost for the NYT, with nothing to show for it but embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for other stuff: stories, comic strips, art....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already killed the music industry, it is now killing the newspaper as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journalism is EVERYTHING that appears in the media.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in this sense, we are all journalists. Even if we never break news or do investigative reporting, if we write poetry on our blogs, we are journalists. And the world is our editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in this sense, science bloggers are all science journalists as well. We disseminate cool educational videos, announcements of interesting lectures and meetings, we write opinion pieces, we write educational pieces (e.g., the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2008/12/basic_concepts_in_science_a_li_1.php" title=""&gt;Basics&lt;/a&gt;), we dispel the myths of anti-social dorky stereotypes of scientists by writing personal stories, we connect science to art, literature, politics and culture, and we do something uniquely useful by discussing the trials and tribulations of career paths in science. And we are fun. So people keep coming back for more. Thank you ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspapers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspaper is a bunch of loose pieces of paper with stuff printed on them. It is one of many ways to deliver various kinds of content, including news. It is not the one and only, or even the best &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=a4e2aafc-cc92-4e79-90d1-db3946a6d119" title=""&gt;'defender of Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspapers &lt;b&gt;does not equal&lt;/b&gt; news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="past-present-future.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/past-present-future.jpg" width="320" height="300" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Breaking news, reporting news, news analysis, investigative reporting, opinion, storytelling, entertainment, art, sports results, scientific data, advertising - none of that inherently HAS to be printed on paper. All of that can be done and is done daily on the radio, on TV and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper, ink, printing presses, trucks....all of that is extremely expensive. And that technology is far too slow for the 21st century. And the limited real-estate on the paper forces a system in which content to be printed has to be chosen in advance - by editors - and chopped down to size - by editors - before it sees the light of day, several hours after it ceased to be news. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper has a very limited scope to deliver content in comparison to technologies that arrived later. Radio and TV are likewise constrained by time. Internet has no space or time constraints, thus there is no need for any editors to make choices as to what goes and what doesn't, and there is no need for longer pieces to get cut shorter by editors either (heck, I'd love to have an editor to fix my typos, bad grammar, wrong punctuation, and suggest improvements in style, as long as my content remains unbutchered and I have a final say what goes online in the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional media, all the filtering is done by editors before the transmission. In online media, all the filtering is done by a collective editorial choice of the readership, after the transmission. In online media, there are no length limits, thus a journalist is at freedom to include all the relevant information. Additional information is linked to. Feedback is instant, in the comments. The best pieces rise to the top, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, I need to be fair. Just like there are many different kinds of blogs, so there are many different kinds of newpapers. If you are in Manhattan right now, go outside and look at the newspaper stand down the street. What do you see? Just New York Times? No, there will be that other rightwingnutospheric rag, the New York Post, there as well. There will be also many other newspapers, with narrower niches, covering art, or underground music scene, or Real Estate listings. And then there are magazines  - weekly or monthly or quarterly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that NYTimes also once published their first ever copy, at the time when nobody suspected they would become the "newspaper of record".  Many New York City newspapers have come and gone over the decades, and who could have guessed that out of all of them it would be the New York Times to survive this long?! And it's not even that good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not in Manhattan, go out and buy USA Today and your local metro. Take a good look at both. Which one do you like better? Which one of the two do you think will survive? Which one of the two you wish will survive? I bet that, almost everywhere in the USA you may be (and I guess there are equivalent examples in other countries), the answer to all those questions is: USA Today. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USA Today will have LOTS of news - something for everyone every day. It has excellent reporters and journalists and op-ed writers. There is, in each day's issue, quality content that you cannot find anywhere else. And furthermore, if the brevity of an article frustrates you, the paper tells you to go to their website. There, you will not just find the copy+paste of the printed article. You will also find more information, and often links to additional information. They are not perfect, but they are slowly getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, your local metro will consist mostly of advertising, AP stories, syndicated columnists and comic strips, horoscope, a local mouthbreathing op-ed writer spouting rushlimbaughisms and, if you are lucky, a reprint of a two-days-old Krugman editorial. How many locally produced news? Very little. Reports from the meetings of the City Council or School Board? Nope. Investigative reporting? Zero. I hope you &lt;a href="http://loudpaper.typepad.com/loudpaper/2009/03/in.html" title=""&gt;have a birdcage&lt;/a&gt; that needs lining or own a fish store that needs cheap wrapping paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you live in a place like Carrboro, NC? You will go out and pick, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/" title=""&gt;Carrboro Citizen&lt;/a&gt;. Two years old. Free to pick up anywhere. Increasing their print volume every week. Their problem? So many people outside Carrboro - in Chapel Hill, greater Orange County and northern Chatham County want not just to read it but also for the Citizen to cover their areas. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/carrboro_citizen_a_model_for_t.php" title=""&gt;Why are&lt;/a&gt; they &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/carrboro_citizen_-_the_hyperlo.php" title=""&gt;so successful&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: it is web-to-print. Pieces written by locals, or &lt;a href="http://carrborocommons.org/" title=""&gt;by UNC students&lt;/a&gt;, are posted online, get comments, and then are edited for printing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: it is hyperlocal, containing advertising for local businesses and covering stories of local interest, including those pesky City Council and School Board meetings - stuff that cannot be found anywhere else in print or on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third: it does not pretend to be &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair and balanced&amp;quot; - it cares about truth and reality, not the he-said-she-said Broderian journalism. They write it as they see it, and they see it as they uncover the facts. So, if reality has a liberal bias, so be it. After all, Carrboro was one of the few places in which Kucinich won the primaries in 2004, so nobody here complains about liberal bias. A similar paper in a conservative town would probably have a conservative bias, and that is fine (let them live in delusions, I guess). You can disagree, but you cannot complain about dishonesty, or bias or hidden agendas, because nothing is hidden. And that is so refreshing after years of rage-inspiring so-called journalism of the other local papers, e.g., Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such newspapers - &lt;a href="http://jimbuie.blogs.com/journal/2009/03/future-of-newspapers-local-local-local-weeklies.html" title=""&gt;hyperlocal&lt;/a&gt;, community (or even family, club, team, organization) newspapers - will survive. The big, international, good papers like USA Today will survive by becoming "table of contents" for what they offer on their websites. The chain-owned metros will die. And good riddance because they have quit doing quality journalism a long time ago. Not because the reporters were bad, or even because their editors were biased, but because the owners made every wrong move in the book business-wise: cutting away what was unique and locally relevant, while keeping copy+paste syndicated stuff that everyone can find online in a thousand copies. Why would anyone ever pay for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the scientific journals and the popular science magazines are &lt;a href="http://liveserials.blogspot.com/2009/03/2020-publishing-odyssey.html" title=""&gt;facing a business crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The scientific journals are saving themselves by going fully online (and will probably, more and more, completely abandon the print editions) and by going Open Access (as libraries cannot afford their subscription rates any more). Those who are digging in their heels will go extinct. Just like the most heard-headed newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular science magazines are in a different kind of trouble. More and more, people can go directly to the primary sources for information as they become freely available online. More and more, their audience gets captured by science blogs which are both more fun and elicit greater respect, as they are written by scientists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/graham_lawton_was_wrong.php" title=""&gt;who turn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/21/the-new-scientist-has-no-shame-again/" title=""&gt;sensationalism&lt;/a&gt;, like The New Scientist, will lose their last customers quickly and will go under. Those that are trying to improve the quality of their magazine, like the &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/" title=""&gt;American Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, hiring the PhDs in science who want to switch to journalism, producing fascinating, scientifically accurate stories that require much more time and effort than your average science blogger is willing to put into a post, getting top class artists to illustrate their stories, providing uniquely good book reviews or news that cannot be found elsewhere, and release all of their articles online soon after the print edition goes out, will persist for a while longer. Those who do science with a twist, like &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/" title=""&gt;Seed Magazine&lt;/a&gt; connects science to culture, art and politics, will also persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science reporting in newspapers? Dead. Because the newspapers are dead. The few mega-big papers that survive &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php" title=""&gt;will have good science coverage&lt;/a&gt; by a stable of excellent freelance journalists, each covering a different area of science and bringing in decades of expertise on the topic. The hyperlocals, if they have a scientific community locally (as the Triangle does), will have good locally-relevant science coverage. Otherwise, they will have none. Most science beat reporters will, like their colleagues covering other beats, have to find new jobs. It hurts, but it is a fact of life. There is no going back now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blogs, bloggers and blogging&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/what_is_a_science_blog.php" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/blog_is_software.php" title=""&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/introducing_the_replacements.php" title=""&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/09/if_blogging_had_no_ethics_blog.php" title=""&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blog is software.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers are people who use blogging software. Blogging is using the blogging software. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://failatlife.blogspot.com/2009/03/blegh.html" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/090329.jpg" width="391" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bloggers are not alien invaders from outer space. Bloggers are humans, citizens, silent majority that never had a voice until now. Bloggers are former and usually current consumers of the media. And re-producers of the media (yup, those guys that drive the traffic to your sites). And commenters on the media (guys who keep you honest and make you better if you are open-minded enough to listen). As well as producers of the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When journalistic curmudgeons want to denigrate bloggers, they point to the blogs containing LOLcats and teenage angst. They conveniently forget &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/" title=""&gt;Talking Point Memo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" title=""&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://firedoglake.com/" title=""&gt;Firedoglake&lt;/a&gt;, Scienceblogs.com, or for that matter &lt;a href="http://slate.com/" title=""&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/" title=""&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200801u/atlantic-blogs" title=""&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not what you use, but how you use it. 90% of everything on blogs is crap. 90% of everything in newspapers is also crap. So goes for the radio and TV. If you complain that we should not point out the worst of the newspapers and focus on the best instead, then please reciprocate: point to the best of blogs, not the worst. Then perhaps we can have a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same goes for microblogging services like &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/30/plos-one-on-twitter-and-friendfeed/" title=""&gt;Twitter and FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;, or social networking sites &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php" title=""&gt;like Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. If all you see is boring stuff, you are following the wrong people. If you do not like Livecasting ("what I had for breakfast") which is actually an important aspect of human communication, then start following people who do &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/03/on-twitter-mind.html" title=""&gt;Mindcasting&lt;/a&gt; instead and you will get more than you bargained for in terms of intellectual nourishment and uncomfortable thought-provocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how do you find quality blogs? Well, how did you find quality newspapers? Someone told you, perhaps your parents when you were a child (or you just saw which newspaper came to your home every morning). Then you checked it out. Then you read it for a while and made up your own mind. You can do the same with blogs. Why do you need instant gratification - do your work and you will find excellent blogs that trounce traditional media in every way. Don't just sit around and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_shock_value_of_science_blo.php" title=""&gt;complain how many blogs there are and how all of them must be bad&lt;/a&gt;, but you will not waste your time finding out if you are correct about it or not. That's lazy and dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best blogs out there are now becoming true New Media establishments, paying their bloggers to do "real journalism", including investigative reporting, getting their bloggers press badges for important events (e.g., party conventions in election years). &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/" title=""&gt;TPM&lt;/a&gt; is hiring. Huffington Post &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/03/30/huffpost_fnd.html" title=""&gt;just got a nice sum of money&lt;/a&gt; to do &lt;a href="http://www.metaprinter.com/2009/03/what-would-jay-rosen-do-huffington-post-taps-rosen-as-senior-advisor/" title=""&gt;exactly that&lt;/a&gt; - I hope they will ditch their Chopras and Kennedys and other nutcases and do the same for the quality of their science/health reporting which is atrocious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://xark.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/03/news-futures-a-whats-next-overview.html" title=""&gt;newspapers are dying&lt;/a&gt;, they leave a vacuum. Most places either have an existing blog, or immediately start a new one, to replace the vanished newspaper. The medium is different, more conducive to quality journalism than any of the previous communication channels, but also requires much fewer people to get the job done. It will be different than the newspaper it replaces. It will try to fulfill the needs of the community that the newspaper did, but also fulfill the needs of the community that the newspaper never could do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll all be watching those valiant new efforts. Something will come out of them. A single business model? No, of course not - as many business models as there are communities. Some will work better than others, and some will work better in some places than in other places. No need to have an expectation that a single business model will win and be adopted by all. After all, the newspapers never had a single universal business model themselves, so why expect anything else from the New Media?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a newspaper folds, many people lose their jobs. And it hurts. And in this economy, it is hard for them to find other jobs. Typesetters, printers, packers, truck drivers will have to find new lines of work. Editors, technical editors, copy editors, accountants, lawyers, artists, and yes, reporters, will have to find new jobs. What took thousands of people to produce - a newspaper - now takes a dozen people, and they can do the job better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of pain going around. But it is not the fault of bloggers, or of Blogspot, Wordpress and MoveableType. It is these that will do the journalism in the future, and some of the former newspaper journalists will find jobs in the online media if they are open minded and willing to learn how to &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2008/09/18/because_we_have.html" title=""&gt;adopt to the new medium&lt;/a&gt;. Quality journalism will survive, in this medium or another, but will require fewer &lt;b&gt;paid professionals&lt;/b&gt; to do so. A core professional stuff, plus crowdsourcing, will produce news and entertainment and everything in-between. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the old journos will suffer in the meantime. And I feel for them. Most of them are good people, and good at what they do. They get flack from readers when some editor slaps a silly headline on top of their work, or when some editor cuts the key paragraph out of the article, or some editor rewrites the article beyond recognition. Many have learned to suffer in silence about such indignities in order to save their jobs. They have learned to play the game. Many of them will feel relieved - oh such a sense of freedom, finally! - when they move online and adapt to its practices. And they will produce great journalism, many of them for the first time in their lives. It is unfortunate that so few of them can get paid to do it. Just an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the whole "bloggers will replace journalists" trope is silly and wrong. No, journalists will replace journalists. It's just that there will be fewer of them paid, and more of us unpaid. Some will be ex-newspapermen, others ex-bloggers, but both will be journalists. Instead of on paper, journalism will happen online. Instead of massaging your article to fit into two inches of the paper column, you will make your article's focus be on information, accuracy and truth. Instead of cringing at the readers' comments, you will learn how to moderate them and appreciate them and learn from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sources will &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php" title=""&gt;speak directly&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/smoke_signals_blogs_and_the_fu_2.php" title=""&gt;audience&lt;/a&gt;, instead of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/dc_press_core_dissed_again_-_b.php" title=""&gt;via middle-men&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php" title=""&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/07/scientists_are_excellent_commu.php" title=""&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt;. But some sources will not speak unless forced to by a journalist. And some sources are not humans, but animals, or machines, or natural phenomena, or old documents, and cannot talk to the audience without a middle-man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us will be both consumers and producers of media in our spare time. We may become journalists if news fall into our laps - we become Accidental Journalists for a day or a week, and provide information that others cannot but we, due to circumstances, can. That will not eliminate a journalist's job, but provide a journalist with a source and a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us will occasionally commit acts of journalism, or provide information needed for a story, or provide opinion needed for an op-ed, but very few of us will care to do that for a living, every day. We don't want to take the journalists' jobs away, we want them to thrive, but it is a reality that there are too many of them, and that many of the aspects of their job descriptions are now better done by machines, or by crowds of people, than by individuals. Let the best of them remain journalists, adapted to the new, better ways of doing things. Let's hope the others find decent jobs elsewhere so they can feed their families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 100 years ago, many horse trainers, saddle-makers and blacksmiths became car repairmen. A much better career decision than just sitting there and complaining how cars will never replace the horses. My father owned a printing press, and worked in the printing business his entire life. I went with him there several times as a kid. I loved the typesetting machines, and the printing presses, and the smells and sounds. I loved printing stuff at home with my letter stamps. I love the feel and smell of a fresh print. Both my brother and I were in some way involved with school newspapers and such when we were young. But that era is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent most of my life working with horses. I love the feeling of riding a horse, the smell of fresh hay, the sounds of horses munching their oats. But I do not saddle up my horse to go to the grocery store. I don't even own a horse any more. It is just not a viable method of transportation any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that does not mean that horses are extinct. There are thousands being bred every year for sport and show and leisure. They are pampered and loved much better than when they were just means of transport, when both people who loved them and who hated them had to use them. Horses (or mules or oxen or llamas or camels) are also still a key method of transportation in those places in the world where there is no infrastructure for the cars: roads, gas stations, garages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, newspapers will become extinct as a major means of news-delivery. But they will persist in the hands of hobbyists and local communities who love them. And they will persist in places in the world where there is no infrastructure for the Internet: electricity, computers, wifi. Perhaps those who so strongly agitate for saving the newspapers should go there - their services will be useful in such places for a while longer. There, they can be &lt;a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2009/03/23/the-blackboard-blogger-of-africa/" title=""&gt;analog bloggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us get on with the business of building a new journalism, &lt;a href="http://contexts.org/thickculture/2009/03/28/web-print-the-singularity-of-media/" title=""&gt;fit&lt;/a&gt; for the new century and Millennium. The rest is nostalgia. Counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, we had many, many discussions &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/science_blogging_what_it_can_b.php" title=""&gt;about science blogging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/30/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important-questions-answered-by-34-science-bloggers" title=""&gt;why do we blog&lt;/a&gt;, and how we &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2006/06/ask_a_scienceblogger_june_15.php" title=""&gt;find time to blog&lt;/a&gt;, and why scientists and academics &lt;a href="http://biochemicalsoul.com/2009/03/science-blogging-the-future-of-science-communication-why-you-should-be-a-part-of-it/" title=""&gt;should blog&lt;/a&gt;, there &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php" title=""&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_its_good_to_blog.php" title=""&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bluesci.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=819&amp;amp;Itemid=504" title=""&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/8/1/37/1/" title=""&gt;editorials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.falter.at/web/heureka/blog/?p=29" title=""&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on this topic and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WSN-4NMMB5G-3&amp;amp;_user=209690&amp;amp;_coverDate=05%2F04%2F2007&amp;amp;_rdoc=3&amp;amp;_fmt=summary&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%237051%232007%23998709996%23651333%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;amp;_cdi=7051&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;_ct=24&amp;amp;_acct=C000014438&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=209690&amp;amp;md5=d0c6248c14378d865e9eb55e46a28e6c" title=""&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060240" title=""&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/07/02/Jcom0702(2008)C01/Jcom0702(2008)C06/" title=""&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbcnc08/" title=""&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09/" title=""&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major questions that crops up repeatedly in these discussions is the matter of reach. Science blogs, similarly to popular science magazines, are in the "pull" more - attracting readers who are &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; interested in science. But how do we do "push", i.e., throw science at unsuspected citizens, in hope they will find it interesting or useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, having science taught well in schools is the best 'push' strategy because it is mandated by the state. When I graduated from high school I had 8 years of physics, 8 years of chemistry and 8 years of biology behind me, instead of one of each as US students get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But besides that, 'push' is very difficult. Back when there were only a couple of TV channels, if there is an hour-long science documentary, everyone watched it because that was on the program. And people liked it. But today, there is none on major TV channels and one has to seek science, nature or medicine on specialized channels. Likewise for radio - there is Ira Flatow every &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/" title=""&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt; on NPR and that is about it - easy to flip the station or put in a CD instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any time in the past, newspapers had a lot of (and good) science coverage, that would have been somewhat of a 'push' strategy. At that time, people were not inundated with information and were more likely to read the paper cover-to-cover. They could still skip the science section, but on some days a headline might have piqued their curiosity and made them read. Today, newspapers have little to no science, and there is less and less paper anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as soon as the newspaper dies in any given market, the people are forced to go online for information. If the local newspaper is replaced by a news website or blog, this is where people will go (and &lt;a href="http://xark.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/03/the-fire-that-frees-the-seed.html" title=""&gt;sooner the papers die, sooner their monopoly on information will go away&lt;/a&gt;, so online upstarts can move into the void).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once people are online, they will be there in as great numbers as newspapers ever had. Now, if that local news-site does not hide its science section a click or two away ("pull"), but showcases the science headlines right there on the front page, this will be better push than newspapers could ever do. No need to turn the leaf, or click - the headlines are staring at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a site like &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" title=""&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, which just got funds to pay reporters, publicly eliminates their &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=huffington+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search" title=""&gt;pseudoscience, HIV denialist, New Age woo-mongers&lt;/a&gt; and hires some real science/nature/medicine reporters instead, it is in a position to do the 'push strategy' on science. I bet some of the science bloggers would like to get that gig. And then link to us who are doing the 'pull' strategy here on Scienceblogs.com (or &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/" title=""&gt;Nature Network&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/" title=""&gt;Discover&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/defining_the_journalism_vs_blo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/qX8ihVAIflE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238444166535"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/peevish_inquiries_in_oklahoma.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/273a984101dc5a06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Peevish inquiries in Oklahoma continue</title><published>2009-03-30T20:37:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T20:37:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/y571LmOiPy0/peevish_inquiries_in_oklahoma.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/peevish_inquiries_in_oklahoma.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Legislators in the fine state of Oklahoma &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;amp;articleid=20090330_11_A1_Statel165138"&gt;continue to gnash their grim and yellowed Christian tusks in frustration that Richard Dawkins was ever allowed to speak&lt;/a&gt;. He not only spoke openly, but was allowed to leave the state unscathed — not a single rusty thumbscrew was employed, nor was he burned at the stake. The university thinks that is just fine, but these cornpone dullards pretending to be representatives of American freedom just don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a phone interview Thursday, Thomsen said the university has a right to bring any speaker it chooses, but is accountable to taxpayers. On behalf of his constituents, Thomsen wanted to present the opinion that Dawkins doesn't represent Oklahoma's ideals. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"They're not in a plastic bubble that can't be touched," he said. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dawkins' approach doesn't present freedom of thought and opinion, Thomsen said. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"His presence at OU was not about science," he said. "It was to promote an atheistic agenda, and that was very clear." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was Mr Thomsen at the talk? I think not, or he'd know that he was giving his "Purpose of Purpose" lecture, which was about the perception of teleology in biology and evolution. Or maybe he just assumes that &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; talk about science is promoting an atheistic agenda, a presumption that would not surprise me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really getting jealous. The best rejection I ever got was getting kicked out of a mere movie theater…and Dawkins has casually stirred the ire of an entire state. Are there any small nations that would like to outlaw me?

It seems to me that the evidence is in and that the consensus is against spanking. Studies show that spanking is no more effective for behavior correction than other forms of discipline, arguably even less effective. And yet, it’s still a widely accepted form of discipline… some people even think it’s ridiculous not to spank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, &lt;a href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/pediatrics%3B101/4/723.pdf"&gt;Guidance for Effective Discipline&lt;/a&gt; (which I suggest reading, BTW):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its common acceptance, and even advocacy&lt;br&gt;
for its use, spanking is a less effective strategy&lt;br&gt;
than time-out or removal of privileges for reducing&lt;br&gt;
undesired behavior in children. Although spanking&lt;br&gt;
may immediately reduce or stop an undesired behavior,&lt;br&gt;
its effectiveness decreases with subsequent&lt;br&gt;
use. The only way to maintain the initial effect of&lt;br&gt;
spanking is to systematically increase the intensity&lt;br&gt;
with which it is delivered, which can quickly escalate&lt;br&gt;
into abuse. Thus, at best, spanking is only effective&lt;br&gt;
when used in selective infrequent situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it about spanking that is so enticing as a form of discipline? Do you spank your kids? Were you spanked as a kid? Do you think it’s okay to spank kids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238440566179"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/vampires_of_boston.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66fb5d7d45afcba1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Vampires of Boston!</title><published>2009-03-30T19:59:31Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T19:59:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/GbGOS6Ep0yE/vampires_of_boston.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/vampires_of_boston.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Administrators at &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/27/vampire_rumors_spur_alert_at_boston_latin___on_bullying/"&gt;Boston Latin prep school issued a notice that there were &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; — I repeat, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; — vampires&lt;/a&gt; attending the school.

That's what they said, at least. You knew it couldn't be true: they're already &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/outsider-meddling-skeptics-need-not-apply-or-just-have-faith/"&gt;sharpening the knives to get rid of a persistent critic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone by the name of skeech is cluttering up UD with impervious sophistry and wasting a lot of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His/her latest thesis is that &amp;quot;according to biologists…&amp;quot; there is a &amp;quot;credible possibility that small incremental changes could have developed massive increases in biological information in a short time -- followed by stasis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, skeech assures us that "biologists" are universally agreed upon this proposition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about this and this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, biologists are universally agreed upon that. Skeech was being very conservative in his description — it&amp;#39;s more than a &amp;#39;credible possibility&amp;#39;,  both relatively rapid changes and patterns of stasis have been demonstrated. The &amp;quot;this and this&amp;quot; mentioned were links I won&amp;#39;t repeat to the absurd &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/forbes-loses-it-again-over-evolution/"&gt;Phil Skell&lt;/a&gt; and some ID guy at an evangelical Christian college. I guess those are the "biologists" he's talking about (Skell, by the way, is a chemist). I'll have to remember to waggle my fingers in the universal air-quotes gesture whenever I'm talking about the "biologists" on the side of creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the real foolishness begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwinian evolutionary theory is a boiling, ever-changing, amorphous cloud that is impenetrable and completely immune to critical analytical scrutiny. It was designed that way, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an amazing glimpse into the creationist mindset — apparently, they see design everywhere. Evolutionary theory was not designed. It &lt;i&gt;evolved&lt;/i&gt;. There are a great many contributors to it, all pushing the boundaries in different directions, which is why grasping the depth of the idea is beyond these guys — it takes a lot of work to keep up with the literature, and the details can be bewildering (just try keeping up with all the comparative molecular biology work on developmental genes, for instance; it&amp;#39;s a deluge of papers right now). However, the core principles are straightforward and can be grasped by most people with a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now watch: the angry kook emerges. How often has poor Albert Einstein's corpse been dragged out and made to dance in defense of every new loony idea?&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the "scientific" consensus in the early 20th century was the steady-state universe theory (that is, the universe is eternal, and has no beginning and no end). Those subscribing to the consensus were wrong (including Albert Einstein), and they put up a big fight until the end, when the evidence became overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continental drift theory was also ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wegener was the first to use the phrase &amp;quot;continental drift&amp;quot; (1912, 1915)… During Wegener&amp;#39;s lifetime, his theory of continental drift was severely attacked by leading geologists, who viewed him as an outsider meddling in their field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where's Galileo? He forgot Galileo! We need to be able to use the "They laughed at Galileo, but they also laughed at Bozo the Clown" line! I need &lt;i&gt;closure&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. The operative phrase up there is &amp;quot;the evidence became overwhelming&amp;quot;. The evidence for Intelligent Design creationism is less than overwhelming; it&amp;#39;s definitely not at the level of &amp;quot;impressive&amp;quot;. It hasn&amp;#39;t even reached &amp;quot;thought-provoking&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;hmmm…maybe&amp;quot;. It seems to be stuck at &amp;quot;non-existent&amp;quot;. They can invoke Einstein and Wegener as patron saints when they actually have something persuasive other than their religious certainty that there must be a designer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticism we always hear from Darwinists is: Outsiders are not permitted to question the dogma, because they don't understand the subtleties and the "science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re allowed to question it, of course. It&amp;#39;s just that when your criticisms reveal a dazzling degree of ignorance of basic biology, we&amp;#39;re going to laugh and dismiss your arguments out of hand. And of course, evolution is science — it&amp;#39;s not the ersatz &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; beloved of creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essence of Darwinian philosophy, presented as "science," takes about 15 minutes to learn and understand: Random variation and natural selection explain everything -- never mind the details, we'll make up stories later to explain away the anomalies, contradictions, and improbabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, just have faith, and don't ask any annoying questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not science, it's religious indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what happened to the &amp;quot;amorphous cloud&amp;quot;? Suddenly evolution is something you can grasp in 15 minutes. Yes, it&amp;#39;s true, though: random variation and selection are the basic principles that explain everything. But no, the details are important — we&amp;#39;ve got a century and a half worth of details, &lt;i&gt;evidence&lt;/i&gt;, that we can go over. It'll take a lot more than 15 minutes. We don't need to make up stories (even though some do, admittedly), we can leave that to the defenders of myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am amused that that little UD rant was prompted by a guy asking annoying questions, getting the administrators of UD to complain falsely that real science doesn&amp;#39;t let you ask annoying questions, while they do their best to suppress critics who ask annoying questions. The growing hypocrisy is just one more reason their blog is increasingly irrelevant…that and their vacuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't it nice of me to give them a link that will vastly increase their traffic? I should probably stop doing that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/uncommon_hypocrisy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/nQwgJNyTJ5U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238440041041"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/30/the-discovery-institute-has-no-shame/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8176b2eaa8d9171</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">The Discovery Institute has no shame</title><published>2009-03-30T19:00:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T19:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/30/the-discovery-institute-has-no-shame/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Disco ‘tute is a group of people in Seattle who claim to be all about Intelligent Design, but are in fact just trying to impose their religious views on everyone else. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/04/silly-creationists-universities-are-for-scientists/"&gt;This has been so well-documented&lt;/a&gt; — kinda like evolution and the fact that the Earth is billions of years old — that it would be crazy to deny it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outpatient Rotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to give all of their students experience in outpatient medicine, most med schools must reach out to the community.  Sure, some med schools have big enough clinics to support an experience for all of their students, but that’s the minority.  For their internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine rotations, med students often spend time at private doctors’ offices.  These offices are minimally vetted, and I’d venture to guess that the vetting does not include checking for non-standard practices.   In fact, schools are so desperate for spots, that almost any office will do.  It’s good for students to see how medicine is practiced in the “real world” but that real world often involves cult medicine practices.  Along the same lines, many practitioners are not up to date on the most recent best practices.  I remember a family doc I worked with who used to give huge doses of intramuscular steroids to people for seasonal allergies.  This isn’t the best idea, but I was a student. Who was I to tell him how to practice medicine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t police our colleagues very effectively—we have surrendered that duty largely to the courts.  However, if doctors want a medical school affiliation, it seems a small price to allow the school to come in and see if the office practices medicine  according to the standard of care.  In addition to checking for the most minimal quality standards, it would rule out docs who are offering voodoo in place of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsored Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of medical student groups out there—some supporting peoples’ choice of specialty, some with religious or cultural affiliations, and other simply for fun.  It’s not unusual for these groups to bring in speakers.  There is generally a collegial atmosphere at medical schools—for example, I am staunchly pro-choice, and a friend and fellow student was staunchly anti-abortion, and belonged to a Christian medical student group.  We sparred frequently, including having dueling letters to the editor in the Chicago Tribune, but we also often had a beer together and hung out.  We understood that we would not agree on this issue and that we would each fight hard for our position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when this collegiality breaks down?   I’ve heard of instances where medical students have spoken out and been slapped down by their fellow students.  This is a very common tactic of cult medicine groups—since they can’t win on facts, they cannot tolerate dissent.  If a student is harassed for speaking out against CAM on campus, who is she to turn to for support?  Will she receive support from her dean?  Will she be asked to make nice with the people promoting harmful practices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a recent meeting of the American Medical Student Association, a bill was introduced to officially recognize naturopathic students as “medical students”.   Medical students are just starting their journey to become doctors are are vulnerable to this “inclusiveness” message.  The bill was thankfully voted down, but this helps illustrate how deeply the alties are working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at a crossroads in medical education.  Proponents of made-up medical practices are infiltrating the academy at every level, and trying to convert medical students at a vulnerable time.  When they are called out, they cry foul.  The tactics are quasi-religious.  Those of us in medical education have a grave responsibility.  We must train doctors who are compassionate and who understand the difference between science-based medicine and everything else.  It’s time to be less inclusive in our curricula.  It’s time to have coursework that specifically addresses made-up medical practices, explains why they are wrong, dangerous, and unethical.  It is time to take the offensive.  It both delights and saddens me that this blog is one of the centers for the defense of medicine.  It shouldn’t have to be that way.  That being said, we will continue to be a resource for those interested in keeping the science in medicine, and will hopefully help birth some additional resources in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a student or educator and are concerned about made-up medicine in your institution, feel free to email us.  We share emails among ourselves but with no one else, and we will not write about your situation without your explicit permission.  It’s time we all joined the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

But look at what they still teach at Westminster University.</title><published>2009-03-30T18:10:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T18:10:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.dcscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In March 2007 I wrote a piece in Nature on &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=19"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science degrees without the science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  At that time there were five “BSc” degrees in homeopathy. A couple of weeks ago I checked the UCAS site for start in 2009, and found there was only one full “BSc (hons)” left and that was at Westminster University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I checked again and NOW THERE ARE NONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A phone call to the University of Westminster tonight confirmed that they have suspended entry to their BSc (Hons) homeopathy degree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They say that they have done so because of “poor recruitment”.   It was a purely financial decision.  Nothing to do with embarrasment.  Gratifying though it is that recruits for the course are vanishing, that statement is actually pretty appalling   It says that the University of Westminster doesn’t care whether it’s nonsense, but only about whether it makes money. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the first part of this post is not entirely outdated before it even appeared, because homeopathy will still be taught as part of &lt;a href="http://www.wmin.ac.uk/Default.aspx?page=3135"&gt;Complementary  Therapies. And Naturopathy and “Nutritional Therapy” are still there.&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their ‘&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/cam-courses.pdf"&gt;School  of Integrated Health&lt;/a&gt;‘, “The University of Westminster has a vision of  health care for the 21st Century”. Yes, but it is what most people would call a vision of health care in the 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation that the University of Westminster teaches that &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;Amethysts emit high Yin energy&lt;/a&gt; caused something of a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I have acquired from several sources quite a lot more of their teaching material, despite the fact that the university has refused to comply with the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=984#wmin"&gt; rather silly internal review &lt;/a&gt;conducted by Westminster’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, this seems like a good moment to make a bit more of it public,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that revelation of the material is justified because it is in the&lt;br&gt;
  public interest to know how the University if Westminster is spending taxpayers’ money.  Another motive is to defend the reputation of the post-1992 universities.   I  have every sympathy with the ex-polytechnics in their efforts to convert themselves into universities.  In many ways they have succeeded.  That effort&lt;br&gt;
  is impeded by teaching mystical versions of medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the University of Westminster is being brought into disrepute, blame its vice-chancellor, not me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Homeopathic spiders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few slides from a lecture on how good spider venom is for you.  It  is from Course 3CTH502 Homeopathic Materia Medica II.  No need to worry though, because they are talking about homeopathic spider venom, so there is  nothing but sugar in the pills. The involvement of spiders is pure imagination.  No more than mystical gobbledygook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-10s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-12s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in hurry, or play with your fingers?  You need spider venom pills (that contain no spider venom). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-11s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-13s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-16s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-18s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You break furniture? Time goes too fast for you?  Try the tarantula-free tarantula pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-19s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-23s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are preoccupied with sex? You play with ropes?  What you need is &lt;em&gt;Mygale&lt;/em&gt; (which contains no &lt;em&gt;Mygale&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-29s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-30s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more seriously, the same sugar pills are recommended for serious conditions,  chorea, ‘dim sight’, gonorrhoea, syphilis and burning hot urine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/3CTH502%20Homeopathic%20Materia%20Medica%20II%20Spiders-31s.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just preposterous made-up stuff.  It is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole lot more fantasy stuff in the handouts for Homeopathy Materia Medica II (3CTH502). Here are a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aurum metallicum&lt;/strong&gt; (metallic gold) [&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/AURUM%20METALLICUM.pdf"&gt;Download the whole handout&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affinities  MIND, VASCULAR SYSTEM, Nerves, Heart, Bones, Glands, Liver,  Kidneys, RIGHT SIDE, Left side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causations Emotions. Ailments from disappointed love and grief, offence or  unusual responsibility, abuse of mercury or allopathic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurum belongs to the syphilitic miasm but has elements of sycosis (Aur-Mur). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potassium salts&lt;/strong&gt; are the subject of some fine fantasy, in “The  Kali’s” [sic]. (there is much more serious stuff to worry about here than a  few misplaced apostrophes.). [&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/Kali&amp;#39;s.pdf"&gt;Download the whole handout&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The radioactive element of potassium emits negative electrons from the atom nucleus and is thought to be significant in the sphere of cell processes especially in relation to functions relating to automatism and rhythmicity.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kali people are very conscientious with strong principles. They have their rules and they stick to them, ‘a man of his word’.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Potassium acts in a parasympathetic way, tending towards depression”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They [&amp;quot;Kali people=] are not melancholic like the Natrum’s but rather optimistic.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radioactive potassium is involved in automaticity?  Total nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where is the science?  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is true that the students get a bit of real science.  There isn’t  the slightest trace that I can find of any attempt to resolve the obvious fact  that what they are taught in the science bits contradict directly what they are told in the other bits.  Sounds like a recipe for stress to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even get a bit of incredibly elementary statistics.  But they can’t even get that right.  This slide is from PPP - Res Quant data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/PPP%20-%20Res%20Quant%20data%20analysis-25s.jpg" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Involves parameters and/or distributions”.  This has no useful meaning whatsoever, that I can detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tests hypotheses when population distributions are skewed”.  Well yes, though nothing there about forms of non-Gaussian properties other than skew, nothing about normalising transformations, and nothing about the Central Limit theorem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ranks data rather than the actual data itself”.  This is plain wrong.  Randomisation tests on the original data are generally the best (uniformly most powerful) sort of non-parametric test. It seems to have escaped the attention of the tutor that ranking is a short-cut approximation that allowed tables to be constructed, before we had computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students are told about randomised controlled trials.  But amazingly in the lecture PPP-RCTs, the little matter of blinding is barely mantioned.  And  the teacher’s ideas about randomisation are a bit odd too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/PPP%20-%20RCTs-12s.jpg" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but if you fiddle the randomisation, no amount of “careful scrutiny” will rescue you from bias.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Introduction to Naturopathic Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturopathy is just about as barmy as homeopathy. You can see something about it at the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=259"&gt;University of Wales&lt;/a&gt;.  How about this slide from Westminster’s &lt;em&gt;An Introduction  to Naturopathic Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/An%20Introduction%20to%20Naturopathic%20Philosophy-14s.jpg" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you get tuberculosis, it isn’t caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis?&lt;/em&gt;   And the symptoms are “constructive”?   So you don;t need to do anything. It’s all for the best really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just nonsense.  It’s dangerous nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what the mysterious “Qi” is?   Worry no more. All is explained on this slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/CM%20lecture-qi-3s.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism.  Or perhaps prana?  Is that quite clear now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/CM%20lecture-29-diagnosis-s.jpg" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we make of this one?  Anyone can see that the description is barely written in English and that vital information is missing (such as the age of the woman). And it’s nonsense to suggest that “invasion of cold” (during keyhole surgery!) would cause  prolonged constriction of blood vessels (never mind that it would “consume yang qi”).  Not being a clinician, I showed it to an oncologist friend.  He said that it was impossible to tell from the description whether the problem was serious or not, but that any abdominal pain should be investigated properly. There isn’t anything here about referral for proper investigation.  Just a lot of stuff about ginger  and cinnamon. Anyone who was taught in this way could be a real danger to the public. It isn’t harmless nonsense  It’s potentially harmful nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, it’s DETOX&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely everyone knows by now that ‘detox’ is no more than a marketing word?  Well not at the University of Westminster.  They have a long handout  that tells you all the usual myths and a few new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written by Jennifer Harper-Deacon, who describes herself modestly, thus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Harper-Deacon is a qualified and registered Naturopath and acupuncturist who holds a PhD in Natural Health and MSc in Complementary Therapies. She is  a gifted healer and Reiki Master who runs her own clinic in Surrey where she  believes in treating the ‘whole’ person by using a combination of Chinese medicine  and naturopathic techniques that she has qualified in, including nutritional medicine, Chinese and Western herbalism, homoeopathy, applied kinesiology,  reflexology, therapeutic massage, aromatherapy and flower remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is no limit on the number of (mutually incompatible) forms of nuttiness that she believes.  Here are a few quotations from her handout for Westminster students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Detoxification is the single most powerful tool used by natural health professionals to prevent and reverse disease”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? To “prevent and reverse” malaria? tuberculosis? Parkinson’s disease? AIDS?  cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you go on to a raw food only diet, especially fruit, the stored toxins are brought up from the deep organs such as the liver and kidneys, to the superficial systems of elimination.”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very odd. I always though that kidneys &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a system of elimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The over-use and mis-use of antibiotics has weakened the body’s ability to attack and destroy new strains of resistant bacteria, virulent viruses, which have led to our immune system becoming compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly over-use and mis-use are problems.  But I always thought it was the bacteria that became resistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The beauty about detoxification therapy is that it addresses the very causative issues of health problems”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is another dangerous and silly myth. Tuberculosis is not caused by  mythical and un-named “toxins”.  It is caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Naturopathy follows the logic of cause and effect therefore believes that we simply need pure food and water, sunshine, air, adequate rest and sleep coupled with the right amount of exercise for health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try telling that to someone with AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Colon cleansing is one of the most important parts of any detoxification programme.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange obsession with enemas in the alternative world is always baffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Frankincense:&lt;/strong&gt; holds the capacity to physically strengthen our defence system and can rebuild energy levels when our immune system is  weak. Revered as a herb of protection, frankincense can also strengthen our spiritual defences when our Wei qi is low, making us more susceptible to negative energies. This calming oil has the ability to deepen the breath, helping us to let go of stale air and emotions, making it ideal oil to use inhale prior to meditating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so much hot air. There is a bit of evidence that frankincense &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/dec17_2/a2813"&gt;might  have some anti-inflammatory action&lt;/a&gt; and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has to be my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember when shopping to favour fruits and vegetables which are in season and locally grown (and ideally organic) as they are more vibrationally compatible with the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally grown vegetables  are “more vibrationally compatible with the body”?  Pure mystical gobbledygook. Words fail me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK there’s a whole lot more, but that will do for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good that Westminster is shutting down its Homeopathy BSc, but it seems they have a bit further to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238436451692"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6791">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4574e6f078ca6d6e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="books"/><category term="contest"/><title type="html">Literary Smackdown</title><published>2009-03-30T17:39:53Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T17:39:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/b_Q5rvDMUuQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/literary-smackdown/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| Every weekday in March, a judge at The Morning News has pitted against each other two novels published last year, with one emerging as the winner and going up against the next book.

There’s also &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/?article=WhatDoIDoNext"&gt;an online Quick Reference Guide&lt;/a&gt;, a shorter version if you’re impatient like me. The bulleted list has just the facts with quickie advice. There’s also &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/get_involved/skeptical_activism.html"&gt;a Skeptical Activism page&lt;/a&gt; on Skeptics.com, and &lt;a href="http://www.skepticforum.com/viewforum.php?f=73"&gt;a forum&lt;/a&gt; where you can interact with other like-minded folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you a question: who are your skeptical heroes? Randi? Genie Scott? Michael Shermer? Penn&amp;amp;Teller? Barbara Forrest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think these folks have always been giants in their field? No. &lt;em&gt;They started off just like you and me.&lt;/em&gt; Intelligent, curious, reality-based people who, one day, &lt;strong&gt;had had enough&lt;/strong&gt;. So they did something about it. That’s what &lt;a href="http://stopsylvia.com/"&gt;Robert Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; did. That’s what &lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net"&gt;Tim Farley&lt;/a&gt; did. That’s what &lt;a href="http://www.skepchick.org"&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did something, and they’re making a difference. &lt;em&gt;So can you&lt;/em&gt;. Get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238436198377"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/more_stupid_graphs.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e98f81c6c2a7956</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Economics"/><title type="html">More Stupid Graphs</title><published>2009-03-30T15:46:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T15:46:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/JPHsIyUNchk/more_stupid_graphs.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/more_stupid_graphs.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Remember the post I made a couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/financial_morons_and_quadratic.php"&gt;flaming the wall-street idiots for

Here’s the punchline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[W]e can surely demand that the principle of “strengths and weaknesses” will be applied evenly. If any church in Texas receives a tax exemption, or if any religious institution is the beneficiary of any subvention from the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, we must be assured that it will devote a portion of its time to laying bare the “strengths and weaknesses” of the religious world view, and also to teaching the works of Voltaire, David Hume, Benedict de Spinoza, Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson. This is America. Let a hundred flowers bloom, and a thousand schools of thought contend. We may one day have cause to be grateful to the Texas Board of Education for lighting a candle that cannot be put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Runners, listen up: If your body is telling you that your pace feels a little too fast or a little too slow, it may be right. A new study, published online March 18 in the Journal of Human Evolution, shows that the efficiency of human running varies with speed and that each individual has an optimal pace at which he or she can cover the greatest distance with the least effort.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090324081439.htm" title=""&gt;Early Agriculture Left Traces In Animal Bones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unraveling the origins of agriculture in different regions around the globe has been a challenge for archeologists. Now researchers writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report finding evidence of early human experiments with grain cultivation in East Asia. They gathered this information from an unlikely source―dog and pig bones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Using cell phones and playing video games may not be as harmful to children's academic performance as previously believed, according to new research by a team of Michigan State University scholars. In fact, cell phones had no effect on academic performance among a group of 12-year-olds, the researchers found in a three-year study published by the Conference Proceedings of the International Association for Development of the Information Society, or IADIS, in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_639.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yBJPldWguyk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238434197962"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/30/why-cant-we-visualize-more-than-three-dimensions/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/874bfdd377fc8711</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Mathematics"/><title type="html">Why Can’t We Visualize More Than Three Dimensions?</title><published>2009-03-30T17:29:32Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T17:29:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/30/why-cant-we-visualize-more-than-three-dimensions/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Physicists and mathematicians who think about higher-dimensional spaces are, if they allow their interest to somehow become public knowledge, inevitably asked:  “How can you &lt;em&gt;visualize&lt;/em&gt; more than three dimensions of space?”  There are at least three correct answers:  (1) You can’t.  (2) You don’t have to; manipulating abstract symbols is enough to help you figure things out.  (3)  There are tricks to help you pseudo-visualize higher-dimensional objects by cleverly projecting them into three dimensions; see &lt;a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/35740/title/Math_Trek__Seeing_in_four_dimensions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scitalks.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/visualizing-4-dimensions/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, why can’t we visualize things in more than three dimensions of space?  Could a Flatlander, living in a world with only two spatial dimensions, learn to visualize our three-dimensional world?  Could we somehow, through practice or direct intervention in the brain, train ourselves to truly visualize more dimensions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of a couple of explanations why it’s so hard, with different ramifications.  One would be simply that our imaginations aren’t good enough to project our consciousness into a constructed world so very different from our own.  Could you, for example, really imagine what it’s like to live in &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; dimensions?   Sure, you can visualize Flatland from the outside, but what about asking what it’s like to really be a Flatlander?  The best I can do is to imagine a line, flickering with colors, surrounded by darkness on either side.  But the darkness is still there, in my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other possible explanation is that the process of visualization takes up a three-dimensional space in our actual brain, preventing us from “tuning a dimensionality knob” on our imaginations.  The truth is certainly more complicated than that (and I’m not experts, so anyone who is should chime in); the &lt;a href="http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005/02/hallucinatory-neurophysics.html"&gt;visual cortex&lt;/a&gt; itself is effectively two-dimensional, but somehow our brain reconstructs a three-dimensional image of the space around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this could be a new tantric discipline:  visualization in higher dimensions.  Or maybe the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/03/15/maharishi-mathematics/"&gt;Maharishi&lt;/a&gt; already offers a course?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Say you have a client who only wants to talk about Batman," the presenter set up the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience, primarily consisting of service providers and parents who referred to the few autistic audience members in third person throughout the day, all had a good, hearty laugh at that.  (I was not amused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion continued, Oh noes!  Only wants to talk about Batman!  Whatever shall we do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter: behavior modification, job coaching, rules and rules and rules, hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*head desk*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shift the context.  A person without any sort of disability is seeking career advice.  "What are you interested in?" is likely one of the first things asked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, it's kind of silly, but I really like comic books, especially Batman."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OK, great, have you considered working in a comic book shop?" would be a likely reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, I considered it, but I don't really like retail, I've never done well with the public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What about working for a comic book manufacturer? Do you have any interest in learning more about printing pre-processing?" the session might continue.  Not, "Yes, liking Batman a lot is silly.  And don't talk about Batman to your co-workers either.  How about a nice job washing dishes?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like anyone, I succeed best at a job that is connected to my interests.  I thrive in a corporate environment that is suited to my personality and temperament, and doesn't require me to conform to mainstream social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matching autistic employees with jobs that suit their interests and personalities isn't radical stuff.  Boston University's ICI reference &lt;a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/article.php?article_id=266"&gt;Supporting Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Quality Employment Practices&lt;/a&gt; starts out saying the same thing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is imperative to match the job to the unique set of strengths, interests, and passions that the person with ASD brings to the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the self-advocate side, Joel Smith has an excellent collection of materials from his 2004 Autreat presentation &lt;a href="http://www.thiswayoflife.org/autreat04.html"&gt;Making Employment Fit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did the "expert" at the career planning workshop never mention finding work that suited a "client's" interests?  Or finding a corporate environment which is well suited for a person without needing to make large behavioral changes?  Or even mentioning jobs outside of custodianship, food service, stockrooms, or assembly lines, all of which have typically mainstream social or corporate cultures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way to know for sure, but it's likely influenced by defect (medical model) thinking about disability.  Seeing deficiencies instead of a human being will lead to considering every part of that person, including their interests, as pathology to be avoided or corrected.  It will lead to not seeing a person who can benefit from the same type of career counciling as any other person.  It will close off creative problem solving process.  It will see only limited, stereotyped solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an autistic job seeker is considered to be just like a non-disabled job seeker with respect to finding a job that suits their interests, skills, and personality, then a comic book shop or printer might be recommended first for the Batman lover, instead behavior modification that denies the person their legitimate interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From skimming recent news stories, &lt;a href="http://chattahbox.com/technology/2009/03/25/wiz-kid-hacker-now-works-to-stop-botnet-menace-hired-as-cyber-crime-expert/"&gt;Wiz Kid Hacker Now Works to Stop Botnet Menace: Hired as Cyber-Crime Expert&lt;/a&gt; is one story of what can happen when an autistic person's interests are channeled into employment that is well suited to their interests and abilities.  This story about an autistic man once diagnosed with intellectual disability who is now an &lt;a href="http://www.ksfy.com/news/health/41772312.html"&gt;Internal Bank Auditor with a Master's in Accounting&lt;/a&gt; is another.

If you heat yours with electricity from the grid, and if the structure isn't divided into many small rooms, then a heat pump will cut your power consumption so dramatically that the whole $2500 installation pays for itself in two years. And power consumption equals environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite a fascinating technology, and friendly to the environment too as long as you don't rupture a pipe and release circulation fluid. You know a fridge? An air source heat pump makes your house into a fridge &lt;i&gt;turned inside out&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat is movement among molecules. At absolute zero, molecules are still and there is no heat. What a fridge does is it removes heat from the inside of the cabinet and deposits it outside, in effect heating your kitchen ever so slightly at the expense of the food-spoiling microbes' comfort inside. A heat pump attempts to refrigerate &lt;i&gt;the outside world&lt;/i&gt;, depositing the harvested heat inside your house. Whether the temperature's freezing outside is irrelevant: as long as it's not absolute zero out there (which is rare even in Stockholm, Sweden), you can get all the heat you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer, you can shift the thing into reverse mode and use it as an air conditioner. I'm in awe!&lt;/p&gt;

I've loved the chicken at KFC ever since I was a kid. My parents were cheap, so KFC was splurging when I was growing up. About twice a year my pleading, perhaps in a combination with a well-timed TV advertisement, would convince my parents to bring the family to KFC.

Take that for what it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is partly why I am interested in news items, like &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/090329-game-vision.html"&gt;this one about a recent study&lt;/a&gt; that shows that playing certain kinds of video games correlates with improved visual ability.  Researcher Daphne Bavelier compared the visual ability of groups of subjects who were made to play various types of video games. In the active group the video games were action oriented - Unreal Tournament 2004 and Call of Duty 2. In the control group subjects played the same amount of The Sims 2 - 50 hours over 9 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bavelier found that the active group had a 58% improvement in a standard test of perceiving fine contrast differences - such as distinguishing fine shades of gray. This is a follow up study to a previous one by Bavelier where she found improvements between playing video games and not playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast distinction is an important visual skill, useful for night driving, nocturnal zombie hunting, and other tasks.  And the effect size is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first series of studies to show that playing video games can improve visual abilities. Dr. &lt;a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/Surgery/GeneralSurgery/5089"&gt;James Rosser published of study&lt;/a&gt; of his training program for laparoscopic surgery (surgery performed with instruments and a camera inserted through small holes), and he found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 33 residents and attending physicians in Dr. Rosser’s Top Gun Laparoscopic Skills and Suturing training program, those who currently played video games committed 32% fewer errors and were 24% faster than nonplayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These combined with other research are beginning to show a pattern - active video tasks, those that involve problem solving, visual skills, manual dexterity, and decision-making, improve ability in those tasks. Video games that do not involve those skills do not improve them. In this recent study, playing The Sims, which does not involve fast action, had no effect on visual discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how extensive is this effect? And, more importantly, what is the net effect on overall intelligence and academic performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Johnson, author of Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today’s Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter, &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/video-games-tv-do-they-make-kids-smarter"&gt;argues that today’s multimedia culture&lt;/a&gt; is all good and is making people smarter. His opinion is partly evidence-based and partly opinion, but is reasonably well argued. He argues that even television shows, like 24, require the audience to play close attention to plot details, and fill in missing elements to solve the unfolding mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s position is supported, at least in part, by the &lt;a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/FLYNNEFF.html"&gt;Flynn effect&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last five decades the average IQ of people living in industrialized nations has been increasing by about 3-8 IQ points per decade.  Further, the Flynn effect is strongest for abstract reasoning and non-verbal skills, and less for traditional verbal skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is no consensus as to what is causing the Flynn effect, this pattern could reflect exactly what Johnson is talking about - living in an increasingly complex and multimedia world is resulting in greater mental ability, especially in those areas needed to cope with just such a world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute - TV making kids smarter? That goes against the conventional wisdom, and a large body of research, showing that TV watching is associated with poorer academic performance.  But &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7626"&gt;this story is more complex also&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact reinforces the above pattern. The research does show that children who watch the least TV are more likely to graduate college than those who watch more, and that those children who watch the most TV are more likely not to graduate, to underperform academically, and to be obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, this effect was strongest for average IQ children and weakest for the highest and lowest IQs. This supports a general trend I have noticed, which makes sense, that environment has the strongest effect at those genetically in the middle of the Bell curve, while the extreme ends of genetic ability tend to trump environment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, back to the main point, the research also has many mixed results. For example, some studies show that the TV effect goes away when socioeconomic status is taken into consideration. But recent studies suggest that a stronger variable is likely at work - the type of TV that children are watching. Most of the studies that show a negative effect from TV watching did not control for entertainment vs educational TV. Those studies that do look at this variable show that educational TV has a positive effect on IQ and academic performance, while entertainment TV has a negative effect - independent of the amount of TV watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just like with video games, the type of TV seems to be the most important variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a recent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=09012960-is-technology-producing-decline-critical-thinking-analysis"&gt;review of the literature&lt;/a&gt; by Patricia Greenfield found that while consuming more multimedia improves visual learning, it may be hurting critical thinking skills that are better served by traditional reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another variable not yet discussed is that of novelty - doing new types of mental tasks. There is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=09012960-is-technology-producing-decline-critical-thinking-analysis"&gt;research suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that novelty has a very positive effect on learning.  Such tasks may also reduce the risk of dementia. The current thinking is that calling upon the brain to perform novel tasks coaxes it to form new pathways and connections, and may even recruit neural stem cells that are awaiting to form those new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a fairly rapid tour through a long and complex collection of research, which is also ongoing and has yet to address many important questions. However, the picture that has emerged so far, from my reading of all this research, is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall intelligence is on the rise, and this plausibly correlates to the increasing complexity of our modern world. This includes access to a plethora of information and media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the type of media and content matter greatly. Active tasks, those that involve specific mental skills such as hand-eye coordination, problem solving, visual tracking and discrimination, and critical thinking - will improve those skills.Therefore, active multimedia and other activities should be preferred over passive activity, and educational TV is better than purely entertainment TV (for those concerned with their cognitive ability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such tasks do not necessarily improve other mental skills, and if they are neglected those skills will atrophy. Therefore it is also better to consume a variety of media. Video games are great for visual learning and skills, but reading is better for the imagination and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It therefore seems to be more than OK to watch TV and play video games, as long as there is a good balance of educational TV in the mix, and the video games are not mindless. Also, multimedia consumption should be balanced with traditional activities, such as reading and perhaps even board games and traditional puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And occasionally mix it up - add new activities that you have never done before. Take up an instrument, play a new type of game, or learn a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will add that all of this mental activity should be balanced with physical activity as well, if we want to avoid becoming an increasingly sedentary and obese population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also now a cottage industry of products that will promise to achieve higher mental function through their scientifically formulated special computer programs or other activities. Such claims are generally not supported by evidence, meaning that there is no advantage to these often high-cost products over just following the advice I laid out above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go ahead, play your favorite video games. Just remember that the classic advice for moderation, variety, and balance seem to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

Why'd it have to be snakes?" This line was most famously delivered in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/quotes"&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/a&gt; after he and his friend Sallah had opened the Well of Souls and were staring down into it. Sallah noticed that the ground appeared to be moving within; so Indy shined a light down the entrance, only to see thousands of snakes waiting for him at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sallah then drily observed, "Asps. Very dangerous. You go first."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we knew from earlier in the movie, Indiana Jones hated snakes and was afraid of them; so it was only natural that later in the movie he would encounter a floor literally writhing with thousands of them. So it was when I innocently picked up the latest issue of &lt;a href="http://www.time.com"&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/a&gt; and started perusing it yesterday. What to my fearfully wondering eyes should appear but an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1887858,00.html"&gt;Mind over Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. Because I like chocolate, I was curious and began reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Move over, organic, fair trade and free range--the latest in enlightened edibles is here: food with "embedded" positive intentions. While the idea isn't new--cultures like the Navajo have been doing it for centuries--for-profit companies in the U.S. and Canada are catching on, infusing products with good vibes through meditation, prayer and even music.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reaction was much like Indy's: "Intent. Why'd it have to be intent?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which my imaginary companion replied, "Emoto. Very woo-ey. You go first."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will, because as much as the whole concept of "intent" in various "alternative medicine" and other woo irritates the crap out of me, it also holds a bizarre fascination as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/dr_emotos_water_woo_metastasizes.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/dr_emotos_water_woo_metastasizes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/LwMK9Evqrug" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238426832274"><id gr:original-id="fKlwSynj3RGeI1v_PhJ3AQ_8ee6fd31975f91c08825bbfc38059139">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7df2806a22db5990</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Seven alternatives to evidence based medicine</title><published>2009-03-30T14:09:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T14:09:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=28313" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">#3 Eloquence based medicine: Sartorial elegance and verbal eloquence are powerful substitutes for evidence.</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238426517917"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=578">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/205f946005a4b698</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ghosts/Demons"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="UFO's/Aliens"/><category term="alien"/><category term="ghost"/><category term="photo"/><title type="html">Ghoulgle</title><published>2009-03-30T15:20:57Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T15:20:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=578" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google Street View is a feature of Google Maps and Google Earth that provides panoramic views of many streets in the world. Google has fleets of vehicles that drive around and snap pictures of as many streets as possible. They even get around using bicycles in some cases. All of these individual images are digitally patched together as best as possible, to create wide, sweeping pictures of the streets at ground levels. The combination of technologies that makes this possible is quite ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as is true with just about all technology, cameras are not perfect, they are often misused by their handlers, they are subject to glitches and artifacts, and Google Street View is no exception to any of these instances. It is within this “noise” that the wonderful world of paranormal and pseudoscience grows and evolves, like a fungus in the darkest, dampest nooks and crannies of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping to keep the public’s mind off of (or out of) reality, The Telegraph served up a pair of headlines this past week, which read &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/google/5051309/Victorian-ghost-picked-up-by-Google-Street-View.html"&gt;“Victorian ‘ghost’ picked up by Google Street View”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/google/5042502/ET-tracked-down-on-Google-Street-View.html"&gt;“ET tracked down on Google Street View”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="google1" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google1-300x187.jpg" alt="google1" width="300" height="187"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Victorian ‘ghost’ story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Experts have been called in to examine the Google ghoul filmed at a former Victorian docklands which has a dark and sinister past … the scene of murders and unsolved mysteries going back 200 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called in? Who called? Google called? Do folks at Google think this is an apparition that they can’t otherwise explain? I suppose these are the kinds of questions get in the way of the reporters and editors work at The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly which “experts” were called. What is their expertise? Perhaps they mean people such as Jane Cohen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Local medium Jane Cohen, 39, said: “Apparitions have often been caught on film but are invisible to the naked eye. “This woman is very smart - but she is dressed in clothes that you just don’t see these days unless it’s in a period drama on TV. But what is really strange is that she doesn’t appear as a full figure - you can’t see all of her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane, you can’t see all of her because the image itself is a composite of skewed pictures pasted together as best as Google Street View could render. Even to the technologically impaired, you can easily make out the clear lines of distinction between the individual images. Just look at those concrete posts, and how they go askew. Look at the pavers in the street and how they change in size and angle. The only thing “really strange”, to borrow your words, Jane, is that you can’t figure this out without resorting to the paranormal. The ‘ghost’ in the image is a person, and that the person was dressed unconventionally does not make him or her any less of a person or any more of a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="PD*27727225" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google2-300x187.jpg" alt="PD*27727225" width="300" height="187"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is their ET article, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A misty shape, bearing a distinct similarity to the movie alien, was captured behind a bush next to a mysterious beam of light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the token quote was provided, not by a Google Street View representative, but rather a local crank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Malcolm Robinson, head of the Strange Phenomena Investigations, described the image as “the first of its kind”. He said “On close inspection the similarities with ET are obvious but it’s hard to say with any certainty what exactly it is…Of added interest is the strange beam of light to the right, which I cannot explain either…Without further details to go on I’m really stumped. We’d all love it to be alien, but that’s a big assumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his fellow crank was also quoted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nick Sawyer, one of many web-users to have spotted the alien-like creature, added: “Whatever it is, you cannot deny that it looks exactly like ET…The head is an oblong shape and it seems to have the same long neck and fat body. There is also a beam of light right next to him, who knows, that might be an unseen spaceship trying to make contact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is news?! Why is ANY of this news? These are such low-rag stories that are not worth the ones and zeroes that go into comprising the words and images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhpas the lone takeaway from these stories is the forewarning that we are going to have access to more of these kinds of images, and hence, more of these kinds of news stories, especially as Google Street View becomes more prominent. We can hope that improvements in technology in the coming years will correct these rendering issues that GSV is encountering, but until then, ghosts, ETs, leprechauns, and fairies will be appearing all over the streets of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Webster’s Dictionary’s definitions of the word ‘Ghoul’ includes “one who shows morbid interest in things considered shocking or repulsive”. I think an argument could be made that modern media treats mythology, superstition, nonsense with an interest that approaches morbid, is sometimes shocking, and too often repulsive. Maybe it is the nature of the beast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238425448147"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1282">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e2be25cb351bd8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">The dynamics of lexical competition in spoken word recognition</title><published>2009-03-30T15:04:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T15:04:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1282" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's Cathy addresses the topic of ambiguity resolution in speech:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/asteroid_incoming.jpg" alt="Artist drawing of an asteroid entering Earth’s atmosphere"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like (haha) another interplanetary interloper took it upon itself to explode in our atmosphere, &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2009/03/loud-explosions-lights-sky-reported-maryland-nc?t=1238380728"&gt;this time over the East coast of the US&lt;/a&gt;. There has been &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/booming-is-business/"&gt;a streak&lt;/a&gt; (haha) of these lately, and I’m getting emails asking if that’s unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it’s a bit unusual, but not crazy or apocalyptic, or even mildly worrisome. There’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of junk out there in space, and it doesn’t take a big piece of detritus to make a brilliant fireball. Something the size of a grapefruit will light up the night sky, and anything bigger than a beach ball will make a tremendous display even during the day. The thing to remember here is that these objects enter our atmosphere moving &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 11km/sec (7 miles/sec), and that translates into a huge amount of energy. They can have speeds up to ten times that much, too, meaning they have 100 times the energy (energy goes as velocity squared), and that energy is converted into heat and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rock slams into the air at those speeds, it compresses the air in front of it tremendously, which is why it gets hot (it’s not friction per se; compressing a gas heats it up, and we’re talking major compression here). This pressure also flattens the meteoroid, and it can break up into little pieces, each of which heat up, which then break up, heat up, and then &lt;strong&gt;BANG!&lt;/strong&gt; They release all their energy in an explosion. If that happens low enough in the atmosphere (though still many miles high), you can actually hear the non-Earth-shattering (sorry Marvin) but still quite loud kaboom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s almost certainly what happened over Virginia yesterday. People say they saw a streak in the sky, indicating this was a meteor… though I have to tell you that specifics in eyewitness reports of meteors can be misleading. One person quoted in that article said it was definitely heading down, but in reality they can’t know that. As a meteor streaks across the sky, it looks like it’s heading down, toward the ground, but that’s just perspective. If one were to skip off our air like a rock skipping on water (and that does happen), from the ground it might still look like it was heading down even though it might be moving up, away from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person said it was low, but again that is probably not correct. Most likely it was low in the sky, because the person was far away and the curving Earth made it look low, like the rising Moon at first is low to the Horizon. The object coming in was probably 20 km off the ground or higher. The only way you could know for sure it was low is if it passed in front of clouds (which would be hard to tell if the fireball were really bright) or in front of trees… which would mean you’re in some small amount of trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the frequency of these things? There have been so many lately! Are we under attack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think so. I think it’s a mix of coincidence — there may be a few more than usual, but it’s not like these things have published schedules; sometimes there are more and sometimes fewer — together with people being more aware of them because they’ve been in the news lately. It’s like buying a car and suddenly seeing it everywhere when you drive. We notice what we’re primed to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m not worried about these. Instead, I think it’s great! People are getting a first-hand taste of astronomy, and in a very exciting and memorable way! I hope people don’t get scared by this, and instead enjoy it. The Universe is talking to us, and people are starting to listen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238423732580"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6667">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fda4c7e3aa494bd4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="crime"/><title type="html">The Phantom of Heilbronn Unmasked</title><published>2009-03-30T14:04:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T14:04:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/3aoeuHmiOyE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/the-phantom-of-heilbronn-unmasked/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| For 16 years, police in Germany hunted a female serial killer whose DNA was identified at 40 crime scenes, including six murders.

I can't always respond. Does anyone, and I mean anyone, think his criticisms are on target and applicable?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Loftus does not even tackle the Bibles very prediction of this phenomenon in Romans 10:14-17. The apostle Paul states that faith comes from hearing, and hearing from preaching. Consequently one would suspect little Christian faith in a country where it is illegal to preach Christianity. Such is what we find at the moment giving rise to geographically placed Christianity specifically.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Loftus argues from the general to the particular. However there is no discussion about comparative religion and cultural heritage....For Mr Loftus’ argument to carry the weight he will need to define what one considers as part of the culture and what ones considers as a legitimate religion. Of course this will only weaken Mr Loftus’ case as it will become evidently clear that many of the examples given under the guise or religion are actually just cultural throw backs to antiquity,&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;if Mr Loftus wants the Christian to take ‘The Outside Test of Faith’ then surely he must ask the Christian to take the 'Insider Test of Atheism', or ITA. Meaning, showing why atheism makes sense and why people should not adopt skepticism towards atheism as appose to Christianity. Such a test would include proving miracles do not exists, beyond a shadow of a doubt; a naturalistic explanation for the origin of the universe, and the undeniable reasons why all religions (not just Christianity) should be disregarded. Indeed ITA would prove rather interesting placed alongside OTF, something Mr. Loftus fails to do in his book and on his blog.&lt;/blockquote&gt; An edited version of the &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/em&gt; (OTF) can be &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/outsider-test-for-faith_20.html"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;, and my additional defense of it can &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/answering-dr-repperts-criticisms-of.html"&gt;be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-8912767503646014542?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I was really excited to find this book in my library, since I’ve written quite a bit about &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/cochineal-its-a-bug-and-a-feature/"&gt;cochineal and it’s modern use&lt;/a&gt; as a food coloring.  The insect itself has a fascinating and complex history, and that’s exactly what this book covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;(A brief review: &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/cochineal-its-a-bug-and-a-feature/"&gt;cochineal&lt;/a&gt; is a red dye produced from an insect about the size of a lentil (&lt;em&gt;Dactylopius coccus&lt;/em&gt;), that spends her life &lt;a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/49451"&gt;sucking the juice of prickly pear&lt;/a&gt;.  When squished, a bright intense red results.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In addition to Elizabethan cloak and dagger intrigue, we also get empire, genocide, and alchemy in the search for riches in the New World.  This is a book for artists, history buffs, and bug lovers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Red dye was very difficult to come by in Europe before the 1500′s. Red dyes were made from &lt;a href="http://www.uri.edu/hss/tmd/Gal7Naturaldyes.htm"&gt;Madder&lt;/a&gt; (a plant root), which wasn’t really very red, or from &lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055%5B1080%3ATSDOTH%5D2.0.CO%3B2"&gt;Oak-Kermes scale insects&lt;/a&gt;.  Kermes scales did make a nice rich red, but were a pain to harvest, as was &lt;a href="http://www.azerbaijanrugs.com/arfp-natural_dyes_insect_dyes.htm#1.2)%20THE%20POLISH%20COCHINEAL%20INSECT%20AND%20ITS%20DYE"&gt;St. John’s Blood&lt;/a&gt;, another scale insect.  This made red dyes rare, expensive, and a sign of royalty and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;When Spain invaded what is now Mexico and other areas of South America in the 1500s, they were dazzled by the local fiery red fabrics.  It was the little cochineal insect, that had been carefully bred for centuries by indigenous people of Central and South America, that was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Unfortunately, Spaniards killed and looted first, and asked questions later–so for some time the mystery of cochineal production was almost lost.  Eventually they sorted it out, and created a craze in Europe with the rich intense red dyes.  Spain guarded the secret of the dye very jealously–and all sorts of trans-global espionage resulted with the Dutch, French, and English trying to figure out first just what the heck cochineal was (animal? vegetable? mineral?), and how to produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;One of the details I loved about this book is finding out so many things that I recognize are indirectly tied in some way to cochineal and its European invasion. I love random factoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cochineal is mentioned by&lt;a href="http://www.elook.org/literature/voltaire/candide/263.html"&gt; Voltaire’s Dr. Pangloss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s why some &lt;a title="Vermeer, for example" href="http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_carmine.html"&gt;famous paintings&lt;/a&gt; are so intensely red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph Banks, the man that&lt;a title="major mistake" href="http://www.northwestweeds.nsw.gov.au/prickly_pear_history.htm"&gt; imported prickly pear to Australia&lt;/a&gt; in a scheme to get rich off of cochineal, also sent &lt;a href="http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/naval/p/bligh.htm"&gt;Bligh and the Bounty&lt;/a&gt; on its voyage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our modern food dyes are made from coal tar–and this is indirectly related to cochineal. In 1856 &lt;a title="Chemist gets a Mauve on" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0312"&gt;WH Perkins&lt;/a&gt; discovered a way to create synthetic dyes (as an accident; he was trying to make a malarial cure). This led to the &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118556609/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;rise of a huge chemical dye industry&lt;/a&gt; (which eventually began making pesticides, too).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I could go on listing cool little tidbits, but I don’t want to make this too long.  It’s a long, complex, and fascinating story, and my only quibble is that it left me wanting to know more.  That’s probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I really wish the author would return to this subject and pick the story up at the end, where the cheap availability of red dyed clothing led to the decline of red as a preferred color. Once everyone could afford bright colors, of course it became vulgar.  The discussion in the last chapter of red as the color of “other”–non-white, or a class symbol–was really fascinating, and I think there’s a whole other book there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It won’t keep you up late, but it’s a fascinating read, and I can guarantee you will learn something you didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

Every Monday, I'll ridicule one or two of the worst woo-related items I find on eBay that night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get us started with this inaugural edition of Monday eBay, I bring you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/HAUNTED-VAMPIRE-SUPER-POWER-POTION-MAGICK-OF-UNDEAD_W0QQitemZ180339790813QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item180339790813&amp;amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;amp;_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A1%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50"&gt;Item number 180339790813: HAUNTED VAMPIRE SUPER POWER POTION-MAGICK OF UNDEAD!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From our old friend &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/09/ebay-roundup-moonstar7spirits.html"&gt;moonstar7spirits&lt;/a&gt;. This bitch is &lt;i&gt;all over&lt;/i&gt; eBay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SdBwhP296bI/AAAAAAAAAic/FKlb6MFCkfg/s1600-h/potion.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:300px;height:225px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SdBwhP296bI/AAAAAAAAAic/FKlb6MFCkfg/s400/potion.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;HAUNTED VAMPIRE SUPER POWER POTION-MAGICK OF UNDEAD!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gain Vampire POWERS! $ BACK GUARANTEE! LOOK AMAZING!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a soft spot in my heart for the vampire items. I suppose it stems mostly from the way they all dilute the awesomeness of the vampire worse then Stephanie Meyer on Quaaludes; none of them require that you die and resurrect as a member of the helldamned undead, none of them require your neck to be bitten, your blood to be drained, or anything otherwise physically uncomfortable, none of them require you to ingest any blood at any point, whether that of your sire or a steady diet of the vitae of the innocent. None of them in any way change your living habits, make you afraid of stakes, garlic, sunlight, or blessed objects, or even alter your attitude. Not only do you not become evil, you don't even go twelve rounds with that great beast ennui. EBay vampires still draw subsistence from others, but they do it in a way that doesn't require any messy victimization and, in fact, won't hurt them at all, thanks to the bastard stepchild of dipshit goth kids and the internet known as the "Energy Vampire."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, kids, all it takes to be a bona-fide vampire in the 21st century is an internet connection, a horridly depressing iTunes library, and Mom's eBay account. Those old blood-suckers are a thing of the past! They're relics, shuffling around their lame-ass coffins filled with gravedirt, reminiscing pathetically about the days when being a vampire &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt; something, when you had to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; to be a vampire, when vampires were &lt;i&gt;monsters&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No more! The information superhighway has &lt;i&gt;democratized vampirism!&lt;/i&gt; It has brought vampirism to the masses! Step right up and bring your social awkwardness and self-diagnosed depression!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to get an old-timer's perspective on this new wave of vampirism, today's Monday eBay will be narrated by Marcellus Eunorion, a 6th generation vampire who inhabits the Sanguine Falls Assisted Unliving Center for Elderly Bloodsuckers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;OFFERED FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY! VAMPIRE POWER POTION!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gain VAMPIRE Powers without actually becoming one!&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Whippersnappers these days. Why, back when &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was a neophyte, the only way to get powers without dyin' first was to find one of the kindred and have them make you a ghoul! And that was no trip to Disneyland, let me tell you! We would &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; those ghouls, and the blood made them feen like a crackhead! They didn't have none o' this free ride bullshit, let me tell you!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SOME OF THE POWERS YOU WILL GAIN:&lt;br&gt;Persuasive Magnetism- Attract other people to you simply by willing it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"They got it all wrong! Lucretius, come look at this! 'by willing it' my left fang! Haven't these people ever heard of raw animal magnetism? Why, I never had to will jack squat, and people were drawn to me anyway!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Superhuman Strength-Able to endure more without becoming tired.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Oh, you'll get tired eventually, whippersnappers, but you won't be allowed in Sanguine Falls, ya fakers!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Superhuman Speed-Faster thinking and body movements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"And what're ya gonna use it for, ya whiny little brats? Running from the school bully?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Enhanced Senses- Sight, sound, taste and smell drastically enhanced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"A lot of good it will do you, too, tracking prey like the box of Kraft your mama made you for dinner."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hypnotism-Hypnotize others by looking them in the eye.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Balderdash! When ya got raw animal magnetism, you don't need no kinda hokey hypnosis!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Damage Resistence-Ability to keep any type of physical or spiritual harm away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"What's all this about 'spiritual harm?' Only thing I was ever worried about was a sunrise or a stake through the ol' ticker. Crosses just burn, and that's physical enough."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Regeneration-Ability to heal old wounds and karmic interferance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"'Karmic interference?' What am I, the goldarned Buddha?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Animal mind Control-speak to animals telepathically.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"What's this now? Nonsense. You can't speak to animals. Influence them, will them to do your bidding, maybe, but speak telepathically? These kids and their "new age," I tell you, it's all hokum."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Shape Shifting-Shapeshift your thoughts into reality&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Now that don't even make sense. 'Shapeshift your thoughts into reality?' What does that even mean? Do you have any idea, Lucretius?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean sure, I turned into a bat from time to time. Days were, I knew a few guys could turn into wolves, even, but let me tell you, it was never easy. I'd be tryin' to echolocate for a week afterwards, every time. It was a complete pain."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Magical Abilities-Your natural psychic abilities drastically increased.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Psychic my foot. We were the &lt;i&gt;undead&lt;/i&gt;, damned for all eternity to a life preying on the innocent. Psychics are for sideshow carnivals and hippies. &lt;i&gt;We drank blood&lt;/i&gt;, people. Tore into the aorta with our fangs, felt the life of our victims pulse across our tongues and down our throats, held them as they died, slowly, by inches. None of this PT Barnum kiddie crap!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey, Lucretius, did I ever tell you about the time I ate a hippie? It was the summer of love..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This amazing Potion comes from Romania. Developed by Vampire Warlocks through a series of sacred rituals and processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"I been to Romania. Heck, I been there dozens of times since the early 11th century. Never did meet no Vampire Warlocks."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Potion is for EXTERNAL USE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE INGESTED! &lt;/blockquote&gt;"Where's the fun if you're not ingesting something?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With this auction you will receive: 1 dropper bottle (approx. 1 ounce) of Vampire Power potion and instructions for use. There is enough potion for hundreds of uses. It only takes a tiny drop to do the trick!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;"These days it's just take something for this, take something for that. No consequences, I tell ya! Just guilt-free vampirism! These kids don't appreciate nothin'!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This item comes with my MONEY BACK GUARANTEE! If you are not 100% pleased with your purchase, return it for a FULL REFUND.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Didn't nobody offer &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; a money back guarantee. And let me tell you, there were times I wasn't exactly 100% pleased with where I ended up."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When you purchase from Moonstar7spirits, you will not only receive an authentic Paranormal item, buzzing with energy, you will also receive a friend who will provide you ongoing support for as long as you need it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;"A friend from the internet. How convenient for her. Girlie, you ain't nobody's sire, that's for sure."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been a metaphysical seller on Ebay for over 2 years, but have been in the field for over 20 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Well, I been in the field for over 900 years, so I think I can tell when some lady is full of it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Law requirement states that I must post that readings, spells, and paranormal objects are for entertainment purposes only. You must be 18 years to purchase. &lt;/blockquote&gt;"Entertainment? &lt;i&gt;Entertainment?&lt;/i&gt; Lady, do I &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; entertained?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucretius, did you know that back during the American Revolution I had to walk fifteen miles in the snow just to eat a Redcoat? Uphill both ways! No foolin'! And when I did find one, he'd be so cold from those old-time New England snows that it was like havin' one-a those whatchamacallits--those Slurpee things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kids these days, I tell ya. Have they ever even &lt;i&gt;heard&lt;/i&gt; of the Vrykolakas? The Striga? Why, I'd bet a vial of elder vitae that they don't have a clue. They don't know where they came from, and they don't appreciate anything. Bah. I'm done. Lucretius! Ring the nurse! Somebody bring me a virgin!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, Marcellus.

In it, I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;listed the medical schools&lt;/a&gt; that had embraced pseudoscience through having started a CAM/IM program (a list desperately in need of an update). Moreover, we have also complained vociferously here about a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=336"&gt;clear effort&lt;/a&gt; on the part of advocates of faith-based medicine to infiltrate bastions of science-based medicine and to piggyback their agenda onto President Obama’s health care reform initiative in a clear political strategy to slip CAM/IM into any health care reform legislation as a form of “preventative medicine.” It’s all part of a multi-pronged strategy to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;claim popular and legal legitimacy in the absence of scientific legitimacy&lt;/a&gt;. At one point I even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=153"&gt;despaired&lt;/a&gt; because of the apparent success of half physician, half CAM huckster Dr. Andrew Weil at developing a CAM/IM curriculum that would be part of the mandatory training program in several family medicine residencies, while the rest of us watch &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;Senator Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt; try to promote pseudoscience in the halls of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since one of our newest co-bloggers, medical student &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=389"&gt;Tim Kreider&lt;/a&gt;, arrived, I’ve come to appreciate that medical schools and medical school curriculae are ground zero in the battle for science- and evidence-based medicine. Besides the infiltration of non-science-based modalities into the standard curriculum, another technique for making medical students believe that woo is equal to science is the student “campus CAM group” that invites, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=391"&gt;homeopaths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=395"&gt;naturopaths&lt;/a&gt; to give talks to medical students, too many of whom are too timid to challenge them on their pseudoscience. However, a reader of a “friend” of mine wrote me an e-mail that truly appalled me. In fact, it appalled not just me, but all of my co-bloggers who read it. It’s from a medical student in an American medical school. It’s not Harvard or a huge famous medical school. However, it is in medical schools like this one where the vast majority of medical students are trained in this country. If the infiltration of CAM/IM into medical schools continues in this way, we’ll have more than just “integrating” woo into the medical school curriculum from day one. We’ll have more tales like this; eventually, no one will find such tales unusual or even unacceptable anymore. The &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt; will no longer even shrug anymore. Such clinics will become simply the way medical students are educated. The following e-mail is de-identified, and I’ve edited it a bit to make as sure as I can that it is not traceable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Gorski,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a third-year medical student going through my clinical rotations. The particular outpatient site I’m at promotes woo. A few of the attendings practice acupuncture, conduct OMM [osteopathic manipulative medicine] clinics, and just started to offer cupping.  Sadly, most of the attendings recommend CAM therapies to patients, the residents incredulously try them out, and I know they’ve recently Matched fourth-year students because this program promotes woo. Laughingly, an attending actually lectured us on how to use acupuncture to control post-partum bleeding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’ve been assigned to participate in acupuncture clinic. I feel like a fraud to these patients and I despise being part of this sham.  I’ve already been asked “where I stand” on the issue of CAM.  As practicing physician I could choose to not hire someone who’d inflict CAM on patients, or as a professor I could fight to de-fund CAM departments, but as a student, I can’t speak up without the real risk of ruining my grade.  What do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose to use this email as part of a post, then please de-identify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, Student X deserves kudos for his realization that being asked to participate in an acupuncture clinic is in essence being asked to subject patients to unscientific, religion-based, placebo medicine that has never been convincingly shown to be more efficacious than a placebo for any condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I’m sure most readers of this blog will be as disturbed as I was to read this. At least I hope so. None of these therapies are science- or evidence-based. We’ve discussed why acupuncture is nothing more than placebo medicine on many occasions, although we haven’t discussed OMM at all. OMM is the aspect of osteopathic medicine that &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html"&gt;most resembles chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;, in that it postulates that realigning bones and muscles can somehow cure all manner of ills by physiologically dubious mechanisms. Although it’s still taught in most osteopathic medical schools, it’s more as a historical footnote, and few D.O.’s practice OMM anymore. That’s one reason why D.O.’s have over the years become virtually indistinguishable from M.D.’s, which to me is a very good thing indeed. In fact, the best surgical intensivist I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with is a D.O., and I’ve worked with excellent oncologists who are also D.O.’s. My overall impression is that science-based D.O.’s are somewhat embarrassed by these vestigial aspects of osteopathy, but clearly some osteopathic doctors still practice OMM. Some even practice a form of osteopathy called either “cranial osteopathy,” “craniosacral therapy,” “cranial therapy,” or similar names. Practitioners of these methods claim, as chiropracters claim for the spine, that the skull bones can be manipulated to relieve pain and remedy many other ailments. Worse, they claim that there is a “rhythm” in the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid and that diseases are characterized by changes in this rhythm, which can be used to diagnose many diseases, and that these abnormalities in this “rhythim” can be corrected by manipulating the skull. Student X didn’t mention whether any of these practitioners practiced craniosacral osteopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, before moving on to advice (such as it is) I have to point out that &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/cupping.html"&gt;cupping is pure quackery&lt;/a&gt;. It is a method from traditional Chinese medicine that involves heating the air within a cup and then placing it on the skin so that it is drawn into the cup as the air within cools. There are two varieties: dry cupping, which involves just the cupping, and “wet” cupping, which involves puncturing the skin before applying the cup over it. “Wet” cupping is said to “draw the toxins out” while all forms of cupping are claimed, like acupuncture, to “unblock” or “realign” the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; and thus restore health. It has no role in science-based medicine and should especially have no role in the education of medical students, which is why I was horrified that students anywhere in the U.S. are being taught about it as thought it were a legitimate therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should Student X do? Before I answer, let me briefly summarize what else I learned in my e-mail exchange with him. He’s already midway through the rotation; so leaving or changing rotations is not really an option. Also, he was not aware until recently that he would be assigned to the acupuncture clinic. Finally, he has assured me that this is the only site affiliated with his medical school where students are assigned to an outpatient rotation where, as he put it, the “woo runs free.” Being the cancer surgeon that I am, I can’t help but use an analogy here. It sounds to me as though the cancer needs to be cut out of this school before the “woo runs free” to the point where it invades and metastasizes elsewhere and endangers what Student X assures me is an otherwise very supportive, science- and evidence-based medical school. Indeed, I extensively searched the medical school’s website and was unable to find anything about the clinic described. All I found was that one faculty member has an NCCAM grant to study natural products and that one faculty member had finished an “integrative medicine fellowship” before joining the faculty. In that, at least on the surface, there would appear to be less woo at Student X’s school than now exists at my alma mater. Finally, Student X, although not going into the specialty of the Woo Clinic (which is what I will call it from now on) where he is currently rotating, does not feel that he can risk burning bridges, as he needs favorable evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to what to do. Every fiber of my being wants to tell Student X to go to the dean and complain forthwith about the infiltration of &lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt; into his medical school. However, I appreciate his situation, and do not wish to give him advice that’s going to land him in a world of hurt, even though fiber of my being also wants to try to get Student X to give me permisison to name names, to call out his medical school right here on this very blog. Unfortunately, Student X informs me that the dean censors anything said by medical students on blogs or online forums that might bring the medical school into disrepute. Were I to name his medical school and it ever became known who had complained to me, the consequences are likely to be unpleasant. Given that it is known who’s rotating at the Woo Clinic right now, it wouldn’t be too hard for his dean to figure out who had complained to me, especially if he had answered honestly the question of “where do you stand on CAM?” So, I will not reveal the medical school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, regardless of the dean, the very first step Student X needs to take now is to gather as much information as he can. He needs to document everything: every dubious therapy recommended, every credulous statement, every bit of advocacy of unscientific therapy, and every instance of outright quackery. If the clinic has fliers on various CAM/IM modalities that it hands out to patients, he should collect them as evidence. If the clinic has published handouts, outlines, and notes that it uses to teach medical students about CAM/IM (particularly cupping), he should save those, because if he ultimately does complain he will need as much ammunition as he can get. This very blog and various other sites, such as QuackWatch, can provide material and scientific studies showing how discredited these therapies are. If this all blows up, more documentation is better to cover his behind. What critics of unscientific practices in medical often find out is that most of the faculty has essentially zero idea what is actually being done and taught. When they are informed of exactly what “cupping” is, for instance, they are often appalled that such woo is being taught in their medical school to medical students. Ditto reiki, homeopathy, and a lot of the other “woo-iest of the woo” that falls under the CAM/IM rubric. The best tool to educate &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt;, who refuse to believe that anyone would believe, much less teach, such mystical pseudoscientific nonsense is to show them exactly what is being taught to students in the very words of the CAM/IM practitioners. That is often more than damning enough evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is for Student X to find out if there are other students who agree with him and then to hook up with them. Indeed, he should go beyond that and find out if there are other faculty members in the department to which that outpatient clinic belongs who are concerned about the woo being taught to the medical students alongside scientific medicine. In fact, he should go beyond even that and find out whether there are any faculty in the medical school, period, who are proponents of science-based medicine and willing to take a look at the situation. In other words, he needs to find first those who are not &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt; first and network with them. That has to be done before there is any hope of changing the minds of the shruggies. The dean could easily ignore the voice of one lone medical student, but he could not so easily ignore the voices of several medical students if they are backed up by even a handful of faculty–or even just one senior influential faculty member. Ideally, he should seriously consider writing up a letter of complaint to the dean and getting as many signatures as he can on it. Having discussed this case with my cobloggers, I believe I can say with some confidence that all of us would also sign such a letter; indeed, we’d help Student X draft it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve thought about this case over the weekend, I completely understand Student X’s reticience about speaking out. Quite frankly, I don’t know if I would have had the intestinal fortitude to have spoken out about an issue like this when I was in medical school. Fortunately for me, that was over 20 years ago, and the infiltration of CAM/IM had not yet become an issue. Indeed, I don’t remember its even being on the radar screen back then. In that, I and other physicians of my generation were fortunate; we weren’t put to the test. However, now, if we are not yet being tested, we soon will be. With NCCAM providing the cloak of undeserved legitimacy to these modalities, it is hard to speak out without being labeled as “close-minded” or even “bigoted,” given how many of these modalities are part of traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic, or indigenous populations, usually mixed in with the usual appeal to ancient wisdom, a logical fallacy if ever there was one. These charges are a powerful blunt instrument to beat the critics of CAM/IM over the head with, which is why we must acquire thick skins to handle them. My counterargument is to ask why ancient Chinese or Indian medicines should be held to a lower standard as far as evidence goes than ancient Western medicine, like bloodletting and purging with toxic metals, which were ultimately abandoned based on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even as understanding as I am about Student X’s position, I’m going to point out that silence is acquiescence. If no one speaks out, the problem will only continue and likely get worse. The woo will spread and metastasize to other areas of Student X’s medical school. Unfortunately, speaking out can have consequences, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s that CAM/IM infiltration thrives best when it’s under the radar. When the light is shined on CAM practitioners in academia and exactly what they do, they usually do not like it, and, unfortunately, their first reaction is often to try to attack the messenger. However, it is on the frontlines, such as the clinic where Student X is currently assigned, where the battle for science-based medicine in academia will be lost or won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why we at SBM will help any medical student who asks us in whatever way we are able. If that includes writing letters, talking to program directors or deans, or even (if it can be pulled off), arranging for one or more of us to come to give talks at medical schools where students are being subjected to rotations teaching them pseudoscientific medicine along with scientific medicine, then we will do that when we can if asked. If it consists only of advising medical students who are science-based and object to the infiltration of pseudoscience into their medical schools on tactics to slow down or stop the CAM/IM train, we will do that as well. We also ask any faculty of medical schools who will support us in this effort to contact me or Steve. You can either do so by publicly leaving a comment below or e-mailing either of us at the e-mail addresses in the Contact tab above. If it’s feasible, you could even become more active by attending the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=426"&gt;Science-Based Medicine conference&lt;/a&gt; in July and networking with like-minded physicians and scientists. There’s nothing like a little face time to build relationships and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now conclude with a request. First, of my fellow SBM co-bloggers, I request your input and that you chime in with your advice to Student X. Second, of our readers, I request the same thing. I also open the comments to any medical students or faculty who may have had a similar experience to that of Student X. It would be better if you used your real name, but I understand if you, like Student X, don’t feel comfortable doing that; you may register under a pseudonym if you like. We at SBM will never “out” you unless you give us permission to do so. Look at this post as a springboard to begin the process of organizing. We at SBM want this blog to be more than just a blog; we want it to be a clearinghouse, the beginning of a movement, a hub where like-minded supporters of science- and evidence-based medicine can gather. The CAM/IM revolution has gone frighteningly far; it’s long past time for the counterrevolution for science- and evidence-based medicine to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Yale study, researchers created five versions of animated children's games such as 'peek-a-boo' and 'pat-a-cake' where points of light marked movement, each with sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other half of the screen, the same animation was presented upside down and in reverse, but with the same audio as the upright version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that, normally, children's attention is drawn to such changes from around eight months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the children in the study, 21 had autism spectrum disorders, 16 had developmental problems that were not related to ASDs, and 39 were developing normally. While the latter two clearly preferred to look at the upright versions of the animations, the children with ASDs "showed no preference and looked backwards and forwards between the two halves of the screen." But when a cartoon of motion clearly keyed to sound was shown---an animation of "pat-a-cake," with the figure clapping his hands repeatedly---the children on the spectrum showed a preference for the upright animation 66% of the time. As noted in &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20090329/autism-new-clue-to-earlier-detection"&gt;WedMD&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klin explains that within a few days after birth, typically developing children prefer watching biological motion -- the movement of living beings, such as their parents -- and that preference is an important survival skill and a building block for relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Klin's group found that autistic children were more interested in "nonsocial contingencies," which are synchronicities that don't have any social meaning -- like two balls colliding and making a sound, or a stone falling when someone drops it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be helpful to know if other animations evoked the same preferences in children on the spectrum in contrast to typically developing children and children with delays not related to ASDs. It does seem to me that Charlie, when an infant and toddler, was much more likely to be attentive to a repetitive sound or motion. The pairing of both of these would have especially increased the likelihood of him attending: I'm thinking particularly of 9 month or so old Charlie sitting in one of those Boppy pillows in a red outfit, on the floor of the room Jim used to write and lay out his research files in a house we were renting in St. Louis, back in 1998. We liked to joke that it was "Boys Only Club" or some such in the room and one night I "snuck" in to find Jim sitting on the floor across from Charlie, eager to show me how Charlie had the biggest grin and bright eyes when Jim tossed a soft ball up to the ceiling. The ball made a soft &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt; and then fell to the carpet, and Jim picked up the ball and tossed it up again, all with Charlie watching the whole process and laughing at the sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the sight, but especially the motion, the &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt;, the rise and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I remember the whole scene so well is, or must be, because (not that we realized this then as we do now, in hindsight) it was not that easy to get Charlie's attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Charlie, when very young and throughout his life, has had a limited attention span for any cartoon or animations, so I'm not sure how he would respond to a test in which he was to watch a cartoon. Charlie's never been captivated by Disney cartoons, resulting in me admitting to a group of people on Sunday that I've never seen &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;. I do know some of the songs by heart ("&lt;em&gt;Under the sea&lt;/em&gt;.....''----ok, that song alone is grounds for a whole other post.....) which attests, somewhat, to Charlie's always being more, if not mostly, attentive to sound, from his babyhood until today.&lt;/p&gt;

The short version is that a flawed study that tested using Lexapro that neglected to report a rather important comparison that would have changed the conclusion to finding no difference between cognitive therapy and Lexapro in relieving the symptoms of depression after a stroke resulted in a complaint by Dr. Jonathan Leo of Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, TN. Dr. Leo wrote a letter pointing inquiring about the "oversight" in the paper, while at the same time inquiring privately of the editors of JAMA about an undisclosed conflict of interest (COI) of the corresponding author that he had discovered with a simple Google search. It turned out that that author had been on the speakers' bureau of Forest Laboratories, the manufacturers of Lexapro. Taking the lapse in reporting of a result that would have undermined the paper's conclusion that Lexapro was the most efficacious means of treating post-stroke depression with the undisclosed COI, the whole paper smelled fishy. After five months, having heard nothing, Dr. Leo wrote a letter to BMJ "outing" the undisclosed COI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? In a blatant display of intimidation more suited to the "guys named Guido" that she likes to joke about than to the editor of a major journal, Catherine DeAngelis, editor-in-chief of JAMA came down on Dr. Leo like a ton of bricks, with the assistance of her deputy Phil Fontanarosa. Her call to the dean was along the lines of, "Nice university ya got here; be a shame if something bad happened to it." Meanwhile, Fontanarosa's call to Dr. Leo was along the lines of, "You'll never work in this town again," as in threatening to ban him from JAMA for life. Now it appears that even the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123819137827260883.html"&gt;American Medical Association is fed up&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_ama_investigates_catherine_deangelis.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_ama_investigates_catherine_deangelis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/x_4EiwkbQuM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238386182768"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/privileging_belief.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d7af76f8b89e3059</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Privileging belief</title><published>2009-03-30T04:11:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T04:11:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/As0EauEq8B8/privileging_belief.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/privileging_belief.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A horrible little &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032801936.html?hpid=moreheadlines"&gt;cult in Baltimore committed an ugly crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…they denied a 16-month-old boy food and water because he did not say &amp;quot;Amen&amp;quot; at mealtimes. After he died, they prayed over his body for days, expecting a resurrection, then packed it into a suitcase with mothballs. They left it in a shed in Philadelphia, where it remained for a year before detectives found it last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child's mother, Ria Ramkissoon, and others are on trial for murder, reasonably enough. Here's the kicker, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrists who evaluated Ramkissoon at the request of a judge concluded that she was not criminally insane. Her attorney, Steven Silverman, said the doctors found that her beliefs were indistinguishable from religious beliefs, in part because they were shared by those around her.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;b&gt;She wasn't delusional, because she was following a religion&lt;/b&gt;," Silverman said, describing the findings of the doctors' psychiatric evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. Why should the religion label excuse delusional beliefs?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/privileging_belief.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/As0EauEq8B8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238385407008"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/29/freeman-thinking/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59aa895ee6b69203</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><category term="News"/><category term="Science and Society"/><title type="html">Freeman Thinking</title><published>2009-03-30T03:48:34Z</published><updated>2009-03-30T03:48:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/29/freeman-thinking/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s New York Times magazine had a long &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1"&gt;feature on Freeman Dyson&lt;/a&gt;, loosely based on his skepticism about global warming.  Dyson, one of the founders of modern relativistic quantum field theory, is skeptical about a lot of things, as a matter of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman spent two weeks at our department at UC Davis last year, gave a public lecture, a colloquium, and was available for a number of very stimulating conversations.  We had lunch with him one day, and pressed him on his taste for smaller, lighter, faster experiments in particle physics, as opposed to the dominant large collider experiments such as those at the LHC, the Tevatron, and LEP.  In his kind way, Freeman said it was all fine with him that such things took place, but that he simply preferred the more table-top variety, where the individual experimenter could control the variables and the measurement at hand.  I do too, but as the NYT article quoted Weinberg as saying, “get over it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, about global warming.  I have to say that my own skeptical streak doesn’t simply cave to the present dominant stream of thought on this issue either.  As scientists we need to continue to question all of it.  It seems to me that the dominant paradigm can be summarized in a number of straightforward notions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The earth’s climate is in an overall warming trend.  The average global surface temperature, and the average surface temperature of the oceans, is increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The root cause of the increase in global surface temperature is in large part, or even dominantly, due to the increase of the level of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane in the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The dominant source of the excess greenhouse gases is human activity: industry, transportation, agriculture and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If the global surface temperature continues to increase, then drastic and devastating consequences will ensue due to the melting of polar ice and the rising of sea levels, desertification of huge swaths of land, increased frequency and intensity of devastating storms, and other effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; By changing our means of energy production and ceasing the use of fossil carbon fuels as soon as possible, there is still a chance that we can evade the above ill effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own skepticism increases linearly as we go down this list.  The first two items, that the global surface temperature is increasing, and that it is due to greenhouse gases, seems to be incontrovertible.  The extensive measurements and correlations reported by the IPCC are rather hard to refute at this stage.  (It is a very great setback for this science that NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090224-nasa-satellite-crash.html"&gt;crashed on launch&lt;/a&gt; last month, or we would have gotten the mother lode of data on these questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the dominant source of excess greenhouse gases seems incontrovertible as well, though here the climate models start to differ about the sources and sinks of global CO2, methane, and other gases.  And, as the climate changes, not all the models can possibly predict all the outcomes.  An example: in 2005, the Amazon experienced a drought which turned the region, with over half the world’s rainforest, from a &lt;a href="http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=351"&gt;net carbon sink to a net carbon source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Was the drought predicted by any (or all) of the models?  Was the net effect on carbon predicted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best models must combine physics, oceanography, chemistry, and biology all at once.  Has it really been done yet?  (Enlighten us all, gentle readers, if you know!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the last two: the negative effects.  We dwell on these.  Clearly ocean levels will rise rapidly in our lifetime if Greenland melts, and it appears to be melting &lt;a href="http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=351"&gt;faster than expected by the models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
That would be a bad thing, especially here in the Central Valley of California.  My house is 15 meters above sea level, and a lot of the roads around here are lower than that.   If Greenland melts, sea level will rise over 7 meters.  Well, the Central Valley used to be a sea, and it will be again some day, no doubt.   And with so much of the world’s population living so close to the sea, this is a serious, serious concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am less convinced about the severity and frequency of storms with global warming, but my mind is open to being convinced by good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, can we do anything about it?  The whole question of whether we’ve reached a “tipping point” seems to be hot right now.  The answer lies in the climate models, so let’s keep our skepticism alive here.   We don’t understand what causes ice age cold and warm spells.  When those are in the models, and we can post-dict the previous glaciations, I’ll start to believe the models.  The oceanic thermohaline circulation seems to be key here, but how?  What about the Milankovich cycle?  Chaotic perturbations in the solar system?  Dust lanes in the Milky Way?  No one said this would be easy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how soon could we wean ourselves from carbon, even if we wanted to?  Oil may run out, but there is a crapload of natural gas and coal left to burn.  Remember, “drill, baby, drill!” is the same as “burn, baby, burn!”  And we have a lot left to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced at all that in 10 years we can &lt;a href="http://www.repoweramerica.org/"&gt;“Repower America”&lt;/a&gt; and eliminate fossil fuels.  And the rest of the world certainly won’t.  That doesn’t mean we should not try, should not do research into new, non-carbon-based energy sources, expand our use of renewable, clean energy.  We should!  I am just very skeptical that it could be done even if it became the #1 national priority.  It seems to me to violate physics itself, not to mention basic economic facts.  Twenty years?  Thirty?   Eventually it will be clear to every one that we don’t really have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh…Freeman, what’s the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

So, it seemed like a good time to document some recent developments in the Free-Ride garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm presenting six photos from the garden for you to identify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common name is fine -- no need to provide the Linnaean binomial unless you really feel like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I'm not asking you to identify these plants because I've forgotten what I've planted.  (Not this time, anyway.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your identifications will germinate (harden-off?  compost?) in comment moderation until Monday night (9 PM PST, to be precise), so there's no need to worry that your comment will spoil the fun for others who want to guess.&lt;/li&gt;

Monckton dismisses the problem of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by claiming that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels were much higher in the pre-Cambrian, and that the stuff is just "plant food".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is the material plants take up from the atmosphere to make sugar. It&amp;#39;s also a greenhouse gas. So? And what is this stuff about &amp;quot;saving the world&amp;quot;? It&amp;#39;s like the two of them are babbling about problems and arguments that no one is making — and we get more when Shimkus explain how he knows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not a problem. It's because the Bible is the inerrant word of his god, and he knows god isn't going to end the world with global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earth will end only when God declares its time to be over.  Man will not destroy this earth.  This earth will not be destroyed by a flood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could one of you voters out there in Illinois take Shimkus aside and explain to him with short, simple words and short, simple sentences that global warming isn't going to destroy the world? It's not an argument anyone is making. It could very well make the world more tropical, and it could be of some advantage to certain kinds of plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, please note: human beings aren&amp;#39;t plants (well, most of us, anyway — John Shimkus does seem to share some similarities with root vegetables). The concern with global warming is &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; that will cause economic disruption and environmental disturbances and damage to places we like…like cities. Honestly, if nations collapse, we know that algae will still thrive. We just happen to generally take the side of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you might let him know that the Bible is mostly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a whole bunch of cool events of various sorts around the world.  Ray Jayawardhana at Toronto started the year off with a great ad campaign on Toronto busses and elsewhere called &lt;a href="http://www.di.utoronto.ca/coolcosmos/"&gt;Cool Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are a couple of examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.di.utoronto.ca/coolcosmos/img/bigbang.gif" alt="bigbang" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.di.utoronto.ca/coolcosmos/img/longday.gif" alt="longday" width="100%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pretty cool to see that while you’re standing on a bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this week starts &lt;a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/"&gt;100 hours of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, running April 2–5.  The focus is a worldwide marathon of amateur astronomers watching the sky, culminating in a star party during the final 24 hours, which coincides with the 3rd annual International Sidewalk Astronomy night.  If you have a telescope and know how to use it, get out there!  And if you don’t, now’s your chance to find one!  Astronomical observatories will be participating via &lt;a href="http://100hoursofastronomy.org/program/75-live-24-hour-research-observatory-webcast"&gt; Around the World in 80 Telescopes&lt;/a&gt;, which will be a live webcast starting on Mauna Kea (with Gemini, Subaru, UKIRT, Keck, CFHT, SMA, CSO all participating) and then heading west until it gets back around to Lick and Palomar 24 hours later.  In addition to the webcast, you can also follow &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/100Hours"&gt;100 Hours on twitter&lt;/a&gt;    Impressively, in New York City, they managed to get the park lights turned off at 8pm this friday for their &lt;a href="http://www.moonbeam.net/InwoodAstronomy/events-100hours.shtml"&gt;star party&lt;/a&gt; — great opportunity to see a dark(er) night in NYC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case 100 days isn’t enough, there is also a podcast called &lt;a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/"&gt;365 days of astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, which has a daily podcast from a variety of sources and on a wide range of astronomy related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is also a blog, &lt;a href="http://www.cosmicdiary.org/"&gt;Cosmic Diary&lt;/a&gt; which includes bloggers from ESA, ESO, JAXA, and NASA, so you can hear about the life of professional astronomers all over.  Check em out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ve missed some of the most interesting events, so feel free to leave them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

On the pleasant list was a trip to Salem, my state's capital, to witness the signing of &lt;a href="http://governor.oregon.gov/Gov/pdf/eo0907.pdf"&gt;the executive order (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; creating the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Here's the &lt;a href="http://ocdd.org/images/uploads/Executive_Order_Press_Release11.doc"&gt;press release (DOC)&lt;/a&gt; and some video and print &lt;a href="http://kdrv.com/page/101560"&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/oregon_autism_committee_autistics_now_included"&gt;wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;, I have a lot of hope for true inclusion of autistic individuals on the policy level in Oregon based on the speedy correction to the town hall invitations to include autistic people, and on the addition of the self-advocate position on the Commission.  Being invited to the signing last week also gave me hope as, based on my positive interactions with all involved, I was invited not as a token autie but as a citizen who had successfully participated in the policy making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have hope as well because Oregon has had a good &lt;a href="http://www.peoplefirstsv.com/people_first_history.htm"&gt;history of self-advocacy&lt;/a&gt; and currently has strong &lt;a href="http://asksaal.org/"&gt;self-advocate organizations&lt;/a&gt; with members who participate actively in &lt;a href="http://asksaal.org/policy/index.html"&gt;policy making&lt;/a&gt;.  Self-advocates are also included seriously (as in, important council positions) on the policy level of the &lt;a href="http://ocdd.org/index.php/ocdd/section/11/"&gt;Oregon Council on Developmental Disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autism, particularly for adults in Oregon, typically falls under the developmental or intellectual disability umbrella, the self-advocates currently included at the policy level of DD/ID programs and in DD/ID legislation tend to not be autistic; we are vastly underrepresented still.  Hopefully that is starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:45 AM in the temporary ceremonial office (the permanent one was still under repairs after &lt;a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/august302008/fire_083008.php"&gt;a fire&lt;/a&gt;), I listened to Representative Edwards and Governor Kulongoski each give short, respectful speeches about the new Committee.  I watched Edwards' autistic son play peek-a-boo with the state government staff.  I remembered to take off my hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this whole thing started, I had never been a direct participant in policy before.  I had never been to a town hall meeting, had never spoken up to a council or to legislators, and certainly had never thought that I could influence policy at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Kulongoski sign the order, which in some small way I've been told I did in fact influence, into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for autistic self-advocates to make a difference in policy.  And we do not need to be experts at politics to do so--showing up to public meetings and speaking, typing, signing, or showing our ideas, thoughts, and needs can make an impact.  If it's not possible to do this without assistance, seek out &lt;a href="http://www.sabeusa.org/nationalchapters.html"&gt;local self advocacy organizations&lt;/a&gt; which provide direct support to enable us to attend policy sessions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Science is increasingly being produced, discussed and deliberated with cooperative tools by web users and without the institutionalized presence of scientists. "Popular science" or "Citizen science" are two of the traditional ways of defining science grassroots produced outside the walls of laboratories. But the internet has changed the way of collecting and organising the knowledge produced by people - peers - who do not belong to the established scientific community. In this issue we want to discuss:

&lt;p&gt;- How web tools are changing and widening this way of participating in the production of scientific knowledge. Do this increase in participation consist in a real shift towards democratizing science or on the contrary is merely a rhetoric which do not affect the asymmetrical relationships between citizens and institutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The ways in which both academic and private scientific institutions are appropriating this knowledge and its value. Do we need a new model to understand these ways of production and appropriation? Are they part of a deeper change in productive paradigms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to collect both theoretical contributions and research articles which address for example case studies in social media and science, peer production, the role of private firms in exploiting web arenas to collect scientific/medical data from their costumers, online social movements challenging communication incumbents, web tools for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested authors should submit an extended abstract of no more than 500 words (in English) to the issue editor by May 15, 2009. We will select three to five papers for inclusion in this special issue. Abstracts should be sent to the JCOM's editorial office (jcom-eo@jcom.sissa.it) by email and NOT via the regular submission form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may remember that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/09/science_art_education_communic.php" title=""&gt;mentioned this journal before&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, if you &lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/search?SearchableText=zivkovic" title=""&gt;look closely&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find an article by me, and two articles that mention me in there - all written during or right after my visit to Trieste last year.

The disproportion between these numbers is a concern, and one possible explanation may be that the science literacy among the general public is low. Perhaps Sherry Seethaler's new book &lt;em&gt;'Lies, Damn Lies, and Science'&lt;/em&gt; can be a useful contribution in raising the  science literacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is about science in general and about how science often is &lt;em&gt;miscommunicated&lt;/em&gt; in the media. It addresses a range of issues, such as how statistics often is misused, how scientific progress is made in general, that the 'scientific method' is not always as straightforward as one might like to think, the influence of stake-holders, the importance of knowing the context of the research, relationships between science and policy, and ploys designed to bypass logic. Many of the points made in the book are probably well known for the RC readership - albeit used in different situations to the case studies discussed in the book. There is also some discussion about AGW, amongst other subjects.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One little paradox is that the book claims (p. xx)  that it will empower people of all ages and educational backgrounds to think critically about science-related issues and make well-balanced decisions about them. To me, that sounds like a big promise, and after having read the book, I started to wonder whether that statement is just the sort of claims it tries to make people become more skeptical about? Or maybe Seethaler really did succeed after all - because I saw how the arguments in her book could be applied to this promise? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book touches on AGW, and does in general do a good job in my opinion. However, I cannot avoid bringing up some small details to pick at: The description of the greenhouse effect is not quite correct, as the reader gets the impression that it involves reflecting infrared radiation back to space (p. 84). That is not the case, as the energy from the sun lies mainly in the visible spectrum, and the infra red light from the Earth is a product from the absorption of the sunlight and a re-emittance due to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law"&gt;Planck's law&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point that I think is that the book discusses the controversy around AGW, but this can be a bit misleading. If you look in the climatological field, you may not see much controversy, but if you search the web, you may see something that looks like one. But I think that this controversy to a large extent is constructed out of thin air, an impression I feel is supported by Doran and Zimmermann's, &lt;em&gt;Eos&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that &lt;em&gt;'Lies, Damn Lies, and Science'&lt;/em&gt; has much in common with the older book &lt;em&gt;'Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics'&lt;/em&gt;, and that they try to convey similar take-home messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'Lies, Damn Lies, and Science&lt;/em&gt;' gives a nice collection of anecdotes and general tips. The book has a nice index and overview, so it's easy to find your way through the book. I think the book is very useful for a lot of people -  especially students, scientists, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, and the voters.&lt;/p&gt;

You can train your body’s immune system to fight a virus, but then the virus changes shape and can maneuver past your defenses. What’s new here is that scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have found a stable part of the flu virus, something that doesn’t change over time. Target that, and blammo: dead virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that simple, of course, and will take time to develop. But a lot of independent scientists are calling this a breakthrough. And even better, it looks like this stable component is in lots of different flu viruses, including the avian flu and the Spanish flu (which caused millions of deaths in the 1910s and was a major reason World War I ended; it killed a lot of people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if this works out, it’ll be an incredible medical breakthrough. But that’s what medical science does: it keeps moving along, doing the needed research, finding the way medical problems actually occur, and then seeking out solutions. it doesn’t always work, but it learns from its mistakes. And the next thing you know, smallpox is gone. Polio is gone. Ignore it, or worse, fight it, and measles crops back up and starts killing kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice between science and nonsense is clear. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

Leading the list is “legacy loans,” “legacy securities,” and “legacy costs,” referring to those badly collateralized loans, mortgages, and problems of auto companies that we are hearing so much about in reports of the recent Federal Bank Rescue Plan. Linguist George Lakoff says “legacy” typically means something positive, while positive these financial instruments are not. Other current expressions, such as “troubled assets” (see the Troubled Asset Relief Program),  “securitization” (redistribution of bad loans), and “sub-prime” (non-prime loans) come under similar fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;he’ll want to spend it on a fancy hotel room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;When he gets to his hotel room,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;he’ll feel happy and want to celebrate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;so you’ll take him clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the club, he’ll dance . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;. . . and have some drinks . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;. . . and talk to girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those girls will be a hooker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="0327092sham2" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0327092sham2-150x150.jpg" alt="0327092sham2" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right;padding-left:150px"&gt;He’ll buy her a few drinks . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . and she’ll offer to show him a good time in his hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;He’ll pay her $1000 and take her back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Once they get to the hotel, they’ll start to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;They’ll drink a little champagne . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;. . . and he’ll try to kiss her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;When he tries to kiss her, she’ll bite his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;To get her to stop biting, he’ll punch the hooker in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;She’ll punch back then run away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;The police will come . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;. . . and arrest the ShamWow guy and the hooker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="0327092sham1awm" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0327092sham1awm-150x150.jpg" alt="0327092sham1awm" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;Then everyone will have to go to jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So you’ll have to go to the jail to bail him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Once he’s out, he’ll see some pretty girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll remind him of the club he was at the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;He’ll remember the hotel room . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;. . . and convince you to give him more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you who haven’t heard, Vice Offer (aka &lt;a href="http://shamwow.com"&gt;ShamWow&lt;/a&gt; Guy, &lt;a href="http://slapchop.com"&gt;Slapchop &lt;/a&gt;Guy or Headset Vince) was arrested early Thursday morning for punching a hooker in his hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://slapchop.com"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.slapchop.com/images/slapchop_features.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="212"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not too long ago I &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5490"&gt;wrote a post about Headset Vince&lt;/a&gt;. I told you that he’s not just the ShamWow pitchman, but an up and coming superhero. He not only invented ShamWow, he is selling them to raise money to fight the Church of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also told you that he was using &lt;em&gt;all the profits&lt;/em&gt; from the sale of Shamwows to fund his fight against them. I don’t know if that’s still true. Maybe it is. I mean, he certainly has overhead costs. Some of those costs include paying his employees… and he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of his own employees. It’s only fair that he pays himself some sort of living wage. And in this economy, part of that wage absolutely must provide for $750 hotel rooms and $1000 prostitutes. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no matter how many of those hotel rooms and hooker nights go exactly as planned, sometimes, as Vince knows from working in customer service and sales, transactions can go awry… and end up in the news… and embarrass the people trying to convince the world that Vince is a good guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, there is no official “her side of the story” from Sasha Harris, the young lady with whom Vince sought biblical relations that evening. She refused to answer &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0327092sham1.html"&gt;police or media questions&lt;/a&gt;, except to say that she is considering filing a lawsuit against our beloved enemy of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince’s side of the story is that he was at a social gathering establishment where he met a comely young lady. After some conversation, she invited him back to his hotel room for a night cap (I believe the term the kids are using these days is “straight sex, $1000″). Enchanted, awestruck and hypnotized by her beauty, he handed her a giant stack of $20 bills.&lt;img title="hookers" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hookers-250x300.jpg" alt="hookers" width="250" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hotel room became like the Garden of Eden, only Vince was Eve, and the beautiful young temptress was both the serpent and the fruit. She beckoned him to taste her sweet lips. When he did, she tried to bite his fucking tongue off so he punched her in the face repeatedly until she let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there’s not enough information to pass any judgment on whether Vince was in the right or in the wrong. It’s not really okay to go around punching hookers in the face, but I’m definitely in favor of punching people wherever necessary if they are using their teeth to amputate parts of your face. It’s a self defence move I will now dub the ChopSlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vince was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harris was taken to the hospital. She had “lacerations all over her face including several facial fractures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both parties were released without being formally charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vince was, in fact, not in a great mood all day after slapping his troubles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don’t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to continue biting someone else’s tongue while getting your face broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harris is a Scientologist fair gaming Vince&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harris was hired by Billy Mays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harris bit Vince because he insisted she had to “Say ‘wow’ every time”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vince actually told her she was going to love his nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make $1000 a night in a city with an 87% foreclosure rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Miami actually has an 87% foreclosure rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Augustus Porter, my wise Facebook friend, “I say let he who has not had a drunken brawl with a hooker cast the first stone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Amen, Augustus; amen, bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238346260499"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a95ef1f4dc770e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Verses, Foiled Again!</title><published>2009-03-29T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/humor/bibleverse.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Politician cites the wrong verse as his favorite Biblical passage.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238344317812"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33112888.post-717983338315270621">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86526f89f8d46eb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Daily Mail links White on White violence to Scary Muslims.</title><published>2009-03-29T15:21:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T15:21:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/2009/03/daily-mail-links-white-on-white.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Magic Darts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238344268588"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5682938494090184478">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4ff7edc47ae3927</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Don McLeroy, Creationist Dentist</title><published>2009-03-29T16:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T16:30:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/don-mcleroy-creationist-dentist.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5682938494090184478/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5682938494090184478" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> This has already been posted on Panda&amp;#39;s Thumb and elsewhere but it deserves to be seen by everyone.

An AP article by William Kates about the event has been printed in dozens of places; here I'll quote from &lt;a href="http://www.ithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/200903270525/NEWS01/903270303"&gt;the version&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Ithaca Journal&lt;/em&gt; (hat tip to Marilyn Martin). (Strunk taught at Cornell and White went to college there, so it's no surprise that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; has a story. There are stories by other writers in the &lt;a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/March09/StrunkWhite.html"&gt;Cornell Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2009/03/27/elements-style-celebrates-50-years"&gt;Cornell Daily Sun&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
S&amp;amp;W began life in 1918 as a brief writing guide Strunk wrote for the students in his English composition classes, available from the campus bookstore (now available on-line &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), while White&amp;#39;s 1959 expansion and revision was more ambitious. S&amp;amp;W rapidly became the premier American guide to grammar and usage, selling more than 10 million copies (in various editions) over the years. The reverence attached to the book has always been something of  a mystery to me (and to several other &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=Strunk"&gt;Language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=001269089414569134552%3Aqvjtfauf7ou&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=strunk&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Loggers&lt;/a&gt;), but there's no denying that many people are passionately attached to it; more on this below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strunk&amp;#39;s apparently modest ambitions — &amp;quot;This book is intended for use in English courses in which the practice of composition is combined with the study of literature. It aims to give in brief space the principal requirements of plain English style.&amp;quot; (from the introduction) — were allied with the advocacy of a style for all writing (the &amp;quot;plain English style&amp;quot; above) and with an often bald assertion of rules (on &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, which has excited so much interest on Language Log: "In the meaning &lt;em&gt;nevertheless,&lt;/em&gt; not to come first in its sentence or clause.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;W continues most of these features, including the focus on a small number of rules, so it is by no means an encyclopedia of grammar and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Barron says in the Kates article that Strunk and White's success is the result of an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;emphasis on plain style being preferable to more ornate kind of writing. Simple rather than complex. Native rather than foreign. Active rather than passive. Verbal rather than nominal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other commenters take the very brevity of S&amp;amp;W (and the 1918 Strunk before it) to be one of its great virtues. Here&amp;#39;s high school English teacher Sharon Gross, quoted by Kates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strunk's focus on usage and composition in a few concise rules helps the novice writer quickly find a comfort zone with his own writing;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross goes on to praise "the clarity and delivery of Strunk's own rules" and to claim that a good writer "still values the elements Strunk introduced in 1918."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plain style certainly antedates Strunk; you can see it in the writing of Emerson, Lincoln, and Twain, for example. But Strunk might have been an early explicit advocate of the symbolic virtues of the style: &amp;quot;vigor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;directness&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;boldness&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;forcefulness&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;liveliness&amp;quot;, and the like. S&amp;amp;W continued the theme, and I suspect that these symbolic virtues helped make S&amp;amp;W such a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strunk claimed to be merely giving advice to students in composition classes, but what he says frequently sounds like it's supposed to apply to all writing (without regard for the purpose of the writing or the nature of the audience), as in this stern passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kates&amp;#39;s piece ends with a now-routine reference to putatively declining writing skills –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with instant and text messaging eroding writing skills, Strunk and White is possibly needed even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's only at the very end of the article you discover this has nothing to do with the people in the picture. After most people will probably have clicked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;A case can be made that I'm overstating here, but It's just more (circumstantial) evidence why we can't have a civil discussion about our military actions and religion. One of the reasons it is so hard to criticise Islam without appearing like a racist dick is because the Daily Mail and the like take every opportunity to turn complex shades gray into sellable chunks of black and white with Muslims as the cartoon grade evil baddies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;To be fare there is no reason why the white attackers couldn't be Muslim. I just make the assumption they weren't because then the Mails story would probably been about how Islam is corrupting the Good Honest White People That Won The War. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Maybe one day the Daily Mail will actually commission an article about why our military actions have lead people of all skin and hair colour, who believe differing (but equally stupid) things to reprehensible acts of violence.

Richard Lynn, the fellow infamous for trying to link intelligence and race, is in the news again, this time trying to &lt;a href="http://channels.isp.netscape.com/homerealestate/package.jsp?name=fte/intelligenceandbelief/intelligenceandbelief&amp;amp;floc=NI-slot1b"&gt;claim a causal relationship between atheism and intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why should fewer academics believe in God than the general population? I believe it is simply a matter of the IQ," Lynn told the Times Higher Education magazine. "Academics have higher IQs than the general population. Several Gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher IQs tend not to believe in God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always so tempted to simply accept this kind of claim — it&amp;#39;s wonderfully self-serving, obviously — but I can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve known lots of religious people who really are brilliant, and I also know lots of atheists who were sincerely religious once upon a time, and there was no sudden increase in their native intelligence when they abandoned faith. And yes, I also know a few knee-jerk atheists who aren&amp;#39;t unbelievers because they&amp;#39;ve reasoned their way to that position. We live in a world with a range of intellectual abilities in different people, but &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; can be religious or infidel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is not in intelligence. It's on the foundation of their education. Intelligent people who are indoctrinated into a faith can build marvelously intricate palaces of rationalization atop the shoddy vapor of their beliefs about gods and the supernatural; what scientists and atheists must do is build their logic on top of a more solid basis of empirical evidence and relentless self-examination. The difference isn't their ability to reason, it is what they are reasoning &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons we godless need to be militant in expressing our ideas: there are children out there right now who have the potential for genius, but their talents are being shunted into the futile wasteland of religiosity. Yes, there are a lot of atheists in the topmost ranks of successful scientists, but it&amp;#39;s not because they are intrinsically smarter than someone who believes in gods — it&amp;#39;s because they more easily embrace the mode of thinking that is most productive and successful in scientific fields, and are less burdened with absurd presuppositions. Let&amp;#39;s stop handicapping our kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/religious_people_arent_necessa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XMrBlrp8EGc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238338552095"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1183307942888884363">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1371159d47c461f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Still a Believer: James F.

The rumor has it that "he's really struggling with his faith." Sennett is the author of a book on Alvin Plantinga, and along with Douglas Groothuis edited the book, &lt;em&gt;In Defense of Natural Theology: A Post-humean Assessment&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;amp;field-keywords=james+f+sennett"&gt;You can find his books here&lt;/a&gt;. Below is his unedited response to this rumor. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm really not sure how to respond. John Loftus and I have been friends for many years, ever since we were in seminary together in the 1970s. I respect his work and his particular brand of atheism. I think his book is an important contribution to the current intellectual defense of unbelief and appreciate it for the seriousness with which it takes faith and the intellectual case to be made for it. Also, as one who comes from a ministerial background and has suffered at the hands of the church in many of the same ways John has, I have a great deal of sympathy for the non-cognitive dimensions of his journey to unbelief that lie barely concealed between the lines and behind the pages of his book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have doubts. I think I know too much for it to be otherwise. And I think I'm far too honest with myself about the best that unbelief has to offer. I have not mastered the blissful ignorance or self-deception that so many conservative or evangelical Christians manage to shelter themselves with. I don't mean that to sound perjorative, but the fact of the matter is that I find it very difficult to convince very many "Bible believing" Christians that the case for unbelief has a single shred of intellectual strength, and that really bothers me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, I do not consider myself to be on a road to unbelief, or in danger of "abandoning the faith" anytime soon -- or ever, for that matter. I decided a long time ago that the issue really comes down to which set of bothersome, unanswerable questions you're more at peace with -- those you're left with when you believe, or those you're left with when you don't. (One of my gripes about unbelievers is that they so often give the impression that the choice is between belief and lots of stubborn, unanswerable questions, or unbelief and full intellectual satisfaction.) Always I have been of the opinion that the unanswered questions of belief are much easier to live with than those of unbelief. For example (and this is a huge one for me), if I choose naturalism (which I see to be the only real alternative to theism), then I must accept that somewhere, at some time, something came into existence out of absolutely nothing. (For all the efforts of contemporary atheists to escape what Frank Hoyle saw clearly as the implications of big bang cosmology, this consequence still stands undefeated.) And this is a claim I don't even know how to begin  to get my mind around. The perplexities (and they are many) of the problem of evil pale into nothing by comparison. Which is harder to conceive, that one powerful enough to create a universe might have plans too complex for us to fathom that somehow make some kind of sense out of the state we find the world in, or that everything from quarks to DNA to dwarf stars to the whole of the cosmos came out of absolutely, positively, indefinable emptiness??? Sometimes, when my doubts are raging, this is the only place my faith has to stand. But, even at those times, it is enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do have to say that my faith has evolved in recent years to something that most conservatives or evangelicals might not consider "true Christianity." That's okay, though. I long ago stopped worrying about what anybody else thinks of my faith. I have withdrawn from most forms of church leadership -- I am honestly tired of the hassle, tired of the crap, and just plain tired. Furthermore, I find it harder and harder to sanction the bigotry and hard-heartedness that so often goes under the guise of redemptive behavior. Also, I'm much more inclined to a broadly inclusivistic respect for and even openness to other religious traditions, to the point that I am not ready to express anything like the quasi-exclusivistic "There is no other name" xenophobia that most conservative Christians insist on as a &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of the faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you add all of this together with the fact that several years ago I was divorced and remarried, I do tend to fall well outside most circles that many Christians are comfortable with. But, like I said, I long ago stopped worrying what anybody else thinks of me. It's a very serene way to live. I'm very happy, I'm very much at peace. Like Tillich, I meditate; unlike Tillich, I also pray. I've learned a great deal lately from the Pali Canon and the Tao te Ching. I've also gotten to know Jesus perhaps better than ever. I still know that the intellectual case for faith is good, but not overwhelming. But I'm becoming more and more convinced that the existential case for faith can be -- for those who seek it -- downright irresistible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James F.

xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Patrick Holford claims that recent research proposes a mechanism that explains the alleged appetite-curbing effects of a low glycaemic load diet. In a disturbing pattern, he seems to overlook that the paper in question evaluates the impact of a single meal and the researchers report on glycaemic index rather than load. All this and many other issues are overlooked in the promotion of books, seminars and diet clubs and supplements to support Holford's Low GL Diet.&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=holfordwatch.info&amp;amp;blog=1336499&amp;amp;post=3952&amp;amp;subd=holfordwatch&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>dvnutrix</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238336821985"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1278">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd7fe7f2c41afc8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">No concept of X in Y</title><published>2009-03-29T13:53:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T13:53:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1278" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We last saw a &lt;em&gt;Zippy&lt;/em&gt; with this trope in it ("we have no concept of war or private property") back &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=991"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Tongue in cheek, he and his team nicknamed the planet &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena"&gt;Xena&lt;/a&gt;. When a moon was discovered, of course they named it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_(Xena)"&gt;Gabrielle&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, once the orbit was properly determined, the &lt;a href="http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/"&gt;IAU&lt;/a&gt; gave Mike the right to name them officially, so he went with &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/09/13/xena-no-more/"&gt;Eris and Dysnomia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last year. I was at Comic Con, and sneaked into the SciFi channel’s party (which is a whole story in itself). I got to get some interviews with the celebs there, and who did I see but Renee O’Conner, Gabrielle herself! So I caught her attention, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMVRq7E2U8&amp;amp;fmt=18"&gt;this is the result&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;In defense of pedantry, I think precise language is important. It’s important in science, and it’s important in general communication. It’s important because, as many smart people have pointed out, words mean things. If your word communicates things you did not intend, that’s not the fault of everyone else for misunderstanding you. And if you choose words that have both precise and less-precise common usages, they can communicate a lot more than you might realize.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;

The question &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a7229985/should_some_people_just_not_have_kids_due_to_their_genes"&gt;Should some people just not have kids due to their genes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was recently posted over at a &lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a7229985/should_some_people_just_not_have_kids_due_to_their_genes"&gt;BabyCenter&lt;/a&gt; forum. &lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/profile/multiplepersonality"&gt;Multiple Personality&lt;/a&gt; asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know some people IRL with 7 kids, all happy and well-cared for, but all with some degree of mental retardation.  Their chromosomes just don't quite combine right.  Do you think after the first couple kids and the drs telling them that it was likely due to their genes that they should have quit having kids?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wonder about it when I see people's siggys on here.  All their kids have developmental delays, deady food allergies, or autism.  Should those people take a hint that all their kids have serious problems, so quit bringing more kids that will most likely have serious problems into the world and focus your energy on helping the kids you already have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it cruel to continue to have babies when you know that child will likely suffer and not lead a relatively normal life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty (100+ comments) have accrued in response to what are definitely bluntly put, provocative, questions. This is a loaded topic, to say that because you have "bad" genes, or "certain" genes, you either should minimize the number of children you have, or not have children at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that, as &lt;a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/guest-columnists/"&gt;Sandra Ammodt and Sam Wang&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a March 24th guest column, &lt;a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/guest-column-mugged-by-our-genes/"&gt;Mugged By Our Genes?&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/guest-column-mugged-by-our-genes/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;....you may wonder if your genes are ultimately to blame for your fortunes, good or ill. That’s hardly the case: only one-fourth of the variation in life events is heritable, which means that three-fourths is not. So you have plenty of opportunity to influence your circumstances. Whether that’s better than turning into your parents, we’ll leave to your judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aamodt and Wang write about the heritability of psychological traits including depression in considering the suicide last week of Nicholas Hughes, son of poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, "one of the world’s most famous suicides." They note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"me of the effects that we call “genetic” (or “nature”) are the indirect result of people being drawn to particular environments because of their personality. Or to put it another way, some “environmental” (or “nurture”) effects are actually attributable to genetic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some disorders can be inherited from our parents, our genes don't necessarily "sentence" our children to having "something," and this notion has to be kept in mind in considering the questions raised at the &lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a7229985/should_some_people_just_not_have_kids_due_to_their_genes"&gt;BabyCenter&lt;/a&gt; forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son Charlie is our first child and our only child. Between Jim's ADHD and my own "things" (OCD.....I have managed to blog blog blog every day for almost four years straight come June), we figured any kids of ours would have "something." Charlie's autism diagnosis, and the energies, efforts, and decisions we've had to make have changed, and transformed, our lives. I didn't really know when we'd have another child after Charlie was born and, by the time he was diagnosed shortly after his second birthday---and with Jim and me juggling jobs in two different states far away from both of our families----the idea of another child was pushed to the back burner. We saved all the baby stuff from the clothes to the crib and crib bumpers and the stroller and it was only when Charlie turned five and clearly still had a high level of needs, and I was getting deeper into my own job after having taken time off and working part-time, that Jim and I realized, he'd be our only child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been the right decision for our family, though there are plenty of times when I see families with a child on the spectrum and other kids and note their interactions and wonder, &lt;em&gt;what if&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing that Charlie will be very on "on his own" one day, after Jim and I are gone, I do wonder how things might be different if there were a sibling to look out for him, though I weigh this against the knowledge that a sibling of Charlie's might well also be on the spectrum. It wouldn't have been easy to have another child on the spectrum, though we could have managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence my answer to the &lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a7229985/should_some_people_just_not_have_kids_due_to_their_genes"&gt;BabyCenter&lt;/a&gt; forum. I'd hesitate to issue a blanket decree that people with children who have "something" should not, ought not, have other children. Families differ in the resources---financial, emotional, and more---that they have to draw on in raising a child with more needs than many. Asking whether "some people just not have kids due to their genes" is really almost the same as asking if "some people" should have kids at all; if people should have any kids at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Incredulity that anybody thought an archangel dictated a book to Mohammed produced a strange contradiction. I found myself still clinging to belief in Christianity. I was trying to believe — though rarely arguing — ‘Well, your guy didn’t hear voices: but I know a man who did.’ This last, shortest and sharpest, phase pulled down the whole thing. In the end Mohammed made me an atheist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...the idea that there is any book ‘wherein is no doubt’ is insulting as well demonstrably untrue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;HT Agnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6476080984854160950?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Its impact on children and their families is life-altering, its cause is unclear, and its therapies are minimally effective at best and costly, dangerous, or exploitative at worst. It is easy to understand how studies which may show a benefit for afflicted children will rapidly draw attention and proponents, regardless of its plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such therapy is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. There have been some reports that a minority of children with autism have abnormal blood vessels feeding various areas of their brain, potentially limiting the amount of oxygen available to that area of the brain and possibly causing dysfunction of the affected neurons. Notice the hedge terms I use; the evidence is quite weak at this point. Regardless, if this is true, one might expect better functioning of the oxygen deficient neurons with more oxygen delivered. Anecdotes exist describing such a response, but until recently no well designed studies had evaluated the claim.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238298704554"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/harvard_researchers_subpoenaed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcaa2e7ac7892b45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Wasting your time"/><title type="html">Harvard Researchers Subpoenaed</title><published>2009-03-29T04:00:30Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T04:00:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/_rKdM6eROxA/harvard_researchers_subpoenaed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/harvard_researchers_subpoenaed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is one to watch.  We might all get to learn more about the Harvard-Industrial Complex.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/health/policy/28subpoena.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Federal prosecutors have issued a subpoena seeking information about the work and statements of three prominent Harvard researchers who have been the focus of a Congressional investigation into conflicts of interest in medicine.

&lt;p&gt;The researchers -- Drs. Joseph Biederman, Thomas Spencer and Timothy E. Wilens -- are named in the subpoena, which was sent on Wednesday to Fletch Trammel, a lawyer who represents state attorneys general in lawsuits that claim makers of antipsychotic drugs defrauded state Medicaid programs by improperly marketing their medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three researchers have advocated increased use of antipsychotic medicines in children and have accepted lucrative consulting agreements from the drugs' makers. Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican investigating conflicts of interest in medicine, found that each of the researchers had failed to report much of his consulting income to Harvard. Mr. Grassley has also said that Dr. Biederman and Dr. Wilens might have violated federal and university research rules. The controversy led Dr. Biederman to suspend his work with the drug industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/harvard_researchers_subpoenaed.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/_rKdM6eROxA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238297289577"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6646">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc859437f35f765a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="geology"/><title type="html">Palinspastic: Introducing… “The Geology Word of the Week”</title><published>2009-03-29T02:54:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T02:54:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6646" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4d1086e1efc1536a93f07c24cc1f272b&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve decided that it’s *finally* time to return to blogging for Skepchick on a regular basis. I know, I know… I’ve tried (and failed) to do this before. Many of the faithful Skepchick readers have probably never heard of me because I blog so infrequently. My excuse? Graduate school is tough. Obtaining a PhD in science is difficult and, at times, overwhelming. For me, it has been a particularly challenging experience because I have an advisor curse. Seriously. I’m on advisor #3 at the moment. I divorced my first advisor for various reasons and was lucky to find a wonderful new advisor who let me concoct a new thesis project.  The &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; thesis project. My &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; thesis project, at my &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; graduate school. Just a few months ago, advisor #2 announced that he was leaving Woods Hole /MIT for the University of Wyoming. Yes, Wyoming. I had a choice: stay at Woods Hole/MIT and find a new advisor or buy some cowboy boots (and possibly a horse?) and head west. Wyoming offered me a full scholarship to move, but I declined. I didn’t survive Differential Equations and Linear Algebra with human calcuator MIT undergrads to obtain my degree from Wyoming, a fine educational institution but no MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a third advisor- a woman!- has come to my rescue. This particular woman is a highly-respected  geologist here at Woods Hole . She chaired my general exam and watched me transition from my first advisor to my second. She met with me a couple of months ago and, to my astonishment and delight, offered to become my advisor. We reached a wonderful compromise– I will continue to work on my beloved thesis project but with my new advisor. Advisor #3 will supervise my day-to-day research, which is related to some of her own research, while advisor #2 will continue to provide specific expertise on matters of the project which advisor #3 is not familair with. To compensate for all of this advisor swapping, I have also obtained advisors #4 and #5 who (unofficially) will also guide me with parts of the project. Hopefully, advisors #3, #4, and #5 will not be affected by my advisor curse. But, hey, at least I’m increasing my odds. They can’t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; leave… or can they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very concerned over the past few months that this complex advisor shuffling would fail, and I would be shopping for sparkly spurs for those cowboy boots. Remarkably, everything seems to be working out. In January I spent four weeks in Oman, my field area for my thesis research. I’ll write some about that trip in future Skepchick posts. Yesterday I submitted my 20-page thesis proposal. I’ll defend this proposal in two weeks time and after that will become a full-fledged PhD candidate. From that point onward, there will be no looking back. I will carry out my thesis research and obtain that PhD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, excuses and graduate school woes aside, it’s time for the heart of this post: the geology word of the week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m introducing the geology word of the week for a few reasons:&lt;br&gt;
1. If I call it the word of the week, it will remind (force?) me to post on Skepchick at least once a week.&lt;br&gt;
2. One of the biggest gaps between the scientific community and the public at large is the language barrier. Scientists enjoy making up fancy words for everything. Geologists are particularly bad as they have millions of words for different rocks, minerals, and structures. Reading a geology paper is, even for me at times, much like deciphering a complex code full of “-ites” and “-gys” and “-stones”. I speak geology, at least certain dialects of geology. I’d like to help Skepchick readers learn some basic geo lingo.&lt;br&gt;
3. Sometimes, science words are very, very funny. To the point where you wonder if scientists make up these funny words on purpose. I hope to present some particularly amusing ones.&lt;br&gt;
4. I’d like to learn, too. If you have suggestions for a word of the week, let me know. I’ll start with geology words but perhaps I can expand to science words in general. Do me a favor and don’t post the words– just email them to Skepchick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that long-winded introduction, this week’s “Geology Word of the Week” is: &lt;strong&gt;PALINSPASTIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;definition:&lt;br&gt;
1. Showing the previous location of geological features, correcting for any intervening crustal movements (wikitionary).&lt;br&gt;
2. An adjective describing former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s scatterbrained mannerisms and speach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from the geology literature:&lt;br&gt;
“This paper presents a new palinspastic restoration of the Eastern Alps for Neogene time and an attempt to reconstruct the Neogene palaeogeology, palaeotopography and palaeohydrography in connection with the structural evolution. The Eastern Alps underwent radical horizontal displacement during the Neogene due to large strike-slip systems and formation of structural windows. Our palinspastic reconstruction considers: (a) the rearrangement of tectonic units dismembered during tectonic extrusion, (b) the tectonic denudation driven by displacement of the crystalline blocks, (c) geochronological arguments, and (d) the sedimentary record of the syn-extrusion basins.”&lt;br&gt;
From: Frisch et al. (1998). Palinspastic reconstruction and topographic evolution of the Eastern Alps during late Tertiary tectonic extrusion. &lt;em&gt;Tectonophysics&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 297, Issues 1-4: 1-15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this week’s word. I look forward to returning to my Skepchick posting duties!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238296349783"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2691">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c932f997e1e60c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Texas"/><category term="Texas State Board of Education"/><title type="html">Maybe science in Texas is not so safe after all</title><published>2009-03-29T03:10:30Z</published><updated>2009-03-29T03:10:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/maybe-science-in-texas-is-not-so-safe-after-all/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I blogged about what I thought was a victory for science education in Texas. I reported this because I’d heard that the use of the language “strengths and weaknesses” of evolution, one of the newer creationist buzz terms, was not accepted into the board’s science policy. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/texas_boe_roundup.php"&gt;It seems though that I was a little hasty, as PZ Myers reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the creationists are going to come back with a novel definition of ’scientific’ evidence that treats Intelligent Design as a scientific hypothesis, and they’re going to demand textbooks that include a treatment of all kinds of nonsensical ‘theories’. ID is not scientific. It has no evidence in its favor (pointing out that we lack intermediate fossils showing the evolution of the lesser red-necked Argentinian swamp leech is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; evidence that it was designed). But the Discovery Institute does have another &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/explore_evolution_gets_another.php"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/06/explore_evolutiondisplacing_go.php"&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; waiting in the wings for the next round of textbook-buying decisions in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/outcome-in-texas-mixed-but-not-that-great/"&gt;other obvious problems with those additions&lt;/a&gt;. High school students are expect to study &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sides of scientific evidence? Really? I’ve been in the high schools. Texas students must be truly brilliant if they can master the whole of the scientific literature in a semester-long grade school level introductory course to biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that creationists may have gotten exactly what they wanted after all, just with even more roundabout language.&lt;/p&gt;

I almost forgot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8:30 local time tonight, turn off your lights for an hour. Not all of them, just the ones you aren’t using. Shut down the appliances, too. Don’t leave the TV on, don’t set up the automatic coffeepot for tomorrow (leaving ground beans in a coffeemaker for that long oxidizes them and makes them bitter anyway), whatever. You know your place better than I do, so poke around and find things to unplug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps to turn off outside lights, too. Take this chance to go outside if you can and look at some stars! Saturn is up now at sunset, hanging under Leo’s belly. Orion is up, too, and Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Maybe you’ll see &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;the newly upgraded space station&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good idea. It’s not a big deal, and won’t save the world… but it might make you aware of the stuff you leave on all the time. Now, if I can just get my teenaged daughter to shut off lights &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;… and you kids GET OFF MY LAWN!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238285012459"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/28/still-yet-again-even-more-reviews-of-death/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dfd6fbc2697df4dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Still yet again even more reviews of DEATH</title><published>2009-03-28T23:14:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T23:14:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/28/still-yet-again-even-more-reviews-of-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

A wheeled board is useless outside of a half-pipe or the fucking X-Games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's you worthless douches that have ruined all of the concrete benches on campus with your incessant need to grind on any available surface. Perfectly good rectangular benches now look like an insane shoeshine has blown his polish-wad all over the edges while, for some ineffable reason, taking to them with his jackhammer with a fervor unmatched by any road construction worker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the university spent &lt;i&gt;my fucking money&lt;/i&gt; to put plastic brackets along the edges of every fucking smooth surface on campus to stop you dipshits from ruining them further, effectively making most of them &lt;i&gt;unsittable&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know, I know, that wasn't &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; fault, says the individual Sk8terB0i. It's everyone else; if you had been the only one, there would be no problem. Just remember, you fuck, no single snowflake thinks it's to blame for the avalanche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope that before long, skateboarding &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a crime and they lock you pseudo-punk retards up. Then we will be free your lame and incredibly inefficient mode of transportation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sooner or later I'm just going to stop getting out of your way and, trust me, it'll be worse for you than it will for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*****&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Ginger Girl,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible for you to stop texting for an hour and pay a-fucking-ttention in class? I know that it's not exactly obtrusive most of the time, and at least you're not actually &lt;i&gt;talking&lt;/i&gt; on that cell phone that's been surgically attached to your hand, but seriously: you're not so fucking special that someone needs to be hearing from you at every hour of the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And at least have the common courtesy to sit near the back if you're going to be such an &lt;i&gt;obvious&lt;/i&gt; rude bitch. I mean, last week, the TA was &lt;i&gt;less than two feet away from you&lt;/i&gt; trying to lecture when you cracked open your fucking insecurity machine to tell someone something that I'm sure was &lt;i&gt;so important&lt;/i&gt; that it couldn't wait another twenty minutes. I'm sure daddy is real proud of how you're spending his money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, why even bother coming to class? It's not like you take notes; you're too busy talking about how hot Edward from &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; is with some other vapid bitch who didn't think Anne Rice's vampires were gay enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So fuck you, you ill-mannered cunt. If you had real friends, you wouldn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to constantly remind them of your presence by intentionally showing how completely you disdain the hard work of the people trying desperately to give you an education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And seriously, &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; fucking sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*****&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear iPod Listeners,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though I count myself among your number, I can't say that there's much camaraderie between us. Of course, "We all listen to iPods on the bus" wouldn't do much to bring us together as a community in the first place, but it should, at the very least, not drive us apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What am I talking about, you wonder? Glad you asked. Let me pose a question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you fuckers deaf yourselves, or just completely unaware that other people aren't?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, &lt;i&gt;come on&lt;/i&gt;. It would be one thing if you were wearing old-school over-the top headphones; I can understand some sound leakage there. But you're not. You're using earbuds, which sit &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"&gt;pinnae&lt;/a&gt; and directionally blast the sound &lt;i&gt;straight into your fucking ear canal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So why is it that I can always hear your creatively bankrupt nu-metal, or your shitty, cookie-cutter jam band as if it was coming from &lt;i&gt;my own&lt;/i&gt; headphones? I shouldn't have to listen to that shit &lt;i&gt;at any point&lt;/i&gt;, much less &lt;i&gt;over the sound of my own earbuds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope your eardrums rupture, you noise-polluting pieces of human shit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely, Akusai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-6655531462177249876?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238274813538"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/kareem_dale_on_the_special_olympics_idea_autism">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19ce530710ab7fc2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Kareem Dale on the Special Olympics, IDEA, Autism</title><published>2009-03-28T21:09:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T21:09:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/kareem_dale_on_the_special_olympics_idea_autism" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/US-WhiteHouse-Logo.svg/720px-US-WhiteHouse-Logo.svg.png" height="120" alt="White House logo" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="170"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Exclusive from the March 24th &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/03/24/kareem-dale/2639/"&gt;Disability Scoop&lt;/a&gt;: An &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/03/24/kareem-dale/2639/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; by Michelle Diament with Kareem Dale, the "first ever special assistant to the president for disability policy," in the wake of President Obama's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_olympics_for_who_i"&gt;unfortunate reference to the Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Dale comments on his responsibilities as a member of the office of public liaison at the White House and of the Domestic Policy Council working on disability policy, and about the President and his administration's response to his remark on the Today Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale also reiterates, though quite briefly, that the administration is still behind full funding &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt;, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Regarding the President's singling out autism on its &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;agenda for disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and whether this is just a "factor of current times," Dale comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, we view it as a comprehensive approach. I’m on the ground dealing with the autism community just as I deal with the community dealing with physical disabilities, just as I talk to the blind community everyday or just as I talk to the community of folks who are deaf everyday. There’s legislation that we’re going to be looking at for all different segments of the population and when I deal with the communities everyday I deal with them all together. I talk with each individual community. I work with them. I bring them all in for meetings, different groups at different times and with other groups. Autism groups will come in with some of the mental health groups or vice versa and sometimes groups will come in alone. Or autism groups may come in with the blind community. We view it all as a comprehensive approach for the disability community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good of course to know that there's support and willingness to listen to the autism community (and hoping that all voices of the autism community are being invited and heard). Dale's statement about what the administration is actually doing regarding autism issues is vague and I'd like to know more specifics about what's going on with actual programs and research, and that the educational and daily living needs of persons of all ages on the spectrum will be a priority. Dale makes a hopeful comment in closing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably right there at the top is the overall integration and inclusion of people with disabilities into the administration and what we’re doing because that’s kind of where it all starts from is making sure that folks with disabilities are included into the administration’s efforts and there are a lot of other people who play key roles in that. It’s not just me. It’s far from just me. It’s more of a team. As more of the (federal) agency folks get put into place by the president, I think that effort will blossom and continue to expand, but that’s a big effort. And then I think not much more different from the president’s overall agenda for the whole country. We are a part of the country and need to be included in the country so health care is a critical issue for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "overall integration and inclusion of people with disabilities into the administration" is commendable and necessary. In the wake of the President's gaffe, here's hoping that there can be renewed and greater focus on the needs of individuals with disabilities and greater understanding.  And no more unnecessary remarks about the Special Olympics, from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238272182482"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-3043068989182632986">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d93382fa34889ff5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Blog Carnivals" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The 108th Skeptics Circle</title><published>2009-03-28T19:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T19:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/03/108th-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1315"&gt;The 108th meeting of the Skeptics Circle&lt;/a&gt; has been posted at &lt;a href="http://podblack.com"&gt;Podblack Cat&lt;/a&gt; in YouTube form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please take this opportunity to muse on the TV show I was just watching wherein Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, and Staind played Metallica covers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the fuck?&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-3043068989182632986?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238268610573"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_was_feeling_pretty_good_abou.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2bb46e8a4bb9f4b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">I was feeling pretty good about being at the top of the list, until I looked down</title><published>2009-03-28T18:12:58Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T18:12:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ZKvqcgEsqBU/i_was_feeling_pretty_good_abou.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_was_feeling_pretty_good_abou.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who's going to the &lt;a href="http://americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/annual_conference/"&gt;American Humanist meeting in June&lt;/a&gt;?

(Shut up.  I know it’s well past noon, but I’m working nights, so it’s morning for me :p)  Here I am on the couch again, catching the few minutes of relaxation I get these days before going back in to work.  We do have a nuclear plant to get back online, after all (we are currently in a refueling outage, hence the overtime and the nights).  It’s a pretty cool place to work, actually; a very palpable reminder of what science can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s been a lot of talk over the past few years about expanding our use of nuclear power as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

UPDATE: I decided to include the specs for my stolen laptop, just in case someone in Boston happens across this post while doing some budget-friendly laptop shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple 13.3″ MacBook (white) with two small cracks on either side of the trackpad. Serial # WQ7191UXYA2&lt;br&gt;
***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of continuing to play my life out like the primary orphan in a Dickens novel, I arrived home last night to discover that someone had crowbarred through my apartment door and stolen my laptop, my camera, my favorite watch (that, okay, I never actually wore but STILL), some jewelry, and a few hundred dollars in cash (now I don’t have to bother exchanging those British pounds!). My bedroom was upended, and some local cops got to see the contents of my Nightstand o’ Sin mixed in with jewelry, decks of playing cards, and a chop cup. Weird how the thief managed to find things I’ve been missing for months. On the plus side, though, Captain Infinity and Doctor Calimari resisted the siren call of the out-of-doors in favor of cowering in a closet until I came home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those keeping track, yes, in the past two weeks I’ve been hit by a car and robbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of things that were important to me sucks, and the sudden lack of safety sucks more, and the reminder that there are sucky people who suck, well, that sucks most of all. It’s all around pretty sucky. I already feel as though this incident has changed me - for instance, previously I was not in favor of the death penalty, but now I am convinced that those found guilty of home invasion and burglary should be murdered in the face by bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES, IN THE FACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the police officers and detectives helping me have been really sympathetic and reassuring. Also, I really appreciate all the kind messages I’ve received from those of you following along on Twitter and Facebook. It’s helpful to know that I’m not alone, even when I’m physically alone in my apartment while staying up all night with all the lights on holding a frying pan staring wide-eyed at the door and pondering man’s inhumanity to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of you have asked how you can help. At this point, it’s safe to say that I’ll never see my beloved MacBook again, so I guess I’m going to need to buy another one (and no, it was not insured). A few people have contacted me with the possibility of getting a deal, which I really appreciate. Others have offered me money, which I also appreciate but I’m hesitant to accept, because that’s just the way I am. However, I’m going to swallow my pride. The computer is, after all, pretty much completely used for Skepchick and SGU-related stuff, so if Skepchick and SGU fans want to help, then what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE! SEE BELOW&lt;br&gt;
&lt;del&gt;So, if you’d like to contribute to the new-laptop fund, feel free to paypal some clams to skepchick@skepchick.org. Or, you could send something (non-monetary things like postcards are always nice, too) to me at PO Box 452, Brookline, MA 02446.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;To lesson my guilt over accepting money, each person who sends money in any amount over $1 will receive a homemade Paint darwing made by me. (Macs don’t come with Paint but I’ll figure something out.) This was a suggestion made by Tkingdoll which I have stolen for myself. Oh, but not stolen like my laptop was stolen. More like in the way that one steals hearts or kisses.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thanks again to everyone who has been checking in and helping out, and thanks for just reading, since I tend to deal with trying situations by broadcasting them to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: In just a day, you all donated more than enough for a new laptop. You’re incredible. I’m adding up the numbers but it looks like I’m all set for a laptop + security features, possibly bear-related.

In fact, one often hears that falsificationism is a (if not &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;) defining feature of the scientific method.  Is it?  For those who are open to a different understanding of scientific &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;methods &lt;/span&gt;(plural), I recommend the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Birkhead, T. 2008. &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403006."&gt;In praise of fishing trips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/span&gt;, July 31st.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleland, C.E. 2001.  &lt;a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/%7Ecleland/articles/Cleland.Geology.pdf"&gt;Historical science, experimental science, and the scientific method&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Geology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;: 987-990.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleland, C.E. 2002.  &lt;a href="http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/30/10/951-a"&gt;Historical science, experimental science, and the scientific method: reply to Kilty&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Geology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;: 951-952.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cleland, C.E. 2002.  &lt;a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/%7Ecleland/articles/Cleland.PS.Pdf"&gt;Methodological and epistemic differences between historical science and experimental science&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Philosophy of Science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;: 474-496.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glass, D.J. and N.

And what do we see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Texas being the laughing stock on a world stage, finally replacing the Kansas fiasco from the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a brief intro: this last week, after months of discussion, the Texas State Board of Education voted on the science standards, the baseline scientific knowledge students going through school should know. They vary across grade level, of course, and while there are national standards, states set their own. In general, they use experts in both science and education to advise them, and many states simply adopt or adapt the national standards (I have some experience here– for six years I developed educational activities based on NASA science, and did lot of work with educators and the standards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States should have this right. The problem is, school boards can easily get packed with creationists. And that’s where we get back to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring or even outright denouncing the advice of experts, creationists have been trying in any way they can to attack evolution in the standards. The latest gambit has been what’s called a &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; clause in the standards, which sounds reasonable on the surface: when learning scientific theories, students should understand both where the theory is firm and where it needs work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that creationists are using this as a wedge to lie about evolution. And yes, I mean lie: they hammer away with old, outdated, and easily-disproven ideas in an attempt to make evolution look weak. But let’s be clear: evolutionary ideas are the very basis of modern biology, and are as solid a fact as gravity is. If you think otherwise, you are wrong. This is not just a theory. &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html"&gt;It’s fact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news from Texas is that the &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; clause &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/26/breaking-news-science-wins-in-texas-barely/"&gt;did not pass the vote&lt;/a&gt;. The sad news is that science and reason did not prevail because they are right and the creationists had a change of heart: it didn’t pass because the vote was a tie, 7-7, and it needed a majority to win. So basically, the creationists lost by forfeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the news sinks rapidly. The far-right Republicans on the Board were not finished. They put in language to weaken the Big Bang theory, saying that there are different estimates for the age of the Universe. You can try to be coy and say this is also strictly true, but again that’s a cheat and a lie. The woman who proposed this is obviously a young-Earth creationist, and when she says &amp;quot;different ages&amp;quot;, she means 6000 years. This belief in a young Earth, is, simply, dead wrong. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/05/the-universe-is-1373-12-billion-years-old/"&gt;We know the Universe is 13.7 billion years old&lt;/a&gt;, and the Earth, while younger than that, is still 4.55 or so billion years old itself. This is not some random guess, this is rock-solid (literally) science, confirmed independently from such diverse scientific fields as astronomy, physics, chemistry, anthropology, archaeology… and even the study of how languages change over time shows the humanity is older than 6000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same people on the Board added language to the standards to weaken teaching about global warming. Don McLeroy, who is a creationist and also the Chairman of the BoE, &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/mcleroy-science-and-hooey/"&gt;said that climate change is &amp;quot;hooey&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. They also attack the science on the complexity of the cell, and the initial genesis of life (called &lt;em&gt;abiogeneisis&lt;/em&gt;; life from non-life). These are all standard creationist tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this, I’m surprised they didn’t add standards about how the tooth fairy is real, the Alamo siege was won using prayer, and Hitler and Darwin were secretly married in New Hampshire by a &lt;a href="http://thecrocoduck.ytmnd.com/"&gt;crocoduck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I sound unhappy? Yeah, damn straight I am. These creationists are trying to destroy science in Texas. &lt;strong&gt;And they’re succeeding.&lt;/strong&gt; They are imposing their narrow religious and ideological views on reality, and it’s the schoolchildren in the state who will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re not alone. Think you’re safe from creationist nonsense because you live in Vermont, or Illinois, or Oregon? Think again. Texas is so big and has so many students in it that they have a huge amount of leverage on the textbook industry. This means that the creationists will put their weaselly language into the textbooks, and those will get sold all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I took a look at my daughter’s Earth Science book, and it has a decent chapter about evolution in it, hitting all the right notes: descent with modification, common ancestors, the fossil record, and so on. But how long will that last? I wouldn’t be at all surprised if her next textbook says that scientists disagree about evolution (they don’t disagree at all that it happens, just on some details of how it happens), that some people disagree that the Universe is billions of years old, and that the environment is just hunky-dory, so let’s go drill some more, mmmmkay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems incredible that here we are, in the 21st century, and a group of less than a dozen religious zealots has the kind of power to affect millions of children across the country, but there you have it. One problem with a democracy — and it’s a doozy — is that it’s possible to game the system, and give far too much power to people who are far too unqualified for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s brought us here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the good news: it’s not entirely too late. If you live in some other state, find out who is on your school board [Edited to add: &lt;a href="http://nasbe.org/index.php/web-links/2-state-boards"&gt;go here for that information&lt;/a&gt;]. Find out when they hold meetings, and find out when they adopt their standards. And if it’s soon, or even if it’s not for a while yet, &lt;em&gt;make your voice heard&lt;/em&gt;. And even better, when elections come up for the board, find out where the candidates stand. Ask them point blank: do you think evolution is true? Do you think creationism is true? How would you vote on science standards for our state?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be shy. I did this right after moving to Boulder, and found out what was what. Don’t assume someone else will do it for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you do, you’ll get a Board of Education like the one in Texas. And as for them, well, you’ve seen this before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; rest, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; waiver, and do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; assume this problem will go away. That’s just what they want you to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Something that you could chew on while you're waiting in line for my book to hit the shelves. Something that you can scream from rooftops, or whisper into tender ears of those you love. Something that would give you hope during the trying moments of life. Something that would put a smile on a child. Something that would turn a jury of twelve, talk a man off a ledge, something to parrot as you accept that long-awaited Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I thought different. I hope you enjoy this stuff as much as I do...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;Trained in directing intention, one person in each pair had cancer&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Untrained in directing intention, one person in each pair had cancer&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Untrained in directing intention, neither person in each pair had cancer&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In group 1 and 2, the healthy person directed intention at the sick person.  In group 3, a healthy person directed intention at another healthy person.  Members of group 3 were not randomly selected – they were (obviously) non-randomly allocated to the group with no cancer.  And yet, group 3 was claimed to be the “control group”.  However, all three groups were instructed to direct intention – ie, &lt;strong&gt;even the “control group” directed intention&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is important when you consider the hypothesis being tested, which was:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The principal hypothesis was that the sender&amp;#39;s DHI [distant healing intention] directed toward the distant, isolated receiver would cause the receiver&amp;#39;s autonomic nervous system to become activated.  A secondary analysis explored whether the factors of motivation and training modulated the postulated effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test the principal hypothesis you obviously need a control group which is not sending intention, to compare with the intention group.  Otherwise, how do you know if the intention had any effect?  But there was no group without directed intention, which means &lt;strong&gt;there was no  control group&lt;/strong&gt; to test the actual principal hypothesis the authors of the study specifically said they were testing.  So what were the results?  Did the receiver&amp;#39;s autonomic nervous systems become activated, and did training and motivation make a difference?  Take a look at Figure 6 from the study, and the note under it, and see what you think:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f7c826a970b-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156e81f860970c-pi"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156e81f860970c-800wi" style="margin:3px" title="Figure 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt;   Comparison of sender and receiver effect sizes (per epoch) measured at stimulus offset (with ±2 standard error confidence intervals) for all sessions, motivated sessions (trained group and wait group combined), and trained, wait, and control groups separately. EDA, electrodermal activity.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll note there is no significant difference between the receivers in the different groups.  (The senders differ, but then they knew they were sending.)  The receivers all register an effect, but since there is no control group to compare these results with, these data tell you nothing about the principal hypothesis.  Again I say, you need a control group to test this hypothesis, and they didn’t have one.  There was no significant difference between the trained / untrained groups or between the motivated (ie including sick people) / unmotivated groups.  So the secondary hypothesis failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, end of story. Study failed, yes?  Write it off, study something new next time?  Well, no of course not.  Not with woo.  The study authors weren’t satisfied with that.  Here, Steven Novella noticed something I initially missed.  It was this, from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planned differences in skin conductance among the three groups were not significant, but a post hoc analysis showed that peak deviations were largest and most sustained in the trained group, followed by more moderate effects in the wait group, and still smaller effects in the control group&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Translation: the study didn’t show what we wanted it to show (clearly – see Figure 6), so we data mined it to find something we could say was an effect.  So what did they find with this bit of ad hoc activity?  They produced several other graphs, of which (to keep it simple) I will reproduce just Figure 7:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f7c89c6970b-pi"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f7c89c6970b-800wi" style="margin:3px" title="Figure 7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt;   Normalized comparison of receiver skin conductance levels in the three groups. EDA, electrodermal activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they want you to look at is the difference between the three groups during the “intention” period.  Group 1 (the “trained” group), showed the largest increase during the ten second burst of “intention”.  (See the timescale on the bottom – seconds 0 to 10 is when the intention is being directed.)  OK, but what I want you to notice is the 5 seconds &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the intention (-5 to 0 on the bottom axis).  The normalized EDA is actually higher for one group (group 2 – the “wait” group), when no intention is being directed at all!  So for those not trained, it appears distant healing effects are higher when the sender does nothing.  Even with group 1 (“trained”), the “doing nothing” period has a higher measurement than roughly 50% of the “sending intention” period.  Then it struck me what we are missing – &lt;strong&gt;we are missing readings from all the “doing  nothing” periods – &lt;/strong&gt;since the intention sessions were all 10 seconds long, and the non-intention sessions were from five to 40 seconds long, we are talking about probably 60-75% of the total time.  Was the EDA measurement higher or lower during those periods?  Were there other peaks in EDA during those periods?  They don’t say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m pretty sure they didn’t even look.  Tucked away just before the “results” section of the report, they state this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To avoid multiple testing problems, the preplanned hypothesis examined the normalized deviation only at stimulus offset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve read that section about ten times now, and the only sensible interpretation of that sentence is that they only looked at EDA changes during the intention sending sessions – they didn’t look at them during the non-intention sending periods (unintentional periods?).  This sounds like the sharpshooter fallacy – shooting a load of bullets at the side of a barn and then painting a target where most of the bullets landed.  But they ignored the larger clusters of bullets fired at different times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Why This Is Significant&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author is Dean Radin.  Radin has a history of fitting statistical anomalies to temporal events, while ignoring the same anomalies that occur at other times that he doesn’t want you to know about.  An example would be Radin’s interpretation of the &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;now defunct&lt;/span&gt; (correction - it&amp;#39;s still going) Global Consciousness Project’s (GCP) output from a series of random number generators – data that supposedly showed global consciousness spiked at certain major global events.  If you want to see how credulous Radin can be, and/or how determined he is to find a correlation whether one exists or not (you decide), read this account by Claus Larsen, who attended a &lt;a href="http://www.skepticreport.com/pseudoscience/radin2002.htm"&gt;talk by Dean Radin&lt;/a&gt; in 2002:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Radin gave several examples of how GCP had detected &amp;quot;global consciousness&amp;quot;. One was the day O.J. Simpson was acquitted of double-murder. We were shown a graph where - no doubt about that - the data formed a nice ascending curve in the minutes after the pre-show started, with cameras basically waiting for the verdict to be read. And yes, there was a nice, ascending curve in the minutes after the verdict was read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, about half an hour before the verdict, there was a similar curve ascending for no apparent reason. Radin&amp;#39;s quick explanation before moving on to the next slide? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what happened there.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was not to be the last time we heard that answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does that remind you a little of figure 7 above, and does it make you ask what happened during the “no intention” periods?  It should.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there was 9/11:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another serious problem with the September 11 result was that during the days before the attacks, there were several instances of the [random number generators] picking up data that showed the same fluctuation as on September 11th. When I asked Radin what had happened on those days, the answer was: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I then asked him - and I&amp;#39;ll admit that I was a bit flabbergasted - why on earth he hadn&amp;#39;t gone back to see if similar &amp;quot;global events&amp;quot; had happened there since he got the same fluctuations. He answered that it would be &amp;quot;shoe-horning&amp;quot; - fitting the data to the result. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Checking your hypothesis against seemingly contradictory data is &amp;quot;shoe-horning&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For once, I was speechless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did Radin check to see if there were similar fluctuations in the data in the “down” periods of this recent study?  I don’t know, but we know for a fact from the above that Radin has selected data to fit his hypothesis in the past, and so I’m not going to trust him not to have done it this time.  We know he performed some additional manipulation on the data, as Orac also noticed from the study:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce the potential biasing effects of movement artifacts, all data were visually inspected, and SCL epochs with artifacts were eliminated from further consideration (artifacts were identified by [Dean Radin], who was not blind to each epoch&amp;#39;s underlying condition).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Radin admits he un-blinded the study and eliminated data he didn’t like.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout this post I avoided any personal attacks on Radin’s (or Pillay’s) credibility, and concentrated instead on the actual study.  However, when considering a study that claims a statistical effect like this (and the study authors admit the size of the observed effects were very small), on such frankly dubious grounds, it is relevant to consider where the author has in the past ignored contradictory data when forming conclusions.  Clearly he has in the past, and he may well have done so here.  The most generous conclusion I can draw about this study would be that it would  need to be replicated by  independent experimenters before I would even consider that there might be some basis in what it  is claiming.  (Randi’s $1 million test, anyone?)  A more realistic interpretation is that Radin has been known to select data that fits his hypothesis and ignore that which doesn’t, and so there’s no reason to think that hasn’t happened here.  Radin even admits he un-blinded the study to eliminate some data he didn’t like.  Add the fact that there was no control group, the null hypotheses were not even rejected, and the only interesting thing they found required some (admitted by the authors) post hoc rationalization, and there really isn’t much left worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study ends with the words &lt;em&gt;“This study is dedicated to Elisabeth Targ.”&lt;/em&gt;  That would be the Elizabeth Targ whose study of intercessory prayer was also &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/prayer.html?pg=5&amp;amp;topic=&amp;amp;topic_set="&gt;fraudulently un-blinded&lt;/a&gt; so it could report a success when in reality it had failed.  And this study is dedicated to her?  I couldn’t have put it better myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238256925505"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1276">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2092b3fff89b56c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Errors"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Private meanings</title><published>2009-03-28T16:06:02Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T16:06:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1276" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bizarro takes on a species of semantic error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/BizarroClassy.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my 1980 &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/mistakes.pdf"&gt;booklet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mistakes&lt;/em&gt; (p. 14):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corresponding to the semantic errors above are &lt;small&gt;PRIVATE MEANINGS&lt;/small&gt; … I have one friend who thought for a long time that &lt;em&gt;Indo-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; meant 'southern, lower' (from its occurrence in &lt;em&gt;Indochina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and another who believed that &lt;em&gt;ritzy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; meant 'in poor taste' (as a result of her parents' deprecating tone in using the word).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two examples illustrate two routes to private meanings: a misapprehension about the meanings contributed by parts of a word (&lt;em&gt;Indochina&lt;/em&gt;); and a misapprehension of a word's meaning based on its use in context (&lt;em&gt;ritzy&lt;/em&gt;). Just yesterday I &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/spendthrift-penurious-person/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on my blog about another instance of the first sort: &lt;em&gt;spendthrift&lt;/em&gt; used, in a &lt;em&gt;Cathy&lt;/em&gt; cartoon, for 'penurious person', no doubt because of a connection of the element &lt;em&gt;thrift&lt;/em&gt; to the adjective &lt;em&gt;thrifty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A discussion in ADS-L in February 2008 unearthed several further examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began with a 15 February &lt;a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0802C&amp;amp;L=ADS-L&amp;amp;P=R512&amp;amp;I=-3"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; by Jon Lighter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his prepared public statement on yesterday's campus shootings, NIU President John Peters described the outpouring of public sympathy as "renewing and heart-rendering."  He used the word "heart-rendering" in this connection twice within one minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;heart-rendering&lt;/em&gt; 'heart-warming'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one comes in two pieces: first, a well-known malaprop, &lt;em&gt;heart-rendering&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;heartrending&lt;/em&gt;, with lots of Google hits, complaints going back at least to 1987, and some &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004429.html"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Language Log; and then a positive interpretation of the word, possibly based on the element &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt; in the word, possibly on the influence of &lt;em&gt;heart-warming&lt;/em&gt;, possibly on a perception, in context, of a strong affective component in the word (without an appreciation of its being negative rather than positive) — or, of course, on several of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighter went on to &lt;a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0802C&amp;amp;L=ADS-L&amp;amp;P=R968&amp;amp;I=-3"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt; two more cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a few years back I knew a student who used "tearjerker" in a positive way. E.g., "'Come Up from the Fields, Father,' is Whitman's famous tearjerker about the Civil War." He went on to say how affecting it was.  I suspect this is pretty common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Here student appreciates the affective content of the word, but identifies it as positive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dude, in a letter to the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, insisted that a "stemwinder" was a long, tedious speech, because it made the audience check their watches; then they'd fiddle with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This one gets a connection to the type of watch known as a &lt;em&gt;stemwinder&lt;/em&gt; and to the word's use to characterize speeches, and then the writer devises a story that connects all these things.

&lt;p&gt;Considering that you can't know other someone else's intentions in choosing words, and that context is often inadequate to point clearly to these intentions, it's surprising that more private meanings haven't been reported (except, of course, in child language).

&lt;p&gt;That article was researched and written by investigative journalist Brian Deer, who looked pretty carefully into what Wakefield did. Now mind you, Wakefield wrote that original vaccine-autism article &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-wakefield-vaccine.htm"&gt;after coming up with what he claimed was an alternative to vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, so his own credibility is suspect. And now he is in Austin, Texas, as part of &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/thoughtful-clinical.htm"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt;, where autistic kids undergo &amp;quot;therapy&amp;quot; based on Wakefield’s dubious research. No doubt this is a highly profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did you think Wakefield did when Deer’s article came out? Admit defeat, fold up business, and apologize for starting a movement that has helped hundreds of kids get sick &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/vaccinedenial.html"&gt;and have some of them actually die&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, of course not. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/andrew_wakefield_strikes_back.php"&gt;He wrote a scathing attack on Deer&lt;/a&gt;, most of which is as thin as his original claims about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Deer has responded. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/brian_deer_responds_to_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;Orac has all the pieces to this little puzzle&lt;/a&gt;, and every time another part comes out, things look worse for Wakefield and the pro-measles crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some antiscience is a pain in the neck, and some kills. Think, people.&lt;/p&gt;

I have an even better idea: if you're Catholic, leave the church. Why you are following an ignorant, superstitious kook as a moral authority is mystifying to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In another weird story of the Catholic persecution complex, look what &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/bishop-degrades-jewish-holocaust-suffering-20090328-9eme.html"&gt;a Brazilian archbishop has to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The Jews talk about six million people killed. But how many Catholics were victims of the Holocaust? They were 22 million in all,"&lt;/span&gt; Archbishop Dadeus Grings, from Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, told advertising magazine Press &amp;amp; Advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm. About 3 million Catholics were killed by the Nazi regime in camps…but it wasn&amp;#39;t for being Catholic. It was for being Polish. I don&amp;#39;t know where this mysterious &amp;quot;22 million&amp;quot; number comes from — there were 42 million total civilian casualties in World War II. Is he trying to include every single dead Catholic as a direct victim of the Holocaust? Since by far the largest fraction of the casualties in that war were borne by the Soviet Union, shouldn&amp;#39;t we then be complaining that &lt;i&gt;atheists&lt;/i&gt; were the true martyrs? (Not that I would, I think the reasoning of this archbishop is specious.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/more_catholic_inanity.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/A3XuOGhM9uI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238251744778"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-5285900241535243049">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b3eda87eadfd4d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Catholics - You're Making It Too Easy</title><published>2009-03-28T14:03:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T14:03:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/03/catholics-youre-making-it-too-easy.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Jesus christ, this is getting to be like drag-racing some retard on a tricycle.

Multiple grant deadlines are approaching, and, given that most of my grant support expires towards the middle of next year, I have to go full tilt to keep my lab funded and keep my people employed. Such is how it will be throughout most of 2009 until I obtain some more funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned nearly weeks ago, we have a new six month old puppy named Bailey. He's definitely changed our life in a lot of good ways. One thing that I've noticed is that when he first arrived here from the shelter he was very quiet, submissive, and mellow. Or so it seemed. However, it didn't take long for his true personality to reveal itself, and it turns out that he's actually exhaustingly energetic (well, he is a six-month-old puppy), very intelligent, and more than a little strong-willed. Although he appears to be finally (mostly) house trained (at least, it's been a few days since any "accidents" and he does now--usually--go to the back door when he needs to relieve himself), there were more a few bumps along the way, and occasionally Bailey went a bit full mental jacket, requiring a little &lt;a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisperer/"&gt;Dog Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv/its-me-or-dog/index.html"&gt;Victoria Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; action on him. For a while, we despaired that the methods weren't working because we could see no effect, but then one day, almost like switching on a light, Bailey seemed to start to "get it" and accept us as dominant. That's not to say that he doesn't sometimes still have a little rebellious moment, but they are now usually rapidly overcome. He is, however, scary smart, probably the smartest dog I've had since an incredibly smart terrier my family had when I was a teenager; if only we were more competent at harnessing that intelligence to train him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/bailey_discovers_squirrels.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/bailey_discovers_squirrels.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/1BE61uDtLxs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238249639880"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/texas_boe_roundup.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1ce452decd55bd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Texas BOE roundup</title><published>2009-03-28T15:08:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T15:08:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/1E_ET8HUXWQ/texas_boe_roundup.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/texas_boe_roundup.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How did Texas screw up public education? It's complicated. The rational members of the board managed to exclude the 'strengths and weaknesses' language, which would have invited an immediate assault by the ignorant on a well-established scientific principle, but at the same time the &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/03/28/texas_evolution_case/"&gt;ignorant members of the school board&lt;/a&gt; managed to &lt;a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/03/creationists-no.html"&gt;hammer in several amendments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;analyze, evaluate and critique scientific explanations in all fields of science by using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing, including examining all sides of scientific evidence of those scientific explanations so as to encourage critical thinking by the student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyze and evaluate the evidence regarding formation of simple organic molecules and their organization into long complex molecules having information such as the DNA molecule for self-replicating life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;analyze and evaluate scientific explanations concerning the complexity of the cell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Superficially, those sound fine — of course we want students to analyze the scientific evidence! The problem is that the creationists are going to come back with a novel definition of &amp;#39;scientific&amp;#39; evidence that treats Intelligent Design as a scientific hypothesis, and they&amp;#39;re going to demand textbooks that include a treatment of all kinds of nonsensical &amp;#39;theories&amp;#39;. ID is not scientific. It has no evidence in its favor (pointing out that we lack intermediate fossils showing the evolution of the lesser red-necked Argentinian swamp leech is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; evidence that it was designed). But the Discovery Institute does have another &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/explore_evolution_gets_another.php"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/06/explore_evolutiondisplacing_go.php"&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; waiting in the wings for the next round of textbook-buying decisions in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/outcome-in-texas-mixed-but-not-that-great/"&gt;other obvious problems with those additions&lt;/a&gt;. High school students are expect to study &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; sides of scientific evidence? Really? I've been in the high schools. Texas students must be truly brilliant if they can master the whole of the scientific literature in a semester-long grade school level introductory course to biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas students are going to study abiogenesis? Really? How much organic chemistry and biochemistry do they have under their belts before they begin this class? Perhaps this is just an opportunity to use the students' ignorance of the basics to insert their own ridiculous (and ignorant) claims into the instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and "complexity of the cell" is a common creationist phrase. Yes, the cell is complex. The response they expect from us is awe and incomprehending acceptance of their claim that it is too complex to have evolved, and must have been designed. Sorry, guys, design is better at producing simplicity, while evolution tends to produce complexity. Evolution already explains how you can get complexity. But they won't tell the students that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One further irony: the Houston Chronicle blandly reports that &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6346503.html"&gt;"Scientists from throughout Texas helped shape the new science curriculum standards."&lt;/a&gt; What they don't bother to mention is that these insertions into the standards were generated in &lt;i&gt;opposition&lt;/i&gt; to the input of scientists, in defiance of what the scientific position would propose. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/texas_boe_roundup.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1E_ET8HUXWQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238247301228"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1275">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c08d6a0d43b96aa1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Prescriptivist Poppycock"/><title type="html">Was Strunk imitating Quintilian?</title><published>2009-03-28T13:02:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T13:02:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1275" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bill Walderman &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1273#comment-27574"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Is it possible that the &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; requiring the placement of &amp;quot;however&amp;quot; as the second element of a sentence (or at least not the first element) … originated as an attempt to impose Latin and Greek syntax or word order on English? In Latin, there are a number of particles such as &amp;quot;autem&amp;quot; that can&amp;#39;t be placed at the beginning of a clause and usually appear as the second element. And Ancient Greek is extremely exuberant in particles that must be placed as the second element of a clause and can&amp;#39;t stand as the first element.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting suggestion, which hadn't occurred to me before. On reflection, it seems quite plausible that the odd grammatical myth forbidding initial &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;however&lt;/span&gt; was originally a transfer from the treatment of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; and some other words in Latin, beaten into Will Strunk in his youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But to start with, the grammar of Latin &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; "on the other hand" seems to be a bit of a puzzle in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most familiar second-position elements in Latin are monosyllabic enclitics like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;-que&lt;/span&gt; "and", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;-ne&lt;/span&gt; "question", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;-ve "or",&lt;/span&gt; which are written as part of the word they attach to; and they can't be clause-initial precisely because they must be attached to the end of some full word. But &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; does not seem to be one of these enclitics — it&amp;#39;s not a monosyllable, for one thing; it&amp;#39;s not written solid with the preceding word; and it&amp;#39;s apparently derived from the combination of a connective (which can occur in initial position) with a demonstrative. The Oxford Latin Dictionary analyzes &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"aut + -em&lt;/span&gt; (cf.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;quidem&lt;/span&gt;)"; and the Latin connectives &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;et&lt;/span&gt; "and", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;aut&lt;/span&gt; "or", &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;vel&lt;/span&gt; "or",  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;sed&lt;/span&gt; "but", etc., are happy to be clause-initial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Short note about &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%234634"&gt;autem&lt;/a&gt; that "it is never found at the beginning of a clause, but after one or more words". The OLD says that it is "regularly placed in the second position in its clause, but occasionally postponed, when the first two or three words form a closely-knit (e.g. prepositional) phrase".  And indeed, this appears to uniformly true, from early Latin to late, in all the &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=autem&amp;amp;advanced=1&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0002&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0007&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0008&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0009&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0010&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0011&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0012&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0013&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0014&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0015&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0016&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0017&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0027&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0053&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0061&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0075&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0077&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0079&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0084&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0121&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0123&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0125&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0127&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0129&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0136&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0138&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0139&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0060&amp;amp;doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0072&amp;amp;lang=la&amp;amp;group=bilevel"&gt;11,193&lt;/a&gt; instances where this word occurs in extant Latin prose (not that I've checked them all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in Plautus' &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0035&amp;amp;layout=&amp;amp;loc=273"&gt;Casina&lt;/a&gt; we get&lt;/p&gt;

tu eum orato, ego &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; orabo vilicum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;That's agreed upon. Should you like that, in your name, I should call Chalinus hither out of doors? Do you beg of him, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; I'll beg of the bailiff. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Translation by Henry Thomas Riley]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Plautus' &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3aphi%2c0119%2c010%3a5%3a3%3a9&amp;amp;vers=original&amp;amp;word=autem#word1"&gt;Menaechmi&lt;/a&gt; we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Lumbi sedendo, oculi spectando dolent,&lt;br&gt;
manendo medicum, dum se ex opere recipiat.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;My bones ache with sitting, my eyes with watching, while waiting for the Doctor, till he returned from his business. At last the troublesome fellow has with difficulty got away from his patients. He says that he has set a broken leg for Aesculapius &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; an arm for Apollo. I'm now thinking whether I'm to say that I'm bringing a doctor or a carpenter. But, see, here he comes. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Translation by Henry Thomas Riley]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in one of Cicero's &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0015&amp;amp;query=section%3D%23322&amp;amp;word=autem"&gt;orations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;hunc praesentem eis adfecit honoribus quos habuit amplissimos; vos &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; absens orat atque obsecrat ut sua religio, laudatio, auctoritas aliquid apud vestros animos momenti habuisse videatur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;They distinguished him while he was among them by the greatest honours which they had to bestow; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;and now&lt;/span&gt;, though absent from this place, they pray and entreat you that their blameless character, their panegyric, and their authority may appear to have some weight with you in forming your opinions. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Translation by C.D. Yonge]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from these examples, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; is not very much like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;however&lt;/span&gt; in its meaning. Lewis &amp;amp; Short gloss it &amp;quot;o&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;n the other hand, but, yet, however, nevertheless&lt;/span&gt;; sometimes an emphasized &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;", and note that "it joins to a preceding thought a new one, either entirely antithetical or simply different".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the classical syntax of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt; was apparently so uniform, Plautus and Cicero presumably placed it in second position without any explicit instruction — that&amp;#39;s just how their language worked.  But in the first century A.D., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintilian"&gt;Quintilian&lt;/a&gt;'s textbook on rhetoric, the &lt;a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/home.html"&gt;Institutio Oratoria&lt;/a&gt;, offers &lt;a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html#5"&gt;explicit advice&lt;/a&gt; on this point (I.5.39):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There is, however, some controversy as to the number and nature of the different kinds of solecism. Those who have dealt with the subject most fully make a fourfold division, identical with that which is made in the case of barbarisms: solecisms are brought about by addition, for instance in phrases such as nam enim, de susum, in Alexandriam;  by omission, in phrases such as ambulo viam, Aegypto venio, or ne hoc fecit: and by transposition as in quoque ego, enim hoc voluit, autem non habuit.&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; Under this last head comes the question whether igitur can be placed first in a sentence: for I note that authors of the first rank disagree on this point, some of them frequently placing it in that position, others never. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Translation by H.E. Butler]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;i.e. nam cannot be coupled with enim; de being a preposition cannot govern an adverb ("from above"); in is not required with Alexandriam, which is the name of a town. Quoque, enim and autem cannot come first in a sentence. Ambulo per viam, ab Aegypto venio, ne hoc quidem fecit would be the correct Latin. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Editor's note from Butler's Loeb edition]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Yes, it really is footnote 42…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;enim&lt;/span&gt; "indeed" is a bit different from &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt;, in that Plautus and Terence sometimes use it clause-initially. And &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340283"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;quoque&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;also, even&amp;quot; seems to be be even more different — it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;subjoined to the emphatic word in a clause&amp;quot;, as Lewis &amp;amp; Short put it, or &amp;quot;usu. placed directly after the word to which it belongs&amp;quot;, as the OLD explains, not placed in second position. Thus in Cicero&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3aphi%2c0474%2c030%3a12%3a33&amp;amp;vers=original&amp;amp;word=quo%5Eque1#word1"&gt;Pro C. Rabirio Postvmo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… me scilicet maxime, sed proxime illum &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;quoque&lt;/span&gt; fefellissem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… I should have behaved dishonestly, principally, indeed, to myself, but in the next degree to him &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[Translation C.D. Yonge]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Though in the particular examples cited above, and a few others that I've now looked at, it could be argued that the word or phrase preceding &lt;em&gt;autem&lt;/em&gt; is emphasized as the constrasting element, in a way exactly analogous to the function of &lt;em&gt;quoque&lt;/em&gt;. There would still be a difference in the preference for association with emphatic words at the beginning of a clause. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the grammar of Latin &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem&lt;/span&gt;, and the authority of Quintilian in treating the initial placement of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;autem, enim, quoque&lt;/span&gt; as a solecism, may very well be the what put into Will Strunk's mind the germ of the idea that English &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;however&lt;/span&gt; ought to be similarly restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Walderman's &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1273#comment-27574"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I don't have access to the OED–-perhaps someone could trace the use of "however" through the history of English to see whether it was used as the first element of a clause early in its history and only later began to be displaced from its position of priority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED's list of citations doesn't really support this idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;however&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; "Qualifying a sentence or clause as a whole: For all that, nevertheless, notwithstanding; yet; = &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; at the beginning of the sentence"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoff Pullum has &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001913.html"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; that there might have been a late-19th-century fashion for postponing &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;however&lt;/span&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1273"&gt;his evidence turned out to be flawed&lt;/a&gt;. This idea might still turn out to be statistically valid — and perhaps Latin composition exercises influenced this trend, if this trend existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending a larger-scale investigation, this whole line of reasoning is speculative at best. But it might help explain where Will Strunk got the strange impulse to declare that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001912.html"&gt;Mark Twain used &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt; incorrectly two-thirds of the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238246153548"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/museum_opens_catalogue_to_user.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53575d2d4e396cac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Museum Opens Catalogue to User Participation</title><published>2009-03-28T14:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T14:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/cU2MFf7u1xM/museum_opens_catalogue_to_user.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/museum_opens_catalogue_to_user.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/swedish_heritage_board_puts_go.php"&gt;chronicled here before&lt;/a&gt;, some forward-thinking colleagues of mine in the Swedish heritage business are embracing the social web and launching cutting-edge apps and projects. This is impressive not least because they are all working for state bodies founded in the 17th century. Just the other day Minister for Municipalities and the Financial Market Mats Odell gave the National Heritage Board &lt;a href="http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.220418/regeringen-satsar-pa-e-tjanster"&gt;a big shout-out&lt;/a&gt; for their Flickr project. (This is funny because Odell is a Christian Democrat and my buddies Lars and Johan are not so much.) Well-deserved praise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ulf Bodin has announced the start of &lt;a href="http://adelso.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/mina-samlingar/"&gt;beta testing&lt;/a&gt; of a Web 2.0 interface to the on-line catalogue of the &lt;a href="http://www.historiska.se/"&gt;Museum of National Antiquities&lt;/a&gt; in Stockholm. (This is the place where some of the staff reliably throw angry fits in the comments section if I criticise any of their other outreach efforts. I look upon the museum as my Alma Mater.) Ulf's new application allows users to log onto the catalogue system and &lt;i&gt;enter data&lt;/i&gt; into a set of user-available fields! You can tag catalogue entries in the same manner as on Flickr or YouTube, you can keep lists of entries, you can write notes and make them public, you can suggest relevant reading and you can point out errors. The integrity of the museum-supplied data still stands, but now us users can help accrete more info around each find and site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum that keeps some of Sweden's oldest human-made objects is also the one with the most updated on-line presence!

&lt;p&gt;If you have to ask the question in the first place, then you’ve got your answer. And what does it tell you when Deepak Chopra looks like the rational one in the debate?&lt;/p&gt;

I bought three strands of worry beads in Greece, one each for the administrative assistants who help me in untold ways at work. When I took the beads out of my luggage to show my parents and Charlie last weekend, Charlie----eyes wide---reached for the strands of olive and reddish-brown beads, and was soon swinging them about and running his long fingers over and over their smooth surfaces. A third strand, in a brilliant translucent blue, with a tassel and a few eye beads intermixed with the blue, was left on the carpet---somehow the neutral colors appealed to Charlie, who's previously been drawn mostly to blue, green, and bright colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beads are readily findable at most every souvenir stand in Athens and in the other places in Greece we visited. Charlie liked his beads so much, last night he placed them in the prized position beside the pillow on his bed. The two worry bead strands snaked around each other, close to Charlie's head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worry beads&lt;/em&gt;--- they're just the right size to hold in one's palm. Too big for a bracelet, they can be slung around the wrist. They seem to provide just the right amount of sensory reinforcement: There's a coolness to the beads, and it's very pleasant (as I've been discovering) to roll the beads around in your palm. Some beads are round, some oval with subtle notches. Rolling them around in one's palm is a different motion than squeezing a stress or squishy ball, both of which Charlie's had many of. And they're not too large to be too much to carry, and not too small so that, if misplaced, they elude detection in the crack of the couch cushions or behind a bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only I'd bought a dozen or so strands of beads. I should have realized they'd be a fitting gift for Charlie, in more ways than one. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238220853555"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/wow-those-cars-are-spectacula/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa8c9e9fb3a684b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">wow, those cars are spectacula…</title><published>2009-03-28T06:07:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T06:07:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/wow-those-cars-are-spectacula/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;wow, those cars are spectacularly ugly #f1&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238220274733"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c91ce84828bbfd05</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="psychic"/><category term="UK"/><title type="html">State-funded psychics in the UK?</title><published>2009-03-28T05:44:02Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T05:44:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/state-funded-psychics-in-the-uk/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s another reason why I’m glad I live in the U.S. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7965934.stm"&gt;UK psychics have been given state funding&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right. People’s tax dollars are being wasted on helping psychics get back to work. But at least the decision’s being challenged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taxpayers’ Alliance called it a “ridiculous” waste on “mumbo-jumbo”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly government said it was “checking to determine how this unique venture fits in with the aims of the programme”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny because if I had psychic powers, I doubt very much that I’d need to trouble the government for a bail out.&lt;/p&gt;

Some Contradictions.</title><published>2009-03-28T05:57:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T19:45:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-hear-4.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-day-11.html" rel=""&gt;my brief post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday (just below this post) I described Ben Neilson’s testimony to the effect that the injury shown in newspaper photos was not the mark he saw on Zachary Dennis’ arm when Freshwater used the Tesla coil on both students (in different classes).  Today that testimony was contradicted, as an investigator described a very different account given by Ben Neilson to to the investigators in the course of an interview with Ben in the spring of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will juxtapose Ben Neilson’s testimony from yesterday, Mar 26, and the cross examination of Julia Herlevi, an employee of HR OnCall, which did the investigation for the Board of Education.  Ms. Herlevi was present at the interview of Ben Neilson and took notes during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, sometime over the weekend, I’ll post a description of the rest of the testimony on Thursday and Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Testimony, Mark and Ben Neilson, Thursday, Mar 26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before calling Ben Neilson, a student in one of Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes in 2007-2008, R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, called Mark Neilson, Ben’s father, to testify about Ben’s knowledge, saying that both Mark Neilson and Ben Neilson objected to Ben, a juvenile, testifying in open hearing, and that the Freshwater side was concerned about protecting students’ anonymity in the proceedings.  David Millstone objected on the grounds that (1) Freshwater initially opposed a closed hearing and insisted on an open hearing; (2) Freshwater opposed an &lt;em&gt;in camera&lt;/em&gt; hearing of the testimony of students, though the Board was willing; and (3) to attempt to introduce testimony by affidavit without the opportunity for cross examination, when the witness is available, is inappropriate.  (Note that Zachary Dennis’ anonymity had been breached on the first day of the hearing at the insistence of the Freshwater side, even though a federal court had forbidden disclosure of his identity in federal proceedings. So Hamilton’s objections are merely crocodile tears.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hearing referee ruled that testimony about Ben Neilson’s knowledge had to come from Ben Neilson, since there was no issue of witness unavailability.  This is the same ruling the referee made with reference to other students who testified earlier, and Hamilton clearly expected it since he had Ben Neilson waiting outside the hearing room ready to testify.  Hamilton was merely piously grandstanding for the benefit of the gallery and newspaper reporters present at the hearing, as far as I could tell.  The latter haven’t taken the bait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the referee made his ruling with Mark Neilson seated in the witness chair but not yet sworn, Neilson ranted for a few minutes about the cost of the hearing and how Freshwater is a good Christian man who is being done a great wrong.  Neilson compared Freshwater to &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=51&amp;amp;chapter=3&amp;amp;version=31" rel="external "&gt;Peter and John in Acts 3 and 4&lt;/a&gt;, who were arrested by the Sadducees, spent a night in jail, and underwent questioning after healing a cripple and preaching about Jesus.  Peter and John were released and went back to their preaching.  Neilson ended his rant – and it was a rant in tone of voice and choice of words – by saying “It just has to stop!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mvnu.edu/facstaff/professors/Education/mnielson.asp" rel="external "&gt;Mark Neilson is an Associate Professor&lt;/a&gt; in the department of graduate education at the Mt. Vernon Nazarene University, the source of many teachers in the Mt. Vernon City Schools.  It’s an incestuous little town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The referee calmed Neilson and required Ben Neilson to testify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The referee did allow Mark Neilson to be sworn to testify to one incident where he had direct knowledge.  Neilson testified that one morning at breakfast he was reading a newspaper in which a photo of the injury allegedly on the arm of a student was published.  Ben Neilson, his son, saw the photo and exclaimed “That’s not Zach’s arm!”  Under cross examination Mark Neilson couldn’t remember what newspaper it was nor when it occurred.  In cross examination Neilson said that his son had exclaimed “That’s not Zach’s arm” in the photo, and not that it was “not the mark he had seen on Zach’s arm.”  That is, Ben was claiming it wasn’t (a limb of) Zachary in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Neilson Direct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Ben Neilson was sworn.  In direct examination Hamilton introduced an affidavit that Ben had sworn before Hamilton.  Hamilton first asked if Ben had been interviewed by HR OnCall, the Board’s independent investigators.  He was.  Hamilton asked if the investigators asked him to take an oath.  He said they had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note - I don’t have a copy of the affidavit, and had just one rapid scan of it.  I’ll try to get a copy to confirm exactly what it said.  My mentions of what was in it below are based on that fast scan and what was said about its contents in the testimony.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the affidavit, Ben testified that he and Zach were in different 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes.  Ben testified that he had volunteered to be touched with the Tesla coil, and Freshwater moved it from roughly his wrist to near his elbow on the inside of his arm.  He had diagrammed the mark it left in the affidavit.  The diagram showed a cross shape roughly five inches tall with a slightly slanted cross-piece roughly 3 inches long.  He said the mark was pink-ish/red-ish, and did not hurt.  Ben said it looked like a cross but due to the slant of the cross-piece could be an X.  He said it lasted a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that after his class Zachary and he met in the hall and walked together.  They compared marks.  Ben testified that Zachary said the only time he felt anything was when he was sweating in his hockey pads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: The chronology is not clear here.  If Ben and Zachary met after Ben’s class the same day Zachary was burned, Zachary would not yet know the hockey pads would exacerbate the mark.  If it was later, then they were not burned in different classes the same day.  That was not clarified in the hearing that I heard.  It may be that they were marked on different days.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the affidavit Ben had drawn what he saw on Zachary’s arm.  The drawing showed a short vertical line roughly an inch or two tall with no cross-piece.  It looks nothing like the photo that was published &lt;a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/06/20/freshwater_decision.html?sid=101" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and is an exhibit in the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that he thought Zachary’s mark was on his right arm, since they walked side by side with Zachary on his left, and that the mark on Zachary’s arm was on the inner forearm,  In his testimony Ben pointed to the “bump” on the side where the ulna meets the wrist shown in the photograph in evidence as meaning that the mark was on the outer arm, in contrast to where he testified he saw Zachary’s mark on the inner forearm.  According to other testimony the mark was on Zachary’s right arm, but on the outside of the arm, not the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that he didn’t believe the Tesla coil could cause the marks shown in the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben also testified that Freshwater never pushed creationism or intelligent design in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the allegation in the federal complaint by the parents, that Zachary had to be pulled from a field trip after he was moved to Freshwater’s group after Bill White, middle school principal, had leaked Zachary’s identity to Freshwater, (described &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/08/06/17/freshwater_upd.php4" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Ben testified that it did not happen, that he and Zachary were originally assigned to a group not led by Freshwater, and there had been no shifting of assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that in FCA meetings Freshwater was in the back of the room (regular meetings) or at his desk (leadership meetings), and did not participate.  He testified that students made speaker arrangements and led devotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the healing prayer incident, Ben testified that the students gathered around the ill pastor for what they called a “popcorn prayer,” where people gather around someone and each prays as the spirit moves them.  Ben said that he himself was the first to pray.  He didn’t remember whether Freshwater prayed, and said it was “50/50” if Freshwater ever prayed at FCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that he goes to the same church as Freshwater (&lt;a href="http://www.mvtrinity.com/index.php?id=home" rel="external "&gt;Trinity Assembly of God&lt;/a&gt; in Mt. Vernon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that things he learned in Freshwater’s class helped him in 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science rather than having to be retaught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, under questions Ben testified that he knew the difference between right and wrong, and would say so if Freshwater did something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Neilson Cross Examination, Thursday March 26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination David Millstone asked if Ben had told the investigators the truth in his interview with them.  He responded, “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Ben could not remember when he saw the picture in the newspaper and thought it was in either the Mt. Vernon News or the Columbus Dispatch.  Asked if it was “quite a while ago,” he said yes.  Asked what grade he was in when he saw it, he thought in the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.  (Note that this would put it before Zachary Dennis’ identity was made public, which was not until October 2008.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no re-cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone then recalled Mark Neilson, Ben’s father, for cross examination.  Millstone asked when the incident about the newspaper photo occurred, and Mark Neilson couldn’t remember.  He thought it happened “quite a while after the report.”  (The report is dated June 19, 2008.  The Board of Education voted to terminate Freshwater on June 20, 2008.  The Columbus Dispatch provided &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/06/19/mtvernon.html" rel="external "&gt;a link to the pdf of the report&lt;/a&gt; on June 19.  Again, Zachary Dennis was not publicly identified until early October 2008, though Principal White had leaked his identity to Freshwater in the spring of 2008 even though Superintendent Short had promised to maintain his anonymity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigator Julia Herlevi Cross Examination, Friday Mar 27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I noted above, Julia Herlevi is a co-owner of HR OnCall, which did the investigation.  She is also the wife of Tom Herlevi, who was the principal investigator in this case.  Herlevi has nearly 30 years of experience in human resources, including over 15 years of management in which she was actively involved in a variety of investigations of allegations of employee wrong-doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herlevi’s raw notes on a number of investigative interviews were introduced into evidence by Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, in his direct examination of Herlevi.  David Millstone, introduced into evidence Julia Herlevi’s raw notes from the investigators’ interview of Ben Neilson.  The interview was conducted by Tom Herlevi, the principal investigator, in the presence of Ben’s parents.  Recall that in his testimony in cross examination described above, Ben said he told the truth to the investigators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herlevi testified that her notes said that when asked, Ben said he volunteered to be shocked with the Tesla coil in Freshwater’s class, and that Freshwater made a mark on his arm that lasted a day or two.  Asked the shape of the mark, he said “A cross.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes said that Ben told the investigators that the mark on Zachary’s arm looked about the same as the mark on his arm.  He told the investigators that Zachary told him his arm hurt.  According to the notes, Ben did not tell the investigators that the mark on Zachary’s arm was much smaller than his and was a single line but looked about like his own, which he had described to the investigators (and drew in his affidavit) as a fairly large cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked what goes on in Freshwater’s class, Herlevi’s notes say that Ben told the investigators that Freshwater “talks about Big Bang theory and the possibility of intelligent design …”, about “hydrosphere theory”, and about “a boat in a flood.”  He told the investigators that Freshwater taught the students to say “here” when “something in the book wasn’t scientifically proven” such as “that the earth was formed X number of years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his affidavit Ben denied the investigators’ account in those respects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the investigators he told them that he thought Freshwater “sometimes wanted to talk about his beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in his recent affidavit, Ben denied that Freshwater talked about creationism or intelligent design.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the investigator’s notes, in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting where the ‘healing prayer’ occurred, Ben said that Freshwater initiated the prayer, saying “Why don’t we pray for him.”  In his affidavit Ben claimed that a student made that suggestion.  The former story was confirmed by the investigator’s notes of another interview, in which a school employee named Ruth Frady (I’m not sure of the spelling) told the investigators that Freshwater “facilitated” the prayer by telling the students they could circle the ailing pastor and pray for him.  She told the investigators that Freshwater participated in the procedure and said the closing prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-direct of Julia Herlevi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his re-direct Hamilton attempted to show that the investigator’s notes were her subjective impression, not a veridical account of the interview.  He pointed to the paucity of quotation marks in the notes as an example.  He derided her for taking hand-written notes rather than making an audio recording.  He asked “You could have written anything you wanted to, couldn’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (At one point in direct examination by Hamilton Julia Herlevi had said that both she and her husband took notes in their joint interviews, and their notes corresponded closely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herlevi defended her notes, saying she had nearly 30 years of experience and her notes had never before had their credibility questioned.  She asserted they were a close representation of what interviewees actually said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Hamilton’s questioning Herlevi said that interviewees had not had a chance to review her notes and make corrections if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no recross and Herlevi was excused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summation by me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that there are major discrepancies between the story the notes say Ben told the investigators and what he swore to in his affidavit and testimony.  There are three hypotheses that could account for those discrepancies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  Ben did not tell the truth to the investigators, despite testifying under oath in cross examination that he had told them the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Ben did not tell the truth in his affidavit and testimony yesterday, despite being under oath to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  The investigator’s notes completely misrepresent what Ben told them and they simply fabricated their notes and the account of Ben’s interview in their final report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potentially relevant bit of information in this connection is that after the session in which Ben testified, Mark Neilson took me aside outside the hearing room and attempted – unsuccessfully! – to evangelize me.  He was pretty insistent and basically preached to me for several minutes.   He first inquired somewhat aggressively why I “set up a web site” in opposition to Freshwater, apparently referring to the Panda’s Thumb.  Then he moved to preaching to me.  I left after several minutes, having got in a question (unanswered) about God’s love for the 16,000 Midianite virgins turned over to the Israelite army.  But it was very clear that Mark Neilson is a hard-core Freshwater supporter and believes that Freshwater, a “good Christian man,” has been seriously wronged (recall the comparison with Peter and John in Acts in his rant to the hearing referee).  This is the first time in 16 days of the hearing that someone has attempted to evangelize me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three hypotheses, my vote is for #2.  It’s clear that Ben’s father holds very strong views on this subject (witness his rant and his evangelizing of me), and that Ben’s interview with the investigators is a significant part of the case made for termination.  It corroborated allegations of burning crosses on students’ arms; it corroborated allegations that Freshwater was teaching religion-based creationism; it corroborated allegations that Freshwater was undermining students’ acceptance of the best science; and it corroborated allegations that Freshwater took an active role in FCA religious exercises during meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton attempted to establish the credibility of hypothesis 3.  If the investigators’ version of the interview with Ben could be impeached then Hypotheses 1 and 2 go away, and Hypothesis 3 accounts for the discrepancies.  This is part of Hamilton’s general strategy, to argue that the whole matter is aimed at getting rid of Freshwater and that the Board of Education, their law firm, and the investigators are engaged in a massive conspiracy to sacrifice this good Christian man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe it.  There is too much corroborating testimony by too many different people, some of them Freshwater’s supporters, to be attributed to a conspiracy.  I think Ben did not tell the truth in one or the other instance, and I think it was in his affidavit and testimony yesterday, Hypothesis 2.  I think it occurred under enormous pressure, possibly unwitting but possibly not, from his father and other co-religionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben attends Freshwater’s church.  [Added in edit 3/28: This may not be the case; see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-hear-4.html#comment-181501" rel=""&gt;my comment below&lt;/a&gt;.]  He is encapsulated in a familial, social, and religious context where the account he gave to the investigators is in serious conflict with that context’s mythology about how a good Christian man, John Freshwater, is being unjustly persecuted by a cabal of – well, of someone.  That was the main message of his father’s rant about Peter and John in Acts.  That’s a very tough position for an adolescent, and I think under the pressure of that conflict Ben has changed his story, contradicting the true account he gave the investigators last spring before the pressure was on, in order to make it consistent with the mythology surrounding him in his home and church.  Moreover, knowing something about the malleability of human memory, it would not amaze me if Ben now actually believes that his most recent story is the true one.  That is, &lt;em&gt;he may not be consciously lying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I further believe that when this is over the district is going to have to do some serious administrator training, teacher professional development, and even maybe some housecleaning in the middle school.  Given &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-day-10.html" rel=""&gt;Lori Miller’s testimony&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday about her evangelizing in the school and the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; prevalence of religious displays in the middle school, it sounds more like a parochial school than a public school.  It’s not just Freshwater who is a problem there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In former Director of Teaching and Learning Linda Weston’s testimony on Thursday (not yet described here on PT), she mentioned that the district offered teachers a voluntary professional development session on religion in public schools in the fall of 2003 after Freshwater’s proposal to the Board of Education was rejected.  Freshwater did not choose to attend.  It’s about time &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of  the proselytizing and preaching and praying teachers in that district learn the meaning of the First Amendment Establishment Clause.&lt;/p&gt;

This is good for the environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Click here to read more posts tagged BOXED WATER" href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/boxed-water/"&gt;Boxed Water&lt;/a&gt; Is Better sells water in cartons, ditching the plastic bottles while reducing the overall carbon footprint of packing and distribution by 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20% of the company’s profits are passed along to reforestation (10%) and water relief (10%) while you sip on the sweet hydrogen/oxygen nectar of Minnesota and a few parts per billion of paper pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, like the author of the article linked to above, I still don’t understand why anyone in the U.S. would need to buy packaged water in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while &lt;a title="Click here to read more posts tagged BOXED WATER" href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/boxed-water/"&gt;Boxed Water&lt;/a&gt; is undoubtedly more sustainable than bottled water, I can’t help but think the product’s absurdity does less to open a new market than close an old one. In other words, Boxed Water is a ridiculous solution to an even more ridiculous problem—that we’d rather buy packaged water than drink it for nearly free out of the tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what fluoridation phobics would have us believe, U.S. water is among the cleanest in the world. And bottled water isn’t much cleaner (if any) than what Americans can get out of their tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Steve says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any publication with the lax journalistic standards that would allow such rabid antivaccinationist nonsense to be published under its banner is capable of almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A woo-woo vendor named David Stevens is a "Home clearer" who helps real-estate agents by erasing those dreaded negative vibes from properties that aren't selling... Last Monday, Re/Max City Horizon broker Steve Kinney, in his experienced wisdom, summoned guru Stevens to dissipate the negative energy from a new home in the Berkeley neighborhood, vibes that came from the "resentment seeping in from the older property next door." Makes perfect sense, don'tcha think...?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens is the owner of "Yoga of the Mind." He mystically waved his hands, clearing the way for the house to sell. The home had been completed in November, and the developer hadn't had a single offer on it, a sure sign of clogged-up evil vibes. Broker Kinney had purchased these magical gestures several times previously, paying the hand-waver $100 to $200 to have a home "cleared."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238213430226"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7210476564946320126">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f4cc6073eb15b06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Was Jesus a Witch?</title><published>2009-03-28T00:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-28T01:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/vz0is1LSxZM/was-jesus-witch.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/7210476564946320126/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=7210476564946320126" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/was-jesus-witch.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/Sc111HYkqKI/AAAAAAAAAH0/FzbSIez8SUY/s1600-h/jesus-bowl_h2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT:left;MARGIN:0px 10px 10px 0px;WIDTH:320px;HEIGHT:212px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/Sc111HYkqKI/AAAAAAAAAH0/FzbSIez8SUY/s320/jesus-bowl_h2.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earliest reference describes Christ as 'magician'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Bowl dated between late 2nd century B.C. and the early 1st century A.D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bowl, dating to between the late 2nd century B.C. and the early 1st century A.D., is engraved with what may be the world's first known reference to Christ. The engraving reads, "DIA CHRSTOU O GOISTAIS," which has been interpreted to mean either, "by Christ the magician" or, "the magician by Christ."&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A team of scientists led by renowned French marine archaeologist Franck Goddio recently announced that they have found a bowl, dating to between the late 2nd century B.C. and the early 1st century A.D., that is engraved with what they believe could be the world's first known reference to Christ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the word "Christ" refers to the Biblical Jesus Christ, as is speculated, then the discovery may provide evidence that Christianity and paganism at times intertwined in the ancient world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full engraving on the bowl reads, "DIA CHRSTOU O GOISTAIS," which has been interpreted by the excavation team to mean either, "by Christ the magician" or, "the magician by Christ."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It could very well be a reference to Jesus Christ, in that he was once the primary exponent of white magic," Goddio, co-founder of the Oxford Center of Maritime Archaeology, said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He and his colleagues found the object during an excavation of the underwater ruins of Alexandria's ancient great harbor. The Egyptian site also includes the now submerged island of Antirhodos, where Cleopatra's palace may have been located.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Goddio and Egyptologist David Fabre, a member of the European Institute of Submarine Archaeology, think a "magus" could have practiced fortune telling rituals using the bowl. The Book of Matthew refers to "wisemen," or Magi, believed to have been prevalent in the ancient world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Fabre, the bowl is also very similar to one depicted in two early Egyptian earthenware statuettes that are thought to show a soothsaying ritual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It has been known in Mesopotamia probably since the 3rd millennium B.C.," Fabre said. "The soothsayer interprets the forms taken by the oil poured into a cup of water in an interpretation guided by manuals."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added that the individual, or "medium," then goes into a hallucinatory trance when studying the oil in the cup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They therefore see the divinities, or supernatural beings appear that they call to answer their questions with regard to the future," he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The magus might then have used the engraving on the bowl to legitimize his supernatural powers by invoking the name of Christ, the scientists theorize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goddio said, "It is very probable that in Alexandria they were aware of the existence of Jesus" and of his associated legendary miracles, such as transforming water into wine, multiplying loaves of bread, conducting miraculous health cures, and the story of the resurrection itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While not discounting the Jesus Christ interpretation, other researchers have offered different possible interpretations for the engraving, which was made on the thin-walled ceramic bowl after it was fired, since slip was removed during the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bert Smith, a professor of classical archaeology and art at Oxford University, suggests the engraving might be a dedication, or present, made by a certain "Chrestos" belonging to a possible religious association called Ogoistais.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klaus Hallof, director of the Institute of Greek inscriptions at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy, added that if Smith's interpretation proves valid, the word "Ogoistais" could then be connected to known religious groups that worshipped early Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses, such as Hermes, Athena and Isis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hallof additionally pointed out that historians working at around, or just after, the time of the bowl, such as Strabon and Pausanias, refer to the god "Osogo" or "Ogoa," so a variation of this might be what's on the bowl. It is even possible that the bowl refers to both Jesus Christ and Osogo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fabre concluded, "It should be remembered that in Alexandria, paganism, Judaism and Christianity never evolved in isolation. All of these forms of religion (evolved) magical practices that seduced both the humble members of the population and the most well-off classes."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It was in Alexandria where new religious constructions were made to propose solutions to the problem of man, of God's world," he added. "Cults of Isis, mysteries of Mithra, and early Christianity bear witness to this."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bowl is currently on public display in the exhibit "Egypt's Sunken Treasures" at the Matadero Cultural Center in Madrid, Spain, until November 15.&lt;br&gt;© 2009 Discovery Channel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7210476564946320126?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The US is &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27999557/"&gt;officially in a recession&lt;/a&gt;. And the rest of the world seems intent on following suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its heart, much of the problem appears to be related to the penchant of Americans for borrowing money so as to be able to buy things. In particular, getting mortgages to buy homes (the American dream). It became possible to get hundreds of thousands of dollars from a bank with no credit check, no proof of income or employment, and no money down. People ended up with mortgages they could barely afford, with the hope of refinancing or selling at a much higher price a few years down the road. The banks figured that in the worst case, they’d just repossess defaulted homes and sell them for more than the value of the mortgages. All this worked fine so long as property values continued to go up, and the banks continued to lend. But eventually it all had to come toppling down. And topple it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of blame to go around. Irresponsible consumers borrowed way beyond their means, and ended up in houses (or owning cars and huge flat-screen TVs) they couldn’t afford. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/end-wall-st-bull-collapsed-slide.jpg" title="Wall street bull (Photoillustration by Ji Lee)"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/end-wall-st-bull-collapsed-slide.jpg" alt="Wall street bull (Photoillustration by Ji Lee)" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And irresponsible brokers and banks pushed mortgage products they knew were high risk, just to pocket quick commissions, knowing they would be able to sell the lousy mortgage contracts to larger financial institutions. And irresponsible financial institutions bought up mortgages from banks, figuring they could repackage them and sell them to investors around the world for a quick buck. And irresponsible traders created complicated financial products based on these toxic mortgages, somehow claiming to erase the underlying risk. And irresponsible ratings agencies (Moody’s, &lt;del&gt;Morningstar&lt;/del&gt;, S&amp;amp;P, Fitch) evaluated these complicated products, and officially declared them high-grade, when in fact they were essentially worthless. And an irresponsible government systematically deregulated and weakened oversight, allowing Wall Street to drive itself right off a cliff, taking Main Street with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people made a lot of money along the way. It’s hard to know if all of this happened because of rampant greed or astounding stupidity. Probably a healthy dose of both. Michael Lewis, of Liar’s Poker fame, has written a &lt;a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom"&gt;nice piece that sums up some of these recent financial events&lt;/a&gt;. I also highly recommend listening to an &lt;a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1242"&gt;hour-long program from This American Life&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with the news bureau of NPR, exploring some of the underpinnings of the current crisis (produced last May). The program will “explain it all to you”; and exemplifies the best of public radio. If you are too impatient to listen for an hour, you can also &lt;a href="http://www.thislife.org/extras/radio/355_transcript.pdf"&gt;skim the transcript&lt;/a&gt;. We learn how a bartender with no training becomes a successful mortgage broker overnight. It’s hard to know if this is tragedy or farce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a temptation within the ivory tower of academia to assume that this will have only a slight impact. After all, few of us are fortunate enough to have millions of dollars to lose in the market. And academics have a history of being quite conservative financially (with modest debt and modest spending habits), presumably forged in the poverty of graduate school. However, we all have retirement plans, and even though these are usually conservatively managed (e.g., TIAA-CREF funds, instead of invested in highly leveraged hedge funds), they have lost tremendous value over the past months (since there has been essentially no safe place to park one’s money). Academics are impacted in more direct ways as well. After years of often spectacular gains, the endowments of many major research universities have suffered tremendous losses (such as in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/business/04harvard.html?fta=y"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0904/features/balance_sheet.shtml"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;). Since these endowments can be responsible for a fair fraction of the operating budgets, this means that many universities have suddenly lost income. They are often restricted from dipping into their principal, so their only recourse is to reduce spending. State universities are also in terrible shape, since many state budgets have collapsed, and major funding cuts are inevitable (such as in the case of the &lt;a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/20776"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/us/17university.html?em=&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;Arizona State&lt;/a&gt;). Thus Universities are cutting costs across the board, including freezes on hiring and infrastructure development. The US federal government is arguably in the worst shape of all. We are already running large deficits, and now Congress is busy bailing out the financial industry, including Citigroup (one of the world’s largest banks) and AIG (one of the world’s largest insurance firms), and General Motors (the world’s largest auto maker until last year, when it was passed by Toyota). Although the entire scientific enterprise in the US represents only a tiny fraction (~1%) of the current bailout, taxpayers (and their Congress) are probably not feeling particularly generous at the moment. This may have a severe long-term negative impact on the National Labs, as well as research funding across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the profound nature of the current economic crisis has yet to make itself known. After all, it took a few years for the great depression to really kick in. It is sobering to think that, decades from now, this age may not be remembered for the tremendous hope and inspiration accompanying the election of the first African-American president.  Instead, the defining event of our time could well be economic malaise. And this is something everyone, from Wall Street tycoons to scientists to Joe the plumber to farmers in rural China, will suffer for.&lt;/p&gt;

He is an autism rights activist, as well as one of the founders of Autism Network International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elesia&lt;/strong&gt;: What issues are of utmost importance to the Autistic community at this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim&lt;/strong&gt;: I can think of a bunch of them, but I would say they all basically come down to ignorance about what autism is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more effort, funding, and research being directed at preventing the existence of future autistic people than at supporting and maximizing opportunity for autistic people who already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the "services" that do exist for autistic people are not as helpful as they could be, and often are even counterproductive, because they don't accommodate the way autistic brains work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misconception that any given autistic person has an across-the-board "functioning level" means that people considered "low functioning" are denied opportunities for access and self-determination because it's presumed that they're unable to benefit from those opportunities; while people considered "high functioning" are denied supports that would enable them to pursue opportunities, because it's presumed that they're able to function without needing those supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elesia&lt;/strong&gt;: How can others become involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim&lt;/strong&gt;: You mean as allies? Become educated about autism--NOT by reading materials by non-autistic people about how terrible autism is, but by getting to know autistic people. And not just by reading books written by anyone at all, autistic or non-autistic. Meet us and spend time with us and relate to us as equals, not as beneficiaries of special help. Online forums run by autistic people, where most of the participants are autistic, are good places to "meet" autistic people in autistic space where we're allowed to be ourselves, instead of being expected to appear neurotypical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live autistic gatherings, such as &lt;a href="http://www.autreat.com/aut09.html"&gt;Autreat&lt;/a&gt;, are even better if someone really wants to become involved. I remember I once told someone that I hoped he would come to Autreat, because I wanted him to be able to see me in an environment where I'm not handicapped. In the environment where he usually saw me, I was very handicapped. At Autreat, I'm just as autistic as I am everywhere else, but I'm not handicapped. If you get to see autistic people functioning in an autistic-friendly environment, you see a whole different picture than the typical tragic images of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak up whenever and wherever you see anti-autism propaganda, puzzle logos, etc. Maybe carry around copies of leaflets like the one produced by the Autistic Advocacy Group, to hand out when the occasion arises. Write letters to newspapers, television and radio stations, and Internet news outlets critiquing their autism coverage. If you see that a local business is running an anti-autism campaign, take them to task for it, and urge them to do something to promote autism acceptance instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write to your city school board, state and local legislators, and other officials demanding full access and adequate supports for autistic people to participate in education and community life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Schwarz has written some good stuff about allies. I think you can find at least one of his articles in the library at the &lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/"&gt;Autism Information Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Check Phil's article out by clicking &lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/allies.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elesia&lt;/strong&gt;: What are some a) resources and b) etiquette tips that someone new to the Autistic community may find helpful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim&lt;/strong&gt;: a) Of course I'm going to recommend &lt;a href="http://www.autreat.com/"&gt;Autism Network International&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also look at &lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org"&gt;autistics.org: The REAL Voice of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.autisticadvocacy.org"&gt;Autistic Self Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;, a whole lot of different blogs that you can access through &lt;a href="http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"&gt;The Autism Hub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.taaproject.com/"&gt;The Autism Acceptance Project&lt;/a&gt;.... and a huge number of other resources that you can find if you start exploring those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Be aware of sensory issues, and respect whatever unique sensory needs an autistic individual has. These vary a lot among people, so there are no etiquette rules that work for everyone--other than the #1 rule, which is NEVER ASSUME, ALWAYS ASK. The same thing goes for communication, especially nonverbal communication. Don't try to interpret facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice, because if you don't know this person very well, your interpretations are pretty much guaranteed to be wrong. Don't expect autistic people to be able to pick up on things you don't explicitly spell out for us. We have a whole set of guidelines for Autreat. Feel free to ask if you want to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etiquette snippets taken from the Autreat orientation guide, which are good to keep in mind around autistic people in any situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assistive Technology Many people use assistive technology (AT), such as wheelchairs and communication boards, in order to function. Please do not touch or climb on other people's AT devices without their permission. This applies to service animals too! Do not pet, call, talk to, make noises at, or attempt to feed or play with a service animal, unless the handler gives you permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash Photography Flashes of light can hurt people. Before using a camera with a flash, you should get the permission of everyone in the area who will be affected by the flash, even if they will not be in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scents Many people are sensitive to scents. Please do not use scented products at Autreat. If you smoke in designated smoking areas, please be considerate about tobacco odors. If you use products that make it hard for other people to breathe, you may be asked to leave events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound Many people at Autreat have auditory sensitivities and can be hurt by noises that are loud, unexpected, or at a frequency that is painful to the hearer. Please try to avoid making unnecessary loud noise. You don¿t need to go around on tiptoe and whisper all the time. Just try not to shout, bang, stomp, slam, or play music or television at high volume. Activities that are meant to be loud, such as African drumming, will be held in places that can be easily avoided by people who need to avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mulmatsherm/62839864/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/28/62839864_a283bc3105.jpg?v=0" alt="Syracuse Park" style="float:right;margin:10px" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching Please do not touch other people without their permission! This includes "routine" (in NT society) touching such as tapping people on the shoulder to get their attention. Many people at Autreat find it startling or unpleasant to be touched. If you already know a particular person and you know that person is comfortable with certain kinds of touch, that is fine. But do not touch people unless you know it is okay with them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

John Snyder, M.D., is Chief of the Section of General Pediatrics and Medical Director of Pediatric Ambulatory Care at Saint Vincent's Hospital in New York City. He is also Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at New York Medical College. Since 1994 Dr. Snyder has been active in pediatric resident and medical student education with a particular interest in evidence based pediatrics. His main area of interest is medical myth and the ways in which parents utilize information in making medical decisions for their children.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=430"&gt;In his first post,&lt;/a&gt; Snyder comes out swinging, writing about the loss of life due to parents refusing or delaying vaccines. His particular example is Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Parental vaccine refusal endangers lives.&lt;/strong&gt; Here we have a situation in which an unavoidable shortage of a vital vaccine, has combined with an irrational parental mistrust of expert scientific opinion to create a critical mass of vulnerable children. The result, so far, is four dead children. But in the absence of any shortage, vaccine myth and the poor parental decision making it breeds has already had a profound impact, with the potential for more to come. In the never-ending wake of Wakefield, measles outbreaks have occurred in pockets of under-immunized children in areas of New York, San Diego, and Milwaukee.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;HiB was one of our ‘bread and butter’ diseases in the PICU where I began my career a long time ago. It left a devastation of brain damaged children in its wake. We were all so very happy when a vaccine was developed. I can’t imagine ever voluntarily going back to those awful days again!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was working in large hospitals before the vaccine. Knowing that of every 10 babies you admit with HiB, 1 will leave through the morgue and of the 9 that go out the door with their parents, 3 will be starting first grade in the classes for the handicapped (blind, deaf, retarded or any combination of those) really sucks.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Take that to parents who refuse or delay vaccination.</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238199014778"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/richard_dawkins_awesome_comput.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/722e610e3a80ccd3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Richard Dawkins' awesome computer skills baffle Information Theorists of intelligent design</title><published>2009-03-27T22:35:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T22:35:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/M4ceX4QTlXQ/richard_dawkins_awesome_comput.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/richard_dawkins_awesome_comput.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's terribly unfair. Not only are the paladins of evolution handsomer, wittier, more charming, and with a deeper grasp of the truth than the orc-like hordes of creationism, but even our ancillary skills are wielded with more effortless panache than our opponents' primary talents. Here's a beautiful example: Richard Dawkins, a &lt;i&gt;mere&lt;/i&gt; biologist, wrote a clear, simple program in BASIC about thirty years ago that has had the Isaac Newton of Information Theory scratching his head in puzzlement. How did a program running a simple selection algorithm turn a random text string into the specific string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL" so quickly? He must have cheated! There must be some trick in the code! The poor bewildered 'experts' of Design Theory struggled to comprehend, and floundered trying to create a program of equal complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ian Musgrave shows, &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/dembski-weasels.html"&gt;the program is trivial&lt;/a&gt;, and even us biologists can whip one out in minutes. Once again, the ID camp shows themselves to be less a research group than a gaggle of stumblebum clowns, with the capacity to embarrass themselves with their own incompetence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/richard_dawkins_awesome_comput.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/M4ceX4QTlXQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238198653397"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/medbloggers_at_blogworldnew_me.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b2354fba222994c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Medbloggers at BlogWorld/New Media Expo '09</title><published>2009-03-27T23:55:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T23:55:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/no4DLSCpwK8/medbloggers_at_blogworldnew_me.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/medbloggers_at_blogworldnew_me.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.emergiblog.com/2009/03/blogworldnew-media-expo-09-meets-the-medbloggers-were-on.html" title=""&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt; is excited:&lt;/p&gt;

This afternoon, the Texas State Board of Education adopted new science standards for the public schools in Texas. The new guidelines include language that leaves the door open for creationists to wedge religious myths into the science curriculum. The vote on the overall standard was 13-2 to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate was heated at times, and confusing at other times, but there was a lot at stake for students all over the U.S. And ultimately, they are the ones who will suffer the sins of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve personally followed and blogged about this story for two years now, and was disappointed that, despite the hard work and spot on recommendations by the teachers, review committees, and outside parties, like the &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/"&gt;Texas Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, board members let politics and, worse, religious beliefs guide their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen just how deeply today’s vote will impact students, but you can bet we’ll be talking about this unfavorable outcome for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the press release from the Texas Freedom Network after the fold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Freedom Network has released the following statement on the final adoption of science curriculum standards by the Texas State Board of Education today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 27, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TFN President Kathy Miller: Texas State Board of Education Adopts Flawed Science Standards&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “weaknesses” no longer appears in the science standards.  But the document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a series of contradictory and convoluted amendments, the board crafted a road map that creationists will use to pressure publishers into putting phony arguments attacking established science into textbooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate that the politicians on the board seek compromise, but don’t agree that compromises can be made on established mainstream science or on honest education policy.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s truly unfortunate is that we now have to revisit this entire debate in two years when new science textbooks are adopted. Perhaps the Texas legislature can do something to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238197458599"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1187">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed37657f3fbf9f5d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">United Utilities Dowse For Water</title><published>2009-03-27T20:13:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T20:13:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/united-utilities-dowse-for-water/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]

"I was forced to quit my job to care for autistic son," Phlebotomist Katrina Clothier is quoted as saying in Tuesday's &lt;a href="http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/4227008.I_was_forced_to_quit_my_job_to_care_for_autistic_son/"&gt;Gazette-News&lt;/a&gt;. Clothier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... left her job at Harwich Hospital after health bosses refused her a term-time contract, which would mean she would not have to work during school holidays, enabling her to look after her disabled son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 43-year-old said the fact that demand at the clinic is “spiralling out of control” because of a lack of staff makes the decision all the more baffling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a familiar topic to me, how to manage being the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/working-mother/"&gt;working mother&lt;/a&gt; of a disabled child. I'm not sure it's appropriate to call it a balancing act; it's often simply a matter of hurtling through the tasks and responsibilities of one job and then hurrying home to focus on what's not so much a "second job" to me as just what I do----take care, and be with, Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/working-mothers-of-autistic-children/"&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt; that the circumstances of my job---teaching Latin and ancient Greek and administering the Honors Program at a small college in Jersey City---make it possible to have flexible work hours and to do a lot of work at home. Many of my colleagues are supportive, understanding and compassionate about the realities of parenting Charlie.  And while there are numerous duties to carry out in the summer besides teaching, I don't have to be in my office for regular hours and can be at home when Charlie is out of school in the summer (and he'll be out of school more this summer---just learned that Extended School Year will only be 4 days a week and for a shorter period of time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college where I teach has a very different atmosphere than a for-profit company. It's a small college (in terms of numbers and in terms of the physical space it occupies---barely two blocks). It has an atmosphere best described as "homey." Certainly almost everyone knows about Charlie and why it's more than likely for people to see me running down Glenwood Avenue at 1.50pm to my car, to get home to meet the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we change the workplace to make it possible for parents of children with disabilities, as well as for individuals with disabiliities, to work and also provide for the needs of the families?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238195893445"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8277610970464750304">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f69bf3dbcb28139</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Old Tools</title><published>2009-03-27T23:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T23:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/old-tools_27.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8277610970464750304/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8277610970464750304" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> There&amp;#39;s a prize for this one!!</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238193169114"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/shuttle-lands-saturday/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/185d7bef95bd987c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Shuttle lands Saturday</title><published>2009-03-27T22:14:48Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T22:14:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/shuttle-lands-saturday/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Space Shuttle Discovery is due to touch down in Florida at 13:43 Eastern time Saturday! As usual, I’ll try to live Tweet it (&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BANews"&gt;on my new BA News account&lt;/a&gt;). The mission was pretty successful, with the installation of a new truss and solar panels that has given the Space Station full power capacity, as well as bringing up a new crew member and taking one away. The one big glitch was &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2009-03-21-shuttle_N.htm"&gt;a pin installed upside-down&lt;/a&gt; in an equipment platform, which NASA hopes to get fixed soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you can watch the landing &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html"&gt;on NASA TV&lt;/a&gt; (and if you have it, the cable station HDNet commonly shows them live in HD too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "Retropolis By Night"&lt;/b&gt;: Not one of the best things ever by
   the Flower Kings, but Roine Stolt's mediocre is other peoples' brilliant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Porcupine Tree, "Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"&lt;/b&gt;: very typical longish PT. Very good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moxy Fruvous, "The King of Spain"&lt;/b&gt;: incredibly silliness. Moxy is a Toronto-based group that does mostly comic songs, frequently a capella. It's extremely funny and very fun - particularly if you see it live. Alas, Moxy went on what seems to be
permanent hiatus a few years ago, after releasing an amazingly lackluster final album.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis, "Mad Man Moon"&lt;/b&gt;: Going back and listening to old Genesis is always amazing. Even a relatively mediocre old Genesis album is enough to remind me of just why 
Genesis is one of the major influences of pretty much &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; modern prog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pallas, "The Last Angel"&lt;/b&gt;: Pallas is a neo-progressive group that got started
  around the same time as Marillion. They're OK, and they deserve more attention than
  they got, but they've got nothing on Marillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Naftule's Dream, "Black Wedding"&lt;/b&gt;: progressive Klezmer, featuring an intro by
   an absolutely astonishingly great trombone player. Very cool stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes, "Going for the One"&lt;/b&gt;: the leadoff track from one of my favorite Yes albums. Why don't more prog bands use pedal steel? It's got such a great sound!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wishing Tree, "Fly"&lt;/b&gt;: I wrote a longish opinion of the Wishing Tree last week. More listens haven't changed my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sonic Youth, "Candle"&lt;/b&gt;: This is classic Sonic Youth. If you like their sound and
style, you'll love it. If you don't, you won't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy the Man, "Il Quinto Mare"&lt;/b&gt;: Sometimes, a great band should just stay dead. Happy the Man was a brilliant act when they were originally together. Last year, they got
back together and recorded a new album. I wish they hadn't. It's terribly dull. There's 
nothing technically wrong with it - it's got the same kinds of complex time/chord 
structures as old Happy the Man, but somehow it's all just flat. There's no emotion,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, &lt;b&gt;which can even increase the problem&lt;/b&gt;

SO FINE, you bastards. I’ll pick another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave it to the comment that got the most nominations, which &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6212&amp;amp;cpage=2#comment-55946"&gt;came from No Astronomer&lt;/a&gt; in a thread chock-full of hilarious comments: “Why wait until conception? I’ve been teaching my sperm to read for years now. They love the articles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is in fact hilarious, but I have to award the prize to another oft-nominated comment for being both hilarious and educational and buried in a long fight with a seemingly unsinkable creationist. Congratulations to Blake Stacey for the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, one bit of wrongness jams up against another until the individual pieces of wrong are almost indistinguishable, leaving only an impressionistic orgy of fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;History shows that nature based paganism generally leads to a lack of concern with the “least of these” and a survival of the fittest mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Your conflation of all non-Christian beliefs into “nature based paganism” betrays a stupefying ignorance of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Hippocrates was not a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some here have been wallowing around in it and seem to think that they’ve explained co-operation while others seem to think that they’ve explained war on evolutionary terms. That’s because despite Darwin’s best efforts at reforming hypothetical goo “evolution” is generally still not a scientific theory which is testable. Instead, it is a meaningless word that can comport with all change and all observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong on all counts.  You’re attributing to evolutionary &lt;em&gt;biology&lt;/em&gt; the sins of “evolutionary &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt;“, which is a nascent field still under development and beset by too many ideologues for its own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “predicts” the existence of hospitals as well as their destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stopped trying to use &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt; phenomena to attach &lt;em&gt;biology,&lt;/em&gt; you might look less like a benighted idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, during the so-called Dark Ages, European technology and science overtook and surpassed the rest of the world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by “the rest of the world” you exclude Arab Spain, T’ang China and Mesoamerica, then yes, you might have a point. (If you try to claim Andalusia as part of “Christian Europe”, then you’re an even more blithering moron than I had imagined.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake went on to deliver several more hilarious bitch-slaps, and therefore he is our winner. Additional kudos go to everyone else in that thread who was valiantly representing reality. Blake, please let me know what you’d like to ask for your special prize: Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember folks, nominate your favorite comment by quoting it (using the little arrow next to it) and writing “COTW!” in your response.&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, it’s not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to prevent STI’s.  Abstinence is one way, but it involves an amputation of sorts—the removal of a critical human behavior.  Another amputation (of sorts) that prevents STIs is circumcision.  Male circumcision has been found in several good studies to reduce the rate of HIV transmission, and now a study out of Uganda shows a significant decrease in rates of genital herpes infections (HSV-2), human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (the strains that cause penile, cervical, and anal cancer), but no decrease in syphilis infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Circumcision_Sakkara_1.jpg" title="Egyptian circumcision"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study complements the our knowledge on the benefits of circumcision to prevent disease.  The authors emphasize that circumcision alone is not &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt;, but may be a useful adjunct to prevent serious STIs.  In fact, STI’s tend to travel together, and ulcerative diseases such as herpes increase transmission of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now people get a little touchy about male circumcision.  Despite the lack of data to show negative effects, there is a reasonable question to be asked as to whether the removal of the foreskin, whatever benefit may accrue, is worth any loss of sexual pleasure that may result.  This is a tough outcome to study.  Most males are circumcised as infants and know no different.  However, a small study was published in the Journal of Urology a few years back that asked an interesting question: if you circumcise an adult male, what differences will he report?  In the study published, they found that men reported decreased erectile function, decreased penile sensitivity, but &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has its limitations of course, but what it did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; find was a group of terribly unhappy men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is quite clear; circumcision effectively prevents the transmission of a number of important diseases, and used in congress with condoms has a great potential to reduce the plagues killing millions of people yearly.  What has yet to be answered is whether the human cost of circumcision, whatever that may be, justifies its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This post is very delayed, but things have been busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'm working my way up to finger trees, which are a wonderful
functional data structure. They're based on trees - and like many
tree-based structures, their performance relies heavily on the balance
of the tree. The more balanced the tree is, the better they perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In general, my preference when I need a balanced tree is a red-black
tree, which I wrote about before. But there are other kinds of balanced trees,
and for finger trees, many people prefer a kind of tree called a 2/3 tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A two-three tree is basically a B-tree with a maximum of two values per node.
If you don't know  what a B-tree is, don't worry. I'm going to explain all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A two-three tree is a tree where each node contains either one or two values. If
the node isn't a leaf, then its number of children is one more than its number
of values. The basic value constraints are the same as in a binary search tree: 
smaller values to the left, larger values to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The big difference in the 2/3 tree is balance: it's got a much stronger
balance requirement. In a 2/3 tree, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; path from the tree root to the leaves
is exactly the same length. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paul and Deborah Rees, who are both self-styled mediums, have been awarded the cash under the Government&amp;#39;s Want2Work job creation scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couple, from Bridgend, south Wales, will use it to instruct people on how to contact friends and relatives &amp;quot;on the other side&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics are astonished that the award was approved by the Department of Work and Pensions bureaucrats, and now the Welsh Assembly has launched an investigation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mediums themselves confess to being &amp;quot;surprised&amp;quot; at securing the grant. But they insist that the &amp;quot;mere £4,500&amp;quot; of public money will be put to good use at their centre, the Accolade Academy of Psychic and Mediumistic Studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The psychics themselves were &amp;quot;surprised&amp;quot; at securing the grant?  Well, they can’t be very good psychics then, can they?  I have to say, I’m not that surprised at anything that happens when the government is involved.  Remember how two years ago &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/02/stargate_projec.html"&gt;UK Ministry of Defence spent £18,000&lt;/a&gt; ($35,000) on experiments to discover if psychic powers exist?  And don’t forget how the US government wasted $20 million on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stargate"&gt;Stargate&lt;/a&gt;.  Against that, £4,500 is small change.  But hey, if the UK government is throwing money at this, perhaps I can get in on the act.  I already have a proven method to make it appear you are communicating with the dead.  It’s a list of proven techniques that includes a handy &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/11/john-edward-jam.html"&gt;bingo card&lt;/a&gt; to make it more fun.  Where do I apply for my cash?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f6e1466970b-pi" style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deborah-Rees_1372914c" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201156f6e1466970b-800wi" title="Deborah-Rees_1372914c"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while we wait to see just how big of fools the Texas State Board of Education wants to make themselves look (the verdict so far: &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/live-blogging-the-final-science-vote-in-texas-ii/"&gt;pretty big&lt;/a&gt;), it turns out &lt;a href="http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/mar/27/evolution-bill-quietly-filed-state-senate/"&gt;Florida is busily trepanning themselves as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this is not a repeat from 2008, 2007, 2006, or even 1216, as much as it sounds like the Dark Ages.&lt;br&gt;

If you’re scratching your head, wondering how on (the 4.55 billion year old) Earth anyone can possibly want to teach creationism in the schools, then I suggest you read the comments on any of my previous few posts on this topic. There you will see people saying things like, &amp;quot;It’s only a theory!&amp;quot; (no, &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html"&gt;it’s a theory and a fact&lt;/a&gt;), and &amp;quot;Science is faith-based too!&amp;quot; (no, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/02/18/is-science-faith-based/"&gt;it’s not&lt;/a&gt;), and &amp;quot;You hate Christians&amp;quot; (no, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/creationism-is-bad-religion/"&gt;I don’t&lt;/a&gt;, and I don’t even hate creationists, just what they’re doing), and really lots of other blatant lies and ridiculous accusations that are trivially easy to prove wrong… like every creationist claim, come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, creationists: if you personally want to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that the Earth is 6000 years old, despite a veritable mountain of evidence against it and nothing at all to support it, then you have that right. But when you want to vote your fantasy into legislation or into the schoolbooks, &lt;strong&gt;that’s wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. And no matter how much you shout and bloviate and spread your manure, you’ll still be wrong. That’s how reality really works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238178302511"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6523">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f007628bbcb0348b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contests"/><title type="html">Calling All Freakonometricians</title><published>2009-03-27T18:47:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T18:47:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/rcjme785R0o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/calling-all-freakonometricians/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| A challenge for our readers: the Fraser Institute is offering a $1,000 top prize for proposals on what economic or public policy issue it should try to measure.

The new rules and new cars make it really difficult to predict anything, but I try to make a few predictions at the start of every season, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferarri will win the Constructor’s championship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenson will get some points in early races but they’ll dry up as other teams get up to speed with the new regs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max Mosely will continue to cling tenaciously to his position despite mounting opposition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Webber will say bad words in at least 3 post-race interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kimi and Felipe will tie for race wins, but Felipe will win on points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kimi will say even less than last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BMW will be the second best team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewis and Fernando will be battling each other for most of the season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three Sebastiens will give the commentators headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Braun will sponsor Brawn (well they should!)&lt;/li&gt;

Although &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php"&gt;Orac &lt;/a&gt;professed some (perhaps for dramatic effect) surprise that the HuffPo has sunk to such pseudoscientific depths, I confess I was not surprised. This is on a par with the antivaccinationist crankery that has found a home at HuffPo and the occasional Chopra nonsense. Any publication with the lax journalistic standards that would allow such rabid antivaccinationist nonsense to be published under its banner is capable of almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pilly is now offering is the claim that distant healing effects are real based upon poorly referenced and cherry picked data, abject naivete as to the nature of research, and the usual handwaving explanations invoking (or course) quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Claim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pillay claims there is good evidence that distant healing effects are real. The effect, he claims, is due to “intention” - which is a euphamism for “wishing”, which means he is talking about magic. If everyone in the audience says they believe in faires, then Tinkerbell will come back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For evidence Pillay cites a study alleging to show that one member of a couple can influence the autonomic function of their partner in a separate room. Unbelievably Pillay did not give the reference, and had to be brow  beat in the comments to do so. I found the &lt;a href="http://deanradin.blogspot.com/2008/07/compassionate-intention-paper-published.html"&gt;study abtract online&lt;/a&gt;.  (Orac was sent the full version by a reader, so had access to more details). It turns out the study was performed by Dean Radin, which might explain Pillay’s reluctance to give the reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radin has a reputation for creatively massaging data, and other researchers have a hard time replicating his claims for positive results. From the abtract of this study he write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned differences in skin conductance among the three groups were not significant, but a post hoc analysis showed that peak deviations were largest and most sustained in the trained group, followed by more moderate effects in the wait group, and still smaller effects in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a skeptical eye toward any study such as this there are two basic questions that need to be answered - was their adequate blinding, and is the signal in the data real or the result of fudging, cherry picking or bias. Regarding blinding, Orac brings up excellent points - the person receiving the intention was being watched by a remote camera during periods of intention, so perhaps the little red light on the camera came on and clued them in. No attempt was made to verify that the recipient was properly blinded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the quote above from the abstract is perhaps even more of a problem. I interpret that to mean - the agreed upon outcome measures were negative, so I went back and looked at the data again (post hoc) and was able to massage an apparent effect out of the noise. Radin is known for doing multiple fancy statistical manipulations of the data, as he did in this case, and spinning gold out of straw. He also discarded a few bits of data as “artifacts” which is further suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that this is a dubious study by a researcher with a dedicated ideology and a poor history. I would not even begin to take this research seriously until it was independently replicated by more respected and skeptical researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pillay, however, is ready to rewrite the physics textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Woo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having prematurely concluded that intention magic is real, Pillay offers these possibilities as to mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) that intention is transmitted by an as yet unknown energy signal;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) that intention warps space-time much like gravity, creating pathways for connection;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) that people, like particles are described in quantum physics, have instantaneous correlations across distance;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) that intention is much like measurement in quantum physics. It organizes random possibilities much like how wave functions can be collapsed into a single function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first option - an unknown energy signal - is almost the equivalent of saying “by magic.”  First, the room in which the receiver sat was extensively shielded. So this unknown energy must have some unusual properties - it can go through heavy shielding but will interact with soft biology. It also, apparently, can be generated by the human brain. Until such a candidate energy is detected and something is known about its characteristics, and it is plausibly tied to biological creation and effects - this option does not deserve to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the equivalent of  Larry Arnold inventing the new subatomic particle he dubbed the “pyron” to explain spontaneous human combustion. First, he failed to demonstrate the phenomenon is real, and second you just can’t make up the physics as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second choice is intention warps space-time. Wow - that is some serious woo. Well, I guess if Hiro can do it on the Heroes, it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he goes into the typical quantum woo, completely misunderstanding quantum mechanics. There are two basic reasons that quantum weird effects do not apply to people (and for all those physics majors out there, forgive my oversimplification, but these are the key concepts as I understand them). The first is that as particles interact with other particles any quantum non-locality or entanglement is effectively lost. This is called decoherence. For that reason quantum effects just don’t apply to people. Or (as Michio Kaku said when I &lt;a href="http://theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=182"&gt;interviewed him on the SGU&lt;/a&gt;) it does, but you would have to wait longer than the age of the universe for any quantum effects to manifest. In fact I specifically asked Michio if quantum mechanics allows for any new age woo, and he said unequivocally no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason quantum effects do not apply to people is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie_hypothesis"&gt;de Broglie wavelength&lt;/a&gt;. Louis de Broglie won the Nobel prize in 1929 for his work in quantum mechanics deriving the formula for calculating the effective wavelength of an electron. His equation actually applies to any physical object, including a person. The de Broglie wavelength of anything is equal to Planck’s constant (6.626 x10^-34) divided by the object’s momentum. For electrons, this gives a sizable wavelength. The bigger an object the smaller the de Broglie wavelength, and for macroscopic objects it is insignificantly small. This determines in essence the degree of quantum uncertainty, which is so tiny we can ignore it for macroscopic objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line - quantum effects cannot be invoked to explain the magic of intention. Sorry, Pillay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again we see a pattern of a believer who credulously accepts the reality of a phenomenon based upon cherry picked, flawed, and vastly insufficient evidence. They then prematurely propose mechanisms for the alleged phenomenon which turn out to be just fancy ways of saying “magic” or butchering existing science. The science butchered is usually cutting edge stuff poorly understood by the public - and today, hands down, that is quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an epic science failure for Pillay and the Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boston Latin vampires have been all over the interpages since &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/03/26/bostonist_psa_how_to_spot_vampires.php"&gt;the Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; reported yesterday that school admins were rushing to cover up for the fact that unholy demons were lurking their halls. Today, &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/27/vampire_rumors_spur_alert_at_boston_latin___on_bullying/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed3"&gt;the official word&lt;/a&gt; is that this is probably more about bullying and rampant rumors of kids cutting themselves and others in an attempt to be Gothier than thou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As silly as the whole story is, and as jokey as all the media coverage has been, this is a really interesting and prime example of how myths get started. Often, myths and legends can spring from our attempt to explain something we don’t understand and sometimes to dehumanize and spurn people who are seen as “other.” In this case, the narrative seems to have evolved from “Goth kids are weird” to “Goth kids are pretending their vampires” to “Goth kids &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; vampires.” People tend not to suddenly believe something absurd – instead, each step follows more or less logically from the previous step, until we get to the point where the Boston Globe is writing things like “. . . a male student, rumored to be a werewolf, had threatened on Facebook . . ..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the last time New England saw a bit vampire craze, back in the late 1700s (at which point Boston Latin was already a good 150 years old). In this case, the big lurking mystery was consumption, which we now know as tuberculosis.

The 'strengths and weaknesses' amendment lost on points, but the creationists responded with a flurry  of &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/science-under-siege-in-texas/"&gt;new amendments&lt;/a&gt; to various &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/03/creationist_amendments.php"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; of the  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/03/earth_and_space_science_amendm.php"&gt;science standards&lt;/a&gt; — most of them look like very nit-picky changes in wording that have deep meaning to creationists, I assume. Science wasn&amp;#39;t murdered by the Texas board, but is only being wounded and made to suffer the torture of a thousand cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/science-takes-hits-in-texas/"&gt;Texas Freedom Network has released a summary statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word "weaknesses" no longer appears in the science standards.  But the document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Through a series of contradictory and convoluted amendments, the board crafted a road map that creationists will use to pressure publishers into putting phony arguments attacking established science into textbooks.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We appreciate that the politicians on the board seek compromise, but don't agree that compromises can be made on established mainstream science or on honest education policy.    
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What's truly unfortunate is that we now have to revisit this entire debate in two years when new science textbooks are adopted. Perhaps the Texas legislature can do something to prevent that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no longer confused, just unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/texas_confuses_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/a_UbUNs1n5g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238173693571"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/there_is_eloquence_in_darkness">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9cfc812baae5fd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">There is Eloquence in Darkness</title><published>2009-03-27T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/there_is_eloquence_in_darkness" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sektordua/326195832/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/326195832_ed8242f058_m.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I recently received an email from a close autistic friend of mine. It was neither a plea for help nor a pity party, but more a cry for justice and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't overwhelmed. I can "work" (meaning being employed) but not be able to maintain relationships or self-care. Or I can maintain relationships but at the expense of working and self-care, or some other combo that is not all-three-things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Security won't pay for me to live while I attend to the other stuff because I've worked in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social programs won't provide me with an assistant, only with "skill trainers," which doesn't actually help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm stuck just attending to whatever the crisis of the moment is. I do that until I crash out and spend a few months catatonic. Then it starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meltdowns--or shutdowns--are an absence of feeling. They are a fight-or-flight response to a situation that simply cannot be coped with on any level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I'm so passionate about advocacy is because I don't want autistic people who come after me to live like I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend works himself to the bone. Envisioning my friend in a catatonic state is painful to me because not only is he dear to me, but I depend on him for support and guidance. Unfortunately, I cannot help my friend because his needs require service at a higher level than what I can provide. That noted, my friend neither needs pity nor does he wish to be cured. He simply needs greater public understanding, positive and empowering support, and meaningful legal change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What upsets me most, is that my friend is just one of thousands of autistics dealing with the above issues in life. We wake up and perform tasks such as working, blogging, advocating, attending conferences, facilitating meetings, and forging contacts. Then we go to sleep--late--only to wake up and do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes we have seen to fruition, in unison with current atrocities, provide our fuel. This is but a small first course in the larger feast ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does one respond to such an honest baring of the soul? Though my friend's world is at times dark and confusing, it lacks not of eloquence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to my friend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems there are no safe choices, only different ones. We all have challenges--autistic or not--and that's okay. It's okay because it has to be. I often remind myself that in every end, there is also a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your orchestration of thunder is not conducted for nothing. There is an uneven distribution of power at play. I often feel as if I am constructing a house of cards, of which one wrong move will send the whole structure tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandj98/307960000/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/117/307960000_293ae59a66_m.jpg" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As &lt;a href="http://aspitude.blogspot.com/2009/03/world-autism-interviews-melissa_15.html"&gt;Melissa Barton&lt;/a&gt; wrote, "What a war. Please send reinforcements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large percentage of autistic individuals are in need of appropriate education, acceptance and integration, opportunity, legal protection, housing, employment, and quality health care. We are thankful to those who join hands with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring's finally reached Stockholm! To celebrate, here's a song by one of the city's finest folk singers, &lt;a href="http://stefansundstrom.se/"&gt;Stefan Sundström&lt;/a&gt;, off of his 1992 album &lt;i&gt;Happy Hour Viser&lt;/i&gt;, "Happy Hour Songs". I translate:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spring Samba&lt;br&gt;
By Stefan Sundström&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning when he awoke spring was already here&lt;br&gt;
He was bleary, tired and hung over, pretty bedraggled&lt;br&gt;
She got in through the window like a crazy samba in April&lt;br&gt;
And took him right there, no ifs ands or buts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She danced around the room like a stoned tornado&lt;br&gt;
Like a fairy there to wake the mountain trolls&lt;br&gt;
And she ran up to the window and yelled "Our time is now!"&lt;br&gt;
And she stretched her arms wide to the sun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus: Then he said, "Watch out, you might get burned&lt;br&gt;
Watch out"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there he was in the pollen storm, caught red-handed&lt;br&gt;
With his winter's introverted snowballing&lt;br&gt;
The flies in the window had suffocated from the dust in there&lt;br&gt;
Tired of midnight buzzing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sitting around getting poisoned like Indian Faqirs&lt;br&gt;
And talking crap for hours about this and that&lt;br&gt;
After he'd gotten hooked on love, always unrequited&lt;br&gt;
He happily ran head first into the wall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asked her about a lot of things she didn't know&lt;br&gt;
All she said was "Too much love will only hurt you"&lt;br&gt;
But he refused to believe it, yeah, he couldn't believe it&lt;br&gt;
And they didn't care what would happen next&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorus: And they sang, "But watch out, you might get burned&lt;br&gt;
Watch out"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now spring was here and swept away every trace&lt;br&gt;
of all the pain way down beneath the snow&lt;br&gt;
And she was zipping around his place throwing up dust clouds from the floor&lt;br&gt;
Someone had to do it after his hibernation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had to hurry to the train because there wouldn't be many more of them&lt;br&gt;
He was half asleep standing on the platform&lt;br&gt;
And she left heading for the spring&lt;br&gt;
And he went home and wrote this song&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he sang, "Watch out, you might get burned&lt;br&gt;
Watch out&lt;br&gt;
You gotta look out, my child&lt;br&gt;
Watch out, you might get burned&lt;br&gt;
Watch out"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/swedish_folkie_greets_spring.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/jXgTGJ4ReX0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238171567997"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/crumbling-media/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2cc6c1a4459d4af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><title type="html">Crumbling media</title><published>2009-03-27T16:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T16:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/crumbling-media/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, the science journal Nature &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html"&gt;had an article about the decline of mainstream media for science journalism&lt;/a&gt;. The Columbia Journal Review picked up on that, and &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/natures_artificial_divide.php?page=al"&gt;posted an interesting article about ti themselves&lt;/a&gt;. It features a discussion of our very own Hive Overmind, Discover Magazine blogs, including statements by Carl Zimmer, who writes &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/"&gt;The Loom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t have too much to add here, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/09/13/the-evolution-of-revolution/"&gt;mostly because I’ve said it before&lt;/a&gt;. Print media is dying, and people are analyzing it to death, but the cause is clear: for the most part, old media simply doesn’t get new media. They don’t understand it. They tried to take their content and just dump it online, but that didn’t work, and it took them too long to figure out why. Seed magazine understood it and created ScienceBlogs, and our own Discover Magazine figured it out as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love reading magazines and newspapers, but you know what? &lt;strong&gt;Things change&lt;/strong&gt;. I bet there are lots of folks who miss elevator operators and phones with real dials, too. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not being flippant here. In this case there is a major economic impact as well as major impacts on people’s lives. But just because something is pervasive and liked doesn’t mean it has to or will last forever. The Internet changed things suddenly and catastrophically (by some viewpoints), and this is a non-reversible process. There was plenty of time to adapt, to evolve, but it was too hard for too many big media to do it, but easy enough for individuals. That’s why so many scientists blog now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print media is the first, but it won’t be the last. Movies and radio are still trying to fight new media instead of embrace it, and their day is coming too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a threat. That is the sound of inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238171163476"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6627">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf2be284f93d0443</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">TSBE Science Standards Final Vote Today</title><published>2009-03-27T15:31:32Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T15:31:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6627" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to overwhelm you with posts about the Texas State Board of Education &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6476"&gt;voting on science standards&lt;/a&gt;, but the final vote happens today.

The Internal Revenue Service presumably never likes tax cheats, but when money is tight there is more pressure put on the I.R.S. to step up enforcement and collect more money. The most recent gambit, reported today, is an amnesty program designed to root out offshore tax havens. We once wrote of another I.R.S. measure [...]

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7958582.stm"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; is being led by the SNBTS-Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to take left-over embryos from In Vitro Fertilization and find one that would produce Type O blood. This is the blood type that is the universal donor so tissue rejection does not happen. Anyone can receive type-O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our so-inclined Japanese readers:&lt;br&gt;
Remember…blood type-O people are very social and outgoing&lt;br&gt;
They are Creative and popular, and love to be the center of attention and appear very self confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, back to reality…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified the embryo that has the genetic code for type O blood, you give its stems cells the appropriate nutrients and bam…you have a literal unending supply of mature red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/synthblood1.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="421"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that…blood cells produced this way can’t transmit infections or blood diseases or otherwise taint the blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer as well is not a concern either because red blood cells are anucleated, they don’t have a nucleus. Ever wonder why red blood cells have that unusual depressed-center shape? It’s because the center bulge that carries the dna is ejected during development of the cell. This was a key development during mammalian evolution. Fish, reptiles, and birds have nuclei but they are inactive. Ours allows more hemoglobin to be carried and thus more oxygen which gives us a more efficient metabolism. Pretty cool (and daring) innovation, way to go evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US may have dropped the ball on this one. Last year a U.S. group called Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) used this very technique to produce billions of blood cells. Apparently, they renounced the project due to the limits set up by the Bush administration. Maybe they’ll un-renounce it now that those limits have been raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest hurdle then for the British scientists is one of scale. ACT produced billions of cells which is the record but a liter of blood has about 5 trillion cells or 5000 times the number produced by ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this pans out we may see blood factories in our lifetimes that can be brought to disaster zones and battlefields. The US Dept of defense has stated that it would put one on the back of military vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pesky annoyance for me about this news item was the term “artificial blood” itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is artificial blood in that it is created in the lab and not in a person. But unlike synth bloods in the past, this is as real as it gets. It isn’t some thin green artificial goo that happens to carry oxygen like real blood. This stuff would be indistinguishable from the blood cells you’re making right now.  I’d call it synthetically produced real blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about the green-goo synthetic blood that scientists have been working on for years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of synthetic blood has been the holy grail of blood scientists for quite some time. Imagine no refrigeration and blood typing requirements. One approach has been to use a chemical called perfluorocarbons to hold oxygen and mix in with the blood. This has limited use however since its oxygen carrying capacity is limited. Another approach was to use pure hemoglobin itself as the oxygen carrier. Unfortunately this method presented problems as well. In fact, a recent compilation of clinical trial results from various companies showed a &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-robert-winslow9-2009mar09,0,6342305.story"&gt;30% increase in deaths&lt;/a&gt; from their blood substitute products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it would seem that this new synthetically produced blood using stem cells couldn’t have come at a better time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The &lt;a href="http://www.hairwhisperers.com/"&gt;Hair Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; is a nice name for an unappetizing – but booming – business. Ms. Goldreyer, who lives in Brentwood, Calif., is a lice-removal expert. Parents hire her (and now her staff of a dozen) to make house calls, meticulously check through children’s hair and, if lice are found, treat them with nontoxic products.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are additional companies called the &lt;a title="Their website" href="http://www.texaslicesquad.com/"&gt;Texas Lice Squad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title="the website is about as twee as you&amp;#39;d expect" href="http://www.hairfairies.com/"&gt;Hair Fairies&lt;/a&gt;.  The Lice Squad charges $230 per treatment, BTW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also can find ads for additional lice whisperers at &lt;a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/1003255950.html"&gt;Craig’s list&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently lice are a recession-proof, growth industry.  And, for those who have the cash, it’s much simpler to have someone else do the work for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/jaaj-wcm031209.php"&gt;new paper came out this week&lt;/a&gt; that evaluates the effectiveness of screening for lice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Visual inspection underestimated the true prevalence of active infestation by a factor of 3.5,” the authors write. Wet combing had a significantly higher sensitivity for detecting active infestations, correctly identifying them in 90.5 percent of the children (vs. 28.6 percent for visual inspections).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/3/309"&gt;Here’s the actual peer-reviewed paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Accuracy of Diagnosis of Pediculosis Capitis: Visual Inspection vs Wet Combing.  Claudia Jahnke, et al.   Arch Dermatol. 2009;145(3):309-313.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a nicely done partly blind study with 5 elementary schools.  It also suggests that the “salon” approach to lice combing may be on the right track!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing does trouble me, though–not a single one of the 3 websites I’ve listed here has a kid of color on the site.  Do they know how to deal with “special” hair? Or is that just a reflection of a model that means that only rich (white) kids get the best treatment?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bug Girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://membracid.wordpress.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://membracid.wordpress.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Bug Girl&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238163145497"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/last_extinction_on_pbs.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c67583a76fff2003</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Last Extinction on PBS</title><published>2009-03-27T14:23:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T14:23:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/jRvoc8k4Q68/last_extinction_on_pbs.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/last_extinction_on_pbs.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out the show's &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/clovis/" title=""&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

This would be news to the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/condom.htm"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Research on the effectiveness of latex condoms in preventing heterosexual transmission is both comprehensive and conclusive. The ability of latex condoms to prevent transmission has been scientifically established in laboratory studies as well as in epidemiologic studies of uninfected persons at very high risk of infection because they were involved in sexual relationships with HIV-infected partners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7967173.stm"&gt;Lancet speaks out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the London-based Lancet said the Pope had "publicly distorted scientific evidence to promote Catholic doctrine on this issue".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It said the male latex condom was the single most efficient way to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV/Aids.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Whether the Pope's error was due to ignorance or a deliberate attempt to manipulate science to support Catholic ideology is unclear," said the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it said the comment still stood and urged the Vatican to issue a retraction.
"When any influential person, be it a religious or political figure, makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people, they should retract or correct the public record," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates, including many thousands of Catholics, who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV/Aids worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pope_condemned_by_the_lancet.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DXPGPbcj4Rk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238161249733"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/friday_cephalopod_red_and_poin_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce76d70d3a6571bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Red</title><published>2009-03-27T13:46:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T13:46:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/AVahkM1PZJo/friday_cephalopod_red_and_poin_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/friday_cephalopod_red_and_poin_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/03/sepia_peterseni.jpg" width="425" height="251" alt="sepia_peterseni.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sepia peterseni&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I have a timely question. Which came first–the phrase &amp;quot;field goal&amp;quot; as used in basketball or as used in football? My usual sources are not being helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED gives the gloss "esp. N. Amer. and Austral., (a) in Football, a goal scored from the field of play; (b) in Basketball, a goal scored while the ball is in play; (c) in other games". The citations give the nod to football by four years, but both examples look easy to antedate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1902&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chicago Record-Herald&lt;/em&gt; 28 Sept. 2/3 A try for a field goal was made, but..the kick was easily blocked. &lt;strong&gt;1906 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Off. Bk. Rules Govt. Game of Basketball &lt;/em&gt;1906-1907 13 Flint..has tallied the most field goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, a search in the NYT's online archives produces "&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9501E5DA163AEF33A25752C1A9679D94629FD7CF"&gt;JOHNS HOPKINS BADLY BEATEN.; ITS FOOT-BALL TEAM DEFEATED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY BOYS&lt;/a&gt;", Nov. 11, 1883:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FieldGoal.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FieldGoal.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seriously doubt this is the earliest football-related use. But since James Naismith organized the first basketball game on January 20, 1892 (in the gym at the YMCA in Springfield MA), a bit more than eight years after the date of this story, I think we can take football's priority to be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article raising another question: what was the difference between a "touchdown goal", apparently worth 6 points then as now, and a "touchdown", apparently worth just 2? Was plain &lt;em&gt;touchdown&lt;/em&gt; the term for what's now called a &lt;em&gt;touchback&lt;/em&gt; (which now awards no points to anyone), or was it the equivalent of today's "point-after-touchdown", or what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[There is also either a typographical error or a small problem of arithmetic — after telling us that field goals counted for 2 points each, the reporter includes &amp;quot;one field goal, 5″ in the final tally. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238160759041"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/creationism-is-bad-religion/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/56d5496fab2205c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Creationism is bad religion</title><published>2009-03-27T13:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T13:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/27/creationism-is-bad-religion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s dead obvious that creationism isn’t science, or even bad science. It’s nonsense. But I’ve long stated it’s also bad religion, because it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; take faith, it also takes a phenomenal disregard of reality. Moderate Christians should distance themselves from such garbage, as it is a clear distortion of the Bible. The creation story in Genesis has two self-contradicting versions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBoqKF52FU8"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; pleased me. It’s from a moderate man, a religious one, but one who sees what folly young-Earth creationism is. I recommend watching it. He even points out he disagrees with atheists on things, but in this case he knows creationism is a crock. And with what’s going on Texas right now, what he says is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zBoqKF52FU8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I receive email and comments on my blog from religious people saying I hate Christians. I find that funny, and ironic, given what Jesus said on the Sermon on the Mount contrasted with the commentor’s obvious attitude toward me. Still, that claim is ridiculous. I don’t hate Christians, nor do I ever say that people cannot believe whatever they want. You can believe what you want, including the grossly ridiculous idea that the Earth is 6000 years old. That’s your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that right stops when you try to make laws based on your belief, and when you try to tell an entire country how your religion should be the only thing taught in science class, and when your belief system affects people’s health, welfare, and well-being. Creationism and fundamentalism do just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not sway from my stance that I will not allow laws in this country to be based on a narrow sect’s belief system, whether it aligns with reality or not (and in the case of creationists, it’s way way not).  I will continue to be vocal, I will continue to fight, and I will do what I can to make sure this country stays free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238160691328"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b479c0cff98bc72e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">The Huffington Post delves deeper into the woo</title><published>2009-03-27T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/T8Nh-hk8QDg/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_huffington_post_delves_deeper_into_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since its very inception, the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; has been a &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/antivaccination-rhetoric-running.html"&gt;hotbed of antivaccine&lt;/a&gt; lunacy. Shortly after that, antivaccine woo-meisters like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_osama_bin_laden_vaccine_gambit_revis.php"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/robert_f_kennedy_jr_has_declared_a_crank_1.php"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/the_huffington_post_adds_another_antivac.php"&gt;Kimg Stagliano&lt;/a&gt;, and, apparently, one of the editors (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/the_huffington_post_and_vaccines.php"&gt;Special Projects Editor Rachel Sklar&lt;/a&gt;) were joined by all-purpose woo-meisters like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/choprawoo_and_magical_thinking_two_crapp.php"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;. True, for a brief period of time there appeared to be an occasional voice for vaccines on HuffPo, but they never lasted. After all, RFK, Jr.'s been there nearly four years now and David Kirby almost as long, while pro-vaccine commentary pops up briefly, gets shouted down by the woo-loving antivaccinationists who frequent the comments sections of posts, swooping down like &lt;a href="http://redwing.hutman.net/~mreed/warriorshtm/cybersisters.htm"&gt;Cyber Sisters&lt;/a&gt; (and Brothers) to drive them from the blog. It's not for nothing that I have totally &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/a_science_section_for_the_huffington_pos.php"&gt;scoffed at the idea&lt;/a&gt; of a science section in the HuffPo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, for all the nonsense and pseudoscience nurtured in the pages of Arianna Huffington's little vanity project, there were some places I didn't think even HuffPo would go. There's some woo just so ridiculous that even HuffPo wouldn't touch it. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong. Meet &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay"&gt;Srinivasan Pillay&lt;/a&gt;, "certified master coach, psychiatrist, brain imaging researcher and speaker," whatever that means (other than psychiatrist). As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/03/huffpo_does_it_again.php"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; points out, his "brain imaging" publications in PubMed are pretty darned sparse, mostly functional MRI studies, which are very difficult to do correctly in order to obtain any correlations or useful data. If his HuffPo presence is any indication, I hate to think what he's doing with that fMRI machine. Get aload of his post, forwarded to me by multiple readers, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay/the-science-of-distant-he_b_177986.html"&gt;The Science of Distant Healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woo, it burns.

One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ Woody Allen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No good deed goes unpunished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/"&gt;whatstheharm.net&lt;/a&gt; is a depressing recitation of the harm that humans do to themselves and others from participating in various forms of nonsense in the attempt to do good. It my backfire, and instead pain and death result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would bet that most practitioners of medical woo are true believers. They do not intend to harm people, and believe they are doing good for their patients. Certainly the consumers of alternative therapies intend to have good benefits from their use of sCAM modalities. Most want to get better, and do not intend to hurt themselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, actions always have unintended consequences. Sometimes the harm is directly to the patient. Sometimes the harm in indirect, with collateral damage to people or the environment. My hospital system has an extensive recycling program to handle the huge amounts of waste generated by the need to insure that all manner of materials are sterile. Patients in isolation consume large amounts of paper and plastic to keep infection confined. My hospitals actively look for ways to decrease their environmental impact and carbon footprint and still deliver high quality medical care. &lt;a href="http://www.legacyhealth.org/body.cfm?id=1892"&gt;Legacy Health System&lt;/a&gt;, where I work, is an award winning leader recycling medical waste, which is a lot more difficult to dispose of than the pop cans and paper bags in your house. Hopefully the trash in your house is not covered with pus, blood and other potentially hazardous medical waste. We try to be good global citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if some branches of the alternative medical industrial complex are so environmentally conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural products are at the greatest risk for being adversely affected by a demand for their use. If millions of people want a natural product that has limited supply, soon that product will be exhausted and the product extinct. Adverse effects from alternative therapies can come in many forms, and the alternative practice with the greatest adverse impact on the environment is probably traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). A billion or more people wanting a traditional herbal or animal product is going to have a detrimental effect on the herb or animal being consumed. There are numerous examples of the adverse effects on the environment from traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years the Rhinoceros was hunted not for food or sport, but for the horn. There is a form of magical thinking that derives function from the structure of a natural product like a rhino horn. It looks like a penis. I guess. I must not have been paying close attention during in my urology rotation. Because it looks like a penis, it must have efficacy on impotence. So the rhino horn was ground up to treat impotence. For centuries it was the Enzyte of the world. But Rhino horn is more than an aphrodisiac. Although the rhino horn is no more than a fingernail with extra calcium and phosphorus, the horn has been used in Chinese medicine to treat damn near anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will note here that trying to determine what a given Chinese preparation is ‘really’ used for is an exercise in frustration and, as best as I can determine, there as many uses for each TCM preparation as there are acupuncture points: an infinite number only limited by the imagination of the practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It (rhino horn) should not be taken by pregnant women; it will kill the fetus. As an antidote to poisons (in Europe it was said to fall to pieces if poison were poured into it). To cure devil possession and keep away all evil spirits and miasmas. For gelsemium [jasmine] and snake poisoning. To remove hallucinations and bewitching nightmares. Continuous administration lightens the body and makes one very robust. For typhoid, headache, and feverish colds. For carbuncles and boils full of pus. For intermittent fevers with delirium. To expel fear and anxiety, to calm the liver and clear the vision. It is a sedative to the viscera, a tonic, antipyretic. It dissolves phlegm. It is an antidote to the evil miasma of hill streams. For infantile convulsions and dysentery. Ashed and taken with water to treat violent vomiting, food poisoning, and overdosage of poisonous drugs. For arthritis, melancholia, loss of the voice. Ground up into a paste with water it is given for hematemesis [throat hemorrhage], epistaxis [nosebleeds], rectal bleeding, heavy smallpox, etc. (1)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that ‘etc.’ at the end. I thought Bayer aspirin was the wonder drug that works wonders, but aspirin will not calm the evil miasma of hill streams, mores the pity. With all the alleged benefits of consuming rhino horn, all with no biologic plausibility whosoever, it is no wonder that despite the advent of Viagra and its cousins, the rhino is still being hunted for its horn. A century ago, there were one million black rhinos in Africa; now there are 2,500 and the population is falling (2). A horn fetches $500 in a country where the average farmers makes $1.50 a day (2a). On the international market a horns gets more than $10,000 for a kilogram. No wonder the Rhino is hunted to near extinction. The fact that they have no medicinal benefit does not prevent the harvesting of the rhino. All species eventually become extinct, but to become extinct because of medical woo is particularly depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhinos are not the the only animal disappearing due to relentless harvesting of animal parts for worthless therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tigers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1900 there were 100,000 tigers in India, now there are less than 5,000. China now has under 100 tigers, as they are killed and chopped up into their constituent parts for many worthless medical therapies, including, but not limited to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;” a tiger’s penis soaked in alcohol is said to increase virility; its nose suspended over the marriage bed is believed to increase the chance of having a boy and its whiskers are said to cure toothache (4).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCM loves the tiger bones, something that the tiger cannot live without, as a treatment for arthritis, often as a tiger bone wine. 14% of the US has some form of arthritis, and if the numbers are true for China, there are 172 million potential customers for tiger bones. There are also many people outside of China who use the therapy as well. That’s a lot of tiger bones, and given declining tiger populations, it is no wonder tiger bones go for 400 dollars a kilogram, each tiger having 4.5 kilograms of bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The usual dosage for Tiger bone taken orally to treat rheumatic pain is three to six grams daily. At this rate, a daily user of Tiger bone would consume one to two kilos of bone per year. Extrapolated further, the world’s remaining Tigers would provide, at most, a year’s supply of medicine to 125 800 daily users - the equivalent of far less than even 1% of China’s human population (13).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be about 1/3 a tiger per year per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a minor problem: “More than 150,000 over-the-counter traditional Chinese medicines containing - or purporting to contain - tiger bone and parts from other critically endangered species are sold in the United States (4).” Support TCM, you are indirectly supporting the extinction of rhinos and tiger and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tigers are harvested to extinction, traditional Chinese medicine has substituted other big cats like leopards, whose days are now probably numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In traditional clinical practice, bear bile was used in fever fighting, detoxification, inflammation, swelling and pain reduction. It was also used in the cure of carbuncle of heat type, pyocutaneous diseases, hemorrhoid, overabundance of liver-fire, convulsion caused by the overabundance of heat, epilepsy, tic, and redness of eyes due to liver heat etc (15).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again that pesky etc. Pick a disease, real or imagined, and bear bile may be a therapy. The one problem not treated with bear bile that I could find is impotence, the only TCM animal product not used for some sort of sexual dysfunction. The producers and consumers of TCM products seem to have a lot of sexual dysfunction. Cause or effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than hunt bears, farmers keep bears in cages with a catheter in their gall bladder where they can drain the bile like sap from a maple tree. It is not a good life for the bear and often fatal. The Chinese have hundreds of farms with thousands of bears, as do other SE Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an active ingredient in bear bile, ursodeoxycholic acid, that dissolves gall stones. It can be, and is, synthesized for human use. Oddly enough, the natural product is considered superior to synthesized molecule, and so the bile drainage continues and the bear population in China continues to dwindle to supply bear for the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would be agree with PETA on anything, but torturing bears for bile that does nothing or has a synthetic equivalent hardly seems like an ethical treatment of an animal. The Humane Society description of bear bile harvesting does not appear particularly pleasant for the bear, which has its bile ‘milked’ without the benefit of anesthesia (14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;” An un-sterile latex or stainless steel catheter was inserted through the external fistula directly into the gall bladders of each bear to drain the fluid daily either by gravity into a tray or by suction with an un-sterile syringe. This extraction method was called the “Free-dripping Fistula Technique”. The fluid was then dried and manufactured as “Bear Bile Powder” (Bear bile extraction) . The bears were suffering extreme pain due to daily bile extractions. Many of them often die from illnesses (such as cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, polyp formation, obstruction of the cystic duct, strictures and partial herniation of the gall bladder wall, liver cancer) and chronic infections caused by the presence of foreign bodies and their open wounds (15).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides bear farms, bears are illegally hunted for their gallbladders all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual dose of bear bile is 0.25–2.5 g is taken as a pill or powder (15), and given that the average bear in a farm makes 20 to 40 ml a day of milked bile, it takes a lot of bears to provide the required bile. Prices vary, but bear bile can go for $1000 dollars for 250 cc. In beer talk, that would be about half a pint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1970 one kilo of bear gall bladder cost around US $200, but by 1990 the price had risen to between US $3,000 and US $5,000 per kilo. Recent market price with legal certification has risen to between US $30,000 and US $50,000 per kilo (our experience in legal market of Hong Kong) (15).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable financial incentive to hunt bears to extinction to provide worthless medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese are not the only culture who uses nonsense to help drive animals into extinction. 100 million sharks are killed every year. Some are killed as a by product of fishing, some for food, some for sharks fin soup, and some for medication. Somewhere along the line it was mistakenly thought that sharks do not get cancer. They do get cancer, and they get cancer of cartilage, albeit not very frequently. William Lane, PhD has been the primary marketing force behind the idea that shark cartilage can prevent and treat cancer, publishing books on the topic and selling shark products. Again, there was no good reason to suggest that shark cartilage had anti-tumor effects, although some data in the lab suggests that it inhibits the formation of new blood vessels, needed to support tumor growth. The clinical trials for any efficacy of shark cartilage in the treatment of cancer have been negative, but the end result was has been to help push 126 shark species towards extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google search reveals many organic/natural/ online pharmacies sell shark cartilage. I suppose extinction is natural and organic, and supporting and profiting from the extinction of animal species is also natural and organic. Who cares is Jaws is going extinct? Not the purveyors of shark cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saiga antelope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These animals have been hunted for their horns, which are used to treat stroke, colds and high blood pressure, and, since rhino horn is both expensive and rare, a cheaper alternative to rhino horn. Because of the protection of the rhino combined with their tiny numbers, the practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have had to find another species to decimate for useless medical therapy. As a result their numbers of Saiga have gone from 1 million to under 30,000 and falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turtles and Tortoises&lt;/strong&gt; (7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the 90 turtle species in Southeast Asia are endangered, due to demand in China for turtle meat and traditional medicines. “The World Conservation Fund has documented the rapid decline in just the last few years of the Chinese three-striped box turtle, whose fat, used in soup and jelly, is believed to cure cancer; only a few colonies of the once-abundant turtle now survive in the wild (9).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sea horses&lt;/strong&gt; (8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There approximately 90 health and medicine products containing sea horse are sold in China and elsewhere. As is often the case, the sea-horses are being used for, among other things, an aphrodisiac. . To meet this demand some 20,000,000 sea horses are harvested each year. All die for no valid reason, and seahorse stocks are plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other animals consumed by traditional Chinese medicine include the slow loris, whose fur is believed to accelerate healing of wounds. Extracts from the eyeballs of the loris are turned into a love potion. The civet cat is used for its anal scent gland to induce abortions well as to treat arthritis, stimulating blood flow, and increasing libido. Again with the impotence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, it is not just the Chinese that use animal parts for medicinal purposes, but the effects are the best documented due to the large population and the economic clout that allows the trade in medical animal parts to flourish. India, Brazil, and Sudan are a few of the countries with documented use of local plants and animals for medicinal purposes (16), however they have not (yet) had a documented adverse effect on the local ecosystems.&lt;br&gt;
Data suggests in Brazil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of the total of species recorded, 24 (71%) are not under extinction risk. On the other hand, Myrmecophaga tridactyla (Linnaeus 1758), Coendou cf. prehensilis (Linnaeus 1758), Dusicyon sp., Mazama cf. Americana (Erxleben 1777), Rhea americana (Linnaeus 1758), and Crypturellus noctivagus zabele (Spix) 1825, which are officially considered as threatened species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (1989), were found among the set of faunistic resources prescribed as medicines at the time of this research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is good money in the trade of animals, even to the point where the director of the Berlin zoo was selling ‘extra’ tigers to the Chinese for medical use (10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants have it worse than animals, feeding the voracious appetite for traditional Chinese medicine. Over 400 plants are at risk for extinction from medical use as 5 billion people use plants as the basis for their medical care, although not all of them from traditional Chinese medicine. Examples include, but are not limited to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnolia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the world’s species of magnolias are under threat of extinction, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat cancers and slow down the onset of heart disease (12). There are two diseases with similar pathophysiology: cancer and heart disease. I can see why they have the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manchurian Ginseng&lt;/strong&gt; (13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular treatment for memory function as well as cancer, COPD, diabetes, fatigue, increasing libido (where it that etc. when I need it?), Ginseng has all but been eradicated in China and Korea. As a result it is harvested in the US and sent to China. Wild ginseng is though to have better medicinal properties than farm raised, so the harvest of wild ginseng continues in the US, threatening that species with extinction in the US as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dendrobium candidum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An orchid that is believed to cure hoarseness, is so rare that it now costs 12,000 times more than wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licorice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licorice root is an Asian plant species commonly used for pain relief and to treat coughs, skin infections, food and drug poisoning. Licorice is almost wiped out in China - “largely at the hands of Chinese soldiers making some pocket money by digging up the plant while on duty in the country’s northern border region, which is called by some the “licorice zone”(6). Due to excessive harvesting and habitat destruction, licorice root is now grown in less than half its previous area; reduced from 50,000 square miles to about 19,000 square miles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just the tip of the iceberg as “of the 1,581 species of animals used as a medical resource, 1,306 are terrestrial animals and 275 are marine animals… 11,146 are of plant origin (5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the complaints about natural herbal medications is that there is uncertainty as to what the concentration of active products, if any, are. It is argued that a superior way to treat disease is to isolate the active ingredient and then synthesize it. Herbalist of all stripe reply that one needs the complex formulation of the natural product for efficacy. No natural/herbal product I am aware of is superior to the synthesized pure product and none of the synthesized products lead to animal or plant extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are, perhaps, at the beginning of a mass extinction of animal and plant species for a variety of reasons. That we are wiping out ginseng and tigers and bears for the myth that they can cure or treat disease, that these plants and animals are dying out because of belief in magic, is evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese practitioners object to interference and criticism of their practice, feeling it is racist for the West to put limits on Eastern practices that we do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, we would like to point out that recent campaigns against the use of some of our medical resources, for example tiger bones, bear bile and rhino horns, have led to a negative stereotyping of our practice…As part of a scheme in recent history to cast the then Chinese herbalists as ‘the other’, their use of animal material medica has been exploited in the past to devalue the yao they use, and in the process, devalue and delegitimize their medical practice (5).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is racist to be against unproven, implausible magic that is leading to the extinction of hundreds of animal and plant species. Special pleading to allow the pointless extinction and torture of animals for worthless medical therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a movement to make traditional Chinese medicine sustainable, by using alternative worthless products instead of endangered medically worthless products. There are arguments that the bear bile farms are helping prevent the bears from being hunted to extinction, a sort sort of greening TCM induced extinction. Traditional Chinese Medicines is the Hummer of the altmed world, trying to sustain the a destructive practice despite its causing more harm than good to the world. It could be an unexpected byproduct of the adoption of science based medicine that rhinos and tigers and bears would be saved from TCM induced extinction. Perhaps the rational use of science derived evidence will make the TCM therapies will go the way of acupuncture….. bad example. One would hope that if science would demonstrate that the therapies are worthless or that there are synthetic alternatives, that the march of the tiger and rhino towards oblivion would be halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is an increasingly precious resource in the world, and will become even more so as the glacier melt that provides water to large numbers of people disappear with the glaciers. I have read that future wars in the mideast may be over water not oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of water to make a homeopathic concoction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this quote, from the Australian &lt;a href="http://www.acahf.org.au/articles/hyperb2.htm"&gt;Councils Against Health Care Fraud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Homeopathic vaccines – (A) little bottle of water contains what the label describes as a homeopathic vaccine against meningococcal disease. As if that lie is not enough, the label also contains a claim which puts the product in breach of consumer protection and fair trading laws. It says that this preparation is “200C”, but if that is the case then the manufacture of this single bottle would have involved 800 manufacturing steps (excluding packaging) and would have produced 495 litres of waste water. (To produce a single year’s worth of “vaccine” doses would require 73% of the water needed to produce all of the Coca Cola consumed in Australia in a year.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently they drink a lot of Coke down under. To make one 200C vial of meningococcal vaccine would take as much water as a 50 minute shower with a low flow shower head. That is a lot of wasted water (17). Multiply that by the hundreds of different homeopathic concoctions and you have an enormous amount of water being wasted for no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a moral-ethical question as to where your responsibility ends. We recycle in part because there is a sense that we are responsible for our garbage even after we have thrown it away. A similar sense of responsibility is lacking for our carbon footprint, but growing. I am old enough to remember more politically active times, when one did not eat California grapes or Nestles chocolate because to do so was to support a companies that were ‘evil’. In part I have accepted nothing, not even a piece of pizza, from a drug company in over 25 years because half of drug costs go to support advertising. My patients subsidize the cost of my ‘free’ pizza and I think it is not ethical for my patients to pay more for medications so I can get a free pen or other trash to add to the landfill. Everyone will draw the line as to where their responsibility ends at a different place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bumper sticker reads “Think globally, act locally”. Want to help rhinos and tigers and bears? Don’t support the practices that are driving them to extinction. Support your local traditional Chinese practitioner and you may be inadvertently supporting the extinction of numerous animal and plant species as well as doing nothing to promote your own health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harm of medical woo can extend beyond the damage we do to ourselves and others. It can lead to extinction. As Clint said, “Its a hell of thing to kill a species.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don’t bring up the plane flight to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=401"&gt;SBM conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(17) It has been suggested by others that, given the vast quantities of water needed to make homeopathic concoctions, perhaps they are not really making the preparations with the dilutions like they say they are. In Portland water bills are public knowledge and every year the local paper publishes the top 10 water users. We do not have a homeopathic factory in the city, but might I suggest that if you have one in your city, get the water bill and see how much water they use and compare it to the homeopathic concoction production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005026" title=""&gt;Association of Tinnitus and Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: Hints for a Shared Pathophysiology?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tinnitus is a frequent condition with high morbidity and impairment in quality of life. The pathophysiology is still incompletely understood. Electromagnetic fields are discussed to be involved in the multi-factorial pathogenesis of tinnitus, but data proofing this relationship are very limited. Potential health hazards of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been under discussion for long. Especially, individuals claiming themselves to be electromagnetic hypersensitive suffer from a variety of unspecific symptoms, which they attribute to EMF-exposure. The aim of the study was to elucidate the relationship between EMF-exposure, electromagnetic hypersensitivity and tinnitus using a case-control design. Tinnitus occurrence and tinnitus severity were assessed by questionnaires in 89 electromagnetic hypersensitive patients and 107 controls matched for age-, gender, living surroundings and workplace. Using a logistic regression approach, potential risk factors for the development of tinnitus were evaluated. Tinnitus was significantly more frequent in the electromagnetic hypersensitive group (50.72% vs. 17.5%) whereas tinnitus duration and severity did not differ between groups. Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and tinnitus were independent risk factors for sleep disturbances. However, measures of individual EMF-exposure like e.g. cell phone use did not show any association with tinnitus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005040" title=""&gt;Burst of Young Retrogenes and Independent Retrogene Formation in Mammals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Retroposition and retrogenes gain increasing attention as recent studies show that they play an important role in human new gene formation. Here we examined the patterns of retrogene distribution in 8 mammalian genomes using 4 non-mammalian genomes as a contrast. There has been a burst of young retrogenes not only in primate lineages as suggested in a recent study, but also in other mammalian lineages. In mammals, most of the retrofamilies (the gene families that have retrogenes) are shared between species. In these shared retrofamilies, 14%-18% of functional retrogenes may have originated independently in multiple mammalian species. Notably, in the independently originated retrogenes, there is an enrichment of ribosome related gene function. In sharp contrast, none of these patterns hold in non-mammals. Our results suggest that the recruitment of the specific L1 retrotransposons in mammals might have been an important evolutionary event for the split of mammals and non-mammals and retroposition continues to be an important active process in shaping the dynamics of mammalian genomes, as compared to being rather inert in non-mammals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000329" title=""&gt;'I Look in Your Eyes, Honey': Internal Face Features Induce Spatial Frequency Preference for Human Face Processing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine a photograph showing your friend's face. Although you might think that every single detail in his face matters for recognizing him, numerous experiments have shown that the brain prefers a rather coarse resolution instead. This means that a small rectangular photograph of about 30 to 40 pixels in width (showing only the face from left ear to right ear) is optimal. But why? To answer this question, I analyzed a large number of male and female face images. (The analysis was designed to mimic the way that the brain presumably processes them.) The analysis was carried out separately for each of the internal face features (left eye, right eye, mouth, and nose), which permits us to identify the responsible feature(s) for setting the resolution level, and it turns out that the eyes and the mouth are responsible for setting it. Thus, looking at eyes and mouth at the mentioned coarse resolution gives the most reliable signals for face recognition, and the brain has built-in knowledge about that. Although a preferred resolution level for face recognition has been observed for a long time in numerous experiments, this study offers, for the first time, a plausible explanation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000334" title=""&gt;A Proposal for a Coordinated Effort for the Determination of Brainwide Neuroanatomical Connectivity in Model Organisms at a Mesoscopic Scale&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this era of complete genomes, our knowledge of neuroanatomical circuitry remains surprisingly sparse. Such knowledge is critical, however, for both basic and clinical research into brain function. Here we advocate for a concerted effort to fill this gap, through systematic, experimental mapping of neural circuits at a mesoscopic scale of resolution suitable for comprehensive, brainwide coverage, using injections of tracers or viral vectors. We detail the scientific and medical rationale and briefly review existing knowledge and experimental techniques. We define a set of desiderata, including brainwide coverage; validated and extensible experimental techniques suitable for standardization and automation; centralized, open-access data repository; compatibility with existing resources; and tractability with current informatics technology. We discuss a hypothetical but tractable plan for mouse, additional efforts for the macaque, and technique development for human. We estimate that the mouse connectivity project could be completed within five years with a comparatively modest budget.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000434" title=""&gt;Alliance of Proteomics and Genomics to Unravel the Specificities of Sahara Bacterium Deinococcus deserti&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;D. deserti belongs to the Deinococcaceae, a family of bacteria characterized by an exceptional ability to withstand the lethal effects of DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, UV light, and desiccation. It was isolated from Sahara surface sands, an extreme and nutrient-poor environment, regularly exposed to intense UV radiation, cycles of extreme temperatures, and desiccation. The evolution of organisms that are able to survive acute irradiation doses of 15,000 Gy is difficult to explain given the apparent absence of highly radioactive habitats on Earth over geologic time. Thus, it seems more likely that the natural selection pressure for the evolution of radiation-resistant bacteria was chronic exposure to nonradioactive forms of DNA damage, in particular those promoted by desiccation. Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of a bacterium, D. deserti VCD115, isolated from hot, arid desert surface sand. Accurate genome annotation of its 3,455 genes was guided by extensive proteome analysis in which 1,348 proteins were uncovered after growth in standard conditions. Supplementary genes involved in manganese import, in nutrient import, and in DNA repair were identified and are likely important for survival and adaptation of D. deserti to its hostile environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the first time since starting Blue Frog Gaming I took a little time to totally unplug from the startup. The closest I came previously was my honeymoon, though even then I would sneak down to the main concourse daily, laptop in hand, to answer emails at the cruise ship internet access rate of $73 per minute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time I ignored the inbox and, except for a brief conversation with a good friend who is also one of our investors, forcefully vanquished every thought about how to improve virality with better mini-feed messaging or increase conversions by delaying install buttons. I can’t say the thoughts didn’t keep popping up like plastic moles at an arcade, but I kept hammering them back down with my mental rubber mallet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had lots to keep me occupied out there anyway. From the moment we got to town we were assaulted by the city’s overwhelming despair in light of the new economy. Gambling is said to be recession-proof, but the casinos have spent the last 10 years moving away from their proverbial bread and butter and toward other sources of revenue like restaurants (literal bread and butter), real estate, and shopping. The combination of spring break and March Madness had occupancy rates at 2007 levels, but everybody knew it was temporary. You could see in their eyes that next week they’d be back on their couch watching daytime talk shows instead of collecting tips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rented a condo at The Signature, three new Turnberry-managed towers attached to the MGM, where I had once seriously considered purchasing a suite. When the owner let us into the room, I asked her all about the market and she told me the story with what I could only describe as quiet resignation. It truly made me sad to see it. This wasn’t a parasitic AIG executive sucking at the teat of society. She wasn’t a subprime borrower wanting to live in a much nicer place than her income afforded her. She was a real person who made an investment that, by many, would have been considered a good bet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d bought a condo in the hottest real estate market in the US as an investment, hoping that occupancy rates would remain at least reasonable.  Common wisdom at the time (which had been true since long before most of the town’s residents had left their snowy climates to deal blackjack at the Bellagio) was that no matter how many rooms the city built, tourists would fill them. She’d hoped that over the long term a combination of appreciation and rental revenues would provide her with a little something to help retire on. Now she’s frantically listing the place on sites like Craigslist, trying to recoup the mortgage (which from my estimates wouldn’t happen even with a 100% occupancy rate) or at least some portion thereof.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d taken the same sort of gamble “experts” have been saying was the best way to build wealth for decades, and now she’s in serious trouble because of it. Units that sold originally in the $600k-$750k range are now listed online at $175k, and I hear have been purchased for even less. These people are being crushed, having lost hundreds of thousands, and unsurprisingly many of them are filing bankruptcy, pushing the losses off to the banking system, whose lack of due diligence makes it hard to feel sorry for them. But as an entrepreneur, it really saddens me to see anyone who isn’t a competitor getting smacked upside the head for trying, so I felt bad enough for the owner that I tried to do a little extra room-cleaning before we left.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile across the street at City Center, which is the most expensive non-governmentally financed construction project in history by a factor of three, there isn’t a worker to be seen. The &lt;a href="http://www.rttnews.com/ArticleView.aspx?Id=890710&amp;amp;SMap=1"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and other acts of general desperation have already begun to flow over that one, with pretty much everyone involved either scraping for the cash and/or credit needed to complete it or trying to back out entirely. MGM has begun &lt;a href="http://www.realestatechannel.com/us-markets/vacation-leisure-real-estate-1/treasure-island-hotel-and-casino-mgm-mirage-las-vegas-city-center-infinity-world-development-corp-dubai-world-james-murren-phil-ruffin-alex-finkelstein-577.php"&gt;selling off casinos&lt;/a&gt; just to keep construction moving, and nobody knows how far they’ll have to go to stay afloat. It’s a bet-the-farm project for a company who, like every gaming conglomerate, has a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;amp;chdd=1&amp;amp;chds=1&amp;amp;chdv=1&amp;amp;chvs=maximized&amp;amp;chdeh=0&amp;amp;chdet=1237960745126&amp;amp;chddm=495788&amp;amp;q=NYSE:MGM&amp;amp;ntsp=0"&gt;share price graph&lt;/a&gt; that looks like an inverted “V”, and the people with the chips are asking the dealer if surrenders are allowed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first condo-hotel opening there will be the ridiculously-named &lt;a href="http://www.citycenter.com/residences/residences_vdara.aspx"&gt;Vdara&lt;/a&gt;. My wife says they purposely made the title as close to that of female genitalia as they could get away with. If so, it’s ironic that they chose the body part they did since the whole project is a giant hole that’s threatening to sink their company faster than its namesake did &lt;a href="http://www.theweek.com/article/index/94600/Did_ARod_hire_prostitutes_from_Spitzers_madam"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;’s reputation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy at the sales center in MGM said its only 60% sold just a few months shy of opening. If memory serves me (and I’ll check my email records to confirm) The Signature was well over 90% this close to game time. They’re still asking half a million or more for units, which the sales rep admirably managed to tell me without laughing. Good luck with that one guys. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the units sold are already in foreclosure. If the complex ever does get finished, which is not a foregone conclusion, unless something in the sales contract forbids it there will probably be units on the resale market competing against direct sale units three times as expensive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, seeing what’s happening to the town brings me great sadness. It’s hard for a human to feel more kinship for a city than I do with Las Vegas. In a lot of ways, she and I grew up together. While I don’t expect it to be the defining period of my life, my time as a professional poker player will probably go down in my memoirs as my formative years, and a big chunk of it was spent on The Strip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s looking like it will be recalled as her golden years as well. Residents a decade from now will talk about the days when easy credit and irrational exuberance brought tourists in faster than all the money in the world could be used to accommodate them. Buildings costing in the 9 figures (or more) sprung up faster than cacti after one of the two annual rainy days. There was an influx of job-seekers from the all around our country and the world probably unlike anything seen since the golden era of Detroit. Anyone with the manual dexterity needed to shuffle a deck was guaranteed a healthy middle class salary, executives were minted faster than poker chips, and the housing market exploded along with both. Even now, it’s hard to find anyone in Las Vegas who actually grew up there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the casinos cut staff, restaurants and clubs shutter, and buildings languish half-finished is sort of like seeing your college buddy get laid off, except at least you know your buddy will rebound eventually. Las Vegas probably won’t sink as far as Detroit, but it also probably won’t ever be what it was back when I was spending one week a month living out of the Bellagio. They can finish all of the condos named after reproductive organs, maybe even build the whole City Center project and a few more unnecessary casinos to boot, but they’ll never get back the optimism that was Las Vegas’s greatest natural resource for the last 50 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, much like the rest of the nation these days, though things seem to suck for everyone else they’re pretty damn good for those of us whose lives continue on unabated. I often feel guilty about just how much further my money goes now, or at least about enjoying it so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For less than half of what I used to pay at Bellagio, you can now rent a brand new suite, located just far enough from The Strip to avoid the annoyance of dopey tourists bouncing around aimlessly and stopping to look at every shiny object in a store window that they will never in their lives be able to afford, but still close enough to get there with a brief people mover-assisted walk. The cost of a rental car is more than recouped by the ability to buy food for breakfast and lunch at Whole Foods and bring it back to the kitchenette.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to get third-row tickets to “O”, a show I’ve wanted to see for over five years now but have previously never been able to due to my inability to plan anything more than three days in advance. This time three days was more than enough. The only other people in town were spring breakers, who couldn’t afford the ridiculous ticket prices (which would be unjustifiable for any show in the entire history of humanity but that one) and March Madness fans, who are too busy getting drunk on $2 Bud Lights at a sports book and rooting for their parlays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O” was, perhaps, the most fascinating thing I’ve ever seen, in fact, I’m still not sure it actually happened, let alone occurs twice nightly as billed. I think there’s just some hallucinogenic gas pumped into the theater, and then a guy with those swirly mesmerizing glasses comes on stage and tells you the story, because what I saw was simply an impossible sum of many only marginally-possible parts. It wasn’t even so much the acrobatics, which were impressive, but the logistics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a theater with a 25 foot deep pool holding 1.5 million gallons of water in the middle of the desert, the floor of which can be raised and lowered quickly, in sections, without causing a wake.  There’s a wall of air separating it climatically from the audience. There are various contraptions in the ceiling that people swing from, all of which can be moved in multiple dimensions, a cast of 85 world-class athletes (many of whom are Olympians) wearing costumes that cost as much as $10,000 and have to be replaced every two weeks. The show, if it really exists, and I’m skeptical (note the lack of videographic evidence) cost $100 million to get running, which is about the same as Terminator 2 but without any hope of selling DVDs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it all rationally, it just doesn’t add up. It’s not possible. But if it were possible, it would only be so in Las Vegas. Nowhere else could someone spend that kind of money on a theater with only 1,800 seats and one show, and have it end up one of the best gambles ever made. Walter Mathau once said about poker that it “exemplifies the worst aspects of capitalism that have made our country so great”. He was close, but Vegas, with its $11 billion casinos and shows that cost more than a skyscraper in most cities, beats it hands down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238137781165"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2678">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/518cc03cb07826cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="athvertising"/><category term="American Atheists"/><category term="Atheist Bus Campaign"/><category term="Ed Buckner"/><category term="New York"/><category term="New York City Atheists"/><title type="html">Atheist Bus Campaign arriving in NYC?</title><published>2009-03-27T07:08:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T07:08:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/atheist-bus-campaign-arriving-in-nyc/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight I attended a meeting of the New York City Atheists, who had a very special guest, Ed Buckner, the new president of American Atheists since Ellen Johnson “resigned” (?).

At the new neurologist's, we discovered that Charlie has grown almost 5 inches since September. In looking over photos from last summer, he still looks like a little boy---ok, certainly a &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt;---holding Jim's hand as they walked together on the beach. He's clearly been having quite a growth spurt and everyone (the neurologist included) has nodded, yes, this could have something to do with his struggles in the past few months. Generally Charlie is peaceful and attentive and trying very hard to learn and talk and loving walks in the city and subway rides and diner dinners and, of course, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;riding bikes&lt;/a&gt;. And then, seemingly suddenly, he goes from standing silently to crying out, banging, flailing, and we're right there, trying to hold on and keep him and everyone safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I've written about these things happening, people have been generous in offering suggestions for what to do. Rest assured that we've been working hard, especially with Charlie's teacher and her staff of aides and therapists, to address things with Charlie and to keep teaching him. Though there have been some very, very hard moments, Charlie has continued to learn---addition with decimals!---and to change. Certainly one thing he's had to adjust to is the rapid and continuous changes to his body. Often it seems he's simply baffled to find himself in a body so unexpectedly big and tall (the other day he realized he had only to reach up his arms to open the cabinets above the stove), and powerful. Charlie, I would warrant, is yet learning the extent of his strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I are quite aware of this and it's why we've been taking measures like seeing the new neurologist and taking a serious look at Charlie's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diagnosis_made_a_difference_but_drugs"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Charlie's teacher, we have been able to get a few home program hours from the school district: ABA has long been an effective teaching method for Charlie and we're back to drawing more on it to create structure and teach him to use a schedule at home. Sometimes it feels like we're back to the time around Charlie's diagnosis almost ten years ago in 1999, making the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;hard choices&lt;/a&gt; with a view to making things better for Charlie in the future, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I do realize, hey it could all go down in a few seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One outburst where things swing too hard and heftily and unnameable unnameables could occur. We've tried and we try to do "everything"; we love Charlie as he is, for who he is, because he's who he is, and Jim and I both seek to make this our message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudy Steuernagel publicly advocated about the good of her life with her son, Sky Walker, amid many, many struggles---Steuernagel died in January and her son is charged with killing her (he has pleaded "not guilty" through his lawyers). In yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/03/26/bauer_autism/print.html"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;, writer Ann Bauer describes how she too once wrote about autism as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"......beautiful, mysterious, perhaps even evolutionarily necessary. Denying that it can also be a wild, ravaging madness, a disease of the mind and soul. It was my trademark as an essayist, but also my profound belief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here she is writing about "the monster inside my son" who, now 21, has become violent, destructive, beating family members including Bauer herself and the residents of the group home where he was living. In January, while Bauer and her husband were at an inauguration party, Andrew spent ten hours "in an ambulance circling the Twin Cities, sedated and strapped down to a bed," after assaulting a woman in his group home. He finally ended up in a hospital and, when Bauer visits him, he said "'I might try to kill you.'" Andrew was treated with "buckets full of dangerous, doping drugs and two sessions of ECT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer has written previously about the changes in Andrew as he grew up, including &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autistic-catatonia/"&gt;catatonia&lt;/a&gt; following his being given a number of medications. I don't think I'm alone among parents of younger children to read her writings with a sense of necessity---to find out what awaits---mixed with fear. Will what happened to Andrew happen to my child, for all of our efforts? I want to say that it won't. And then I feel very human and think, you just never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether there's a connection between autism and violence: Bauer ends her essay considering this in light of the death of Trudy Steuernagel by &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;Sky Walker&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_prepared_criminal_justice_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;case of Henry Cozad&lt;/a&gt;, who is charged with the killing of a 59-year-old woman who lived with his father, lingers in the background. Writes Bauer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if [a link between autism and violence] exists, the cause is not clear. Our adult son's behavior could be the outcome of living daily in a world where everything hurts and nothing makes sense. It could be the result (as some scientists have postulated) of excess testosterone on the autistic brain. It could simply be wild coincidence that I ran across this particular story during a time when I was looking for answers. Any of these is possible. I just don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairman of Trudy Steuernagel's department rose at her memorial service to proclaim, "Autism doesn't equal violence." And this probably is mathematically correct: Autism does not always equal violence. But I do believe there may be a tragic, blameless relationship. Neither Sky nor Andrew means to be murderous -- of this I am sure -- but their circumstances, neurology, size and age combine to create the perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we have to be very careful at formulating too close a "link" between violence and autism. We need to be wary of even suggesting that there's a direct connection of the two, while not hesitating from talking about violence, aggression, and the like. And when we do talk and write about violence and autism, I'd propose that we be careful constantly to question why are we describing something violent----to what ends is violence being talked about? Yes, what Bauer writes about happening to her son is awful. Even though there are many more accounts of autism, of being on the autism spectrum and of families raising an autistic child that are much more tinged with hope than in previous years, it's possible that Bauer's account of violence and of every day life wrent by an autistic relative more closely parallels the "typical," "expected" account of life with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I've often wondered, what was &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;---the universe---thinking, that Charlie, with all of his needs and challenges, had to enter puberty early, fast, and thoroughly?  I keep thinking, we all needed just a little more time, to get ready----and then I'm reminded, well no. The time is now; as tough as it is to help Charlie at times, better to do it now while he's young and not yet the 6 feet tall he seems likely to grow into.  Better now,  because who knows what, yes, dark and light and dark with hidden light---dark shot through with warmth and light---the future holds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many people wanted to know how they could get involved and what’s the next step. &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1314"&gt;So now a league of 13 extraordinary skeptics, including Loxton, have assembled to address just that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those thirteen skeptics include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/meet_the_creators.html"&gt;Daniel Loxton&lt;/a&gt; (Junior Skeptic magazine); &lt;a href="http://www.radfordbooks.com/"&gt;Benjamin Radford&lt;/a&gt; (Skeptical Inquirer magazine); &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/about/speakers#scott"&gt;Dr. Eugenie Scott&lt;/a&gt; (National Center for Science Education); &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;Jeff Wagg&lt;/a&gt; (James Randi Educational Foundation); &lt;a href="http://www.djgrothe.com/Home.html"&gt;D.J. Grothe&lt;/a&gt; (Point of Inquiry podcast); &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/"&gt;Brian Dunning&lt;/a&gt; (Skeptoid podcast); &lt;a href="http://www.bad-language.com/aboutme"&gt;Dr. Karen Stollznow&lt;/a&gt; (The Skeptic magazine); &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/p_aboutus.htm"&gt;Robynn “Swoopy” McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; (Skepticality podcast); &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?page_id=80"&gt;Kylie Sturgess&lt;/a&gt; (Skeptic Zone podcast); &lt;a href="http://skeptools.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;Tim Farley&lt;/a&gt; (What’s the Harm? and Skeptools websites); &lt;a href="http://www.flockofdodos.com/"&gt;Dr. Randy Olson&lt;/a&gt; (Flock of Dodos documentary); &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/meet_the_creators.html"&gt;Pat Linse&lt;/a&gt; (Skeptic magazine); &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/bios.aspx?jaynovella"&gt;Jay Novella&lt;/a&gt; (The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe podcast)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those skeptics is Kylie Sturgess, one of my partners on Stop &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a pretty awesome collection of people (except for Randy Olson, whose 2 appearances on Skepticality convinced me he was a dick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope this inspires lots of others to get involved in skeptical activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on a similar note, Skeptologist Mark Edward makes some more suggestions regarding skeptical activism &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/03/26/next-steps-baiting-the-trap/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

One part of the songs they were considering for a choir concert at an elementary school had the following lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/met_in_god_we_still_trust.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/met_in_god_we_still_trust.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="185"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Can you believe some parents were offended by this? I know. Who would have thought, right? Anyway, 1 group of parents got the school to pull the plug on the song and is now suing the pants off the school board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “groundbreaking” new syllabus largely excludes the Bible and other religious texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious attitudes towards medical and sexual ethics, including areas such as same-sex relationships and cloning, will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of the British Humanist Association, the group behind the recent atheist bus advertisements, and the novels of Philip Pullman will be included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After already having a better health care system and slang, the damn limey’s have now officially surpassed us in their Religious Studies class too. Bollacks!&lt;/p&gt;

Wishing you could have a watch that could tell the future? &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=561"&gt;Well now you can&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the &lt;a href="http://borgeaudwatches.com/automatic.html"&gt;Swiss watchmaker Borgeaud.&lt;/a&gt; That’s right, if you’re easily fooled by preposterous nonsense, Borgeaud has the watch for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borgeaud has released a watch that will display a daily, 90 minute period known as the Raju Kaal (Rahukaalam, Rahu Kalam) that, according to Indian astrology, is considered an inauspicious period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study of Panchangas involves understanding Rasi phala, the impact of the signs of the zodiac on the individual. Astrologers consult the Panchangam to set auspicious dates for weddings, corporate mergers, and other worldly activities as per religion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all! The watch comes in 2 colors:  Gravitas Black and Gravitas Silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might expect to pay up to a buck to $2.50 for a piece of crap this idiotic. But act now and you can buy this limited edition and numbered garbage for the low, low price of $2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Thanks Borgeaud!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parental vaccine refusal endangers lives. Here we have a situation in which an unavoidable shortage of a vital vaccine, has combined with an irrational parental mistrust of expert scientific opinion to create a critical mass of vulnerable children. The result, so far, is four dead children. But in the absence of any shortage, vaccine myth and the poor parental decision making it breeds has already had a profound impact, with the potential for more to come. In the never-ending wake of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29502844.html"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have occurred in pockets of under-immunized children in areas of New York, San Diego, and Milwaukee.  Particularly in communities where parents know how to do their own “research” about vaccines. Many more children have suffered unnecessarily in the U.K. and elsewhere as a result of the spreading wave of panic over fictionalized vaccine dangers. In fact, as bad as this wave of vaccine parananoia is in the U.S., it’s &lt;a title="Vaccine fears in europe" href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/march-2009/a-dangerous-european-export"&gt;far worse in Europe and the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; where vaccine mythology is rampant, and the threat of vaccine preventable epidemics is very real. This widening circle of vaccine fear across the Atlantic is a major threat to children in this country.  Imported cases of vaccine-preventable disease can now find increasing populations of under-immunized children in which to take root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see children fall ill and die from completely preventable diseases because of irrational fear and a belief in myth should truly make us angry. Those of us who have the knowledge and experience to speak out publicly should do so. We should seek every opportunity at our disposal to speak with a clear and unintimidated voice to say that we’ve had enough. Enough of the armchair pseudoscience. Enough of the misinformed journalists. Enough of the celebrity grandstanding. That parents in this day and age would arrange a chicken pox or a measles party so that their children could actually get these diseases rather than have them safely vaccinated makes me want to scream. The hours I spend trying to correct the massive amounts of misinformation foisted on parents who believe a seemingly endless array of conjured myth is mind-numbing. We should be calling out the phoney mavericks, charlatans, and know-nothings for who they are. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;Robert Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=408"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt; believe they are fighting the noblist of fights. What they are doing, of course, is endangering lives. But more broadly, their rhetoric endangers the already fragile relationship society has with an evidence-based approach to understanding the world. It is our responsibility to make it known that the controversy is over. No, that there never was a controversy in the first place. That science and reason will not allow another child to die or suffer needlessly. Really, where is the outrage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole article is really worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

Now they’ve launched &lt;a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/103670"&gt;a fatwa against the cartoon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fox’s ‘Family Guy’ goes too far; file a complaint with the FCC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File an official complaint with the FCC against the FOX network and your local FOX affiliate station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 25, 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 8, Fox network aired Family Guy, a perverted and sickening program, into the homes of millions of Americans. This episode was rated TV-14 DLSV by FOX, meaning that in the network’s opinion it was appropriate for 14-year olds. It aired during prime-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this program was so explicit that I can’t even begin to describe it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFmYS5uZXQvZmFtaWx5Z3V5Lmh0bQ=="&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to watch these scenes or read our detailed review. WARNING: These scenes taken from the Fox program Family Guy are highly offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more offensive is Fox’s view of Christianity. At a “straight” meeting, the speaker talks to gays about Jesus and tells them, “He [Jesus] hates many people, but none more than homosexuals.&lt;br&gt;” Incidentally, Pepsico helped sponsor this program (&lt;a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vQm95Y290dFBlcHNpY28uY29t"&gt;BoycottPepsico.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really cannot get the full effect of the show’s portrayal of Christianity without watching the video or reading our review. You will hear the tone and sarcasm very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC has a duty to enforce the law and fine Fox for this sickening violation of broadcast decency standards. In addition, your local FOX network affiliate did not have to air this episode. Obviously, they do not care about your local community standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/afa-wants-you-to-watch-family-guy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/rlzYyfHcb9c/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/afa-wants-you-to-watch-family-guy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/QEjfrdudsJk/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be so horrible to be so insecure that your beliefs can be so threatened by cartoon show. Sucks to be them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:07 - The board is about to begin its debate on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:09 - Board member Ken Mercer of San Antonio moves to add “strengths and weaknesses” back into the science standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:12 - Mercer: This about allowing students to discuss and question strengths and weaknesses of all scientific theories. He claims receiving 15,0000-16,000 e-mails on this from around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:15 - Mercer goes down the “microevolution” vs. “macroevolution” path again. And he brings up “Piltdown man” and a list of other “weaknesses” he claims plague evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:19 - OK, it looks like board member David Bradley’s computer screen has TFN Insider up. Good morning, Mr. Bradley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:20 - Member Bob Craig of Lubbock offers a substitute amendment. “I am fully cognizant to the difference between faith and science. But I believe they can co-exist.” He argues that what the writing teams suggested in December still allows students to freely discuss all aspects of science. Mr. Craig proposes to keep the work group language (without “strengths and weaknesses”) but adds “including discussing what is not fully understood so as to encourage critical thinking by the student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:26 - Dallas member Geraldine “Tincy” Miller supports Mr. Craig’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:30 - This should be interesting. Mr. Mercer and other creationists have argued that taking “strengths and weaknesses” out of the standards will bar students from discussing and asking questions. Mr. Craig’s amendment addresses that, explicitly affirms the right of students to discuss and question while keeping phony “weaknesses” out of textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:32 - Mavis Knight speaks in favor of Mr. Craig’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:34 - The creationists have a difficult decision to make here. Is this about the freedom of students to ask questions, as they have argued, or is this about promoting phony attacks on evolution in textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:36 - Pat Hardy speaks in favor of Mr. Craig’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:37 - Terri Leo opposes Mr. Craig’s motion. She says the language is “too ambiguous.” She wants teachers to tell students specific “weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:38 - Lawrence Allen supports Mr. Craig’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:39 - By the way, Texas Freedom Network supports Mr. Craig’s motion (although we hadn’t seen it until now). It’s a wise and responsible way to ensure that students are free to ask questions. That’s how they learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:41 - Cynthia Dunbar opposes Mr. Craig’s motion. She notes a comment from Ms. Miller that she (Ms. Miller) is a committed Christian. Ms. Dunbar says that religious beliefs are irrelevant to what the board should so. Oh, really? Then why have her creationist colleagues and their allies questioned the faith of those who oppose putting “strengths and weaknesses” in the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:43 - Rick Agosto opposes Mr. Craig’s amendment. “If it’s not ‘fully understood,’ then I don’t consider that science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:44 - Once again, Mr. Craig has moved that the board retain the language proposed by writing teams in December (without “strengths and weaknesses”) but add to the expectation that students analyze and evaluate scientific explanations: “including discussing what is not fully understood so as to encourage critical thinking by the student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:46 - Barbara Cargill opposes Mr. Craig’s motion. She says “strengths and weaknesses” language protects the ability of teachers to tell students “weaknesses” of evolution (however phony those “weaknesses” are, apparently). “Darwinists have tried to smother all the challenges … (and) weaknesses of evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:52 - Mr. Mercer opposes Mr. Craig’s motion. “What are they afraid of? Why all this national attention over one word, ‘weaknesses’?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:54 - McLeroy calls a 10-minute recess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:08 - They’re back. Ms. Knight moves to change Mr. Craig’s amendment to read: “fully understand IN ALL FIELD OF SCIENCE.” So the wording would be: “including discussing what is not fully understood in all fields of science.” The board accepts that change without objection. We’re back to Mr. Craig’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:12 - Mr. Craig’s motion fails 6-8. We’re back to Mr. Mercer’s original amendment adding back “strengths and weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:13 - Mr. Mercer’s motion fails 7-7!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11;15 - This is huge victory for sound science education in Texas. Moreover, the creationists’ opposition to Mr. Craig’s motion exposed their hypocrisy about wanting to ensure that students can ask questions about science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, good triumphs over evil! Way to go, guys.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I have many ideas but most just come and go. This time, however, the idea sort of stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to somehow alert the general public here in Australia about some of our concerns as skeptics. The normal press release is all very good but with hundreds of companies and organizations issuing press releases everyday, ours can get lost in the wash. So, what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not write a letter to the very people and/or institutions with which we have a concern? Again, would that mean anything really, would they care? Okay, one more step. Aim the message not so much at them, but at the general public. An open letter was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238130075279"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_108th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88ded39bdfb4a4f6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">The 108th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle</title><published>2009-03-27T05:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T05:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/_UeWx87q3JU/the_108th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_108th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, there's something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly four years, I don't recall having seen a &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; meeting quite like this one before. The &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1315"&gt;108th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle has landed at Podblack Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a doozy. In fact, it's a video podcast. Be sure to go and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net"&gt;The Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt; on April 9. Start getting your skeptical wheels spinning and get more of that great skeptical blogging ready in time to make another great Skeptics' Circle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_108th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_UeWx87q3JU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238129157362"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10614446.post-2656564016495379534">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae3a39363a5571db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The 108th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle</title><published>2009-03-27T03:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T03:58:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2009/03/108th-meeting-of-skeptics-circle.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Orac)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Circular Reasoning</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238128349857"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/26/meteorites-from-the-asteroid-over-sudan/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3968c7549c7c6444</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Meteorites from the asteroid over Sudan</title><published>2009-03-27T04:19:16Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T04:19:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/26/meteorites-from-the-asteroid-over-sudan/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Creationists and other twinkies prevented me from writing about the fact that meteorites were recovered from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/06/incoming-2/"&gt;the small asteroid that blew up over the Sudan in October&lt;/a&gt;.

We're not trying to change their minds," said Terry McDonald with Metroplex Atheists.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the weekly gathering of the Metroplex Atheists, the talk was about Monday's unveiling of two billboards with the message, "Don't believe in God? You are not alone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's to let those people who don't believe know that they're not alone and that there are a lot of groups that they can become involved in," said McDonald.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The billboards will stand along I-35 near Loop 12 in Northwest Dallas and I-35 at Braswell in North Fort Worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message encourages atheists and other non-believers to log onto www.dfwcor.org. The C.O.R stands for "Coalition of Reason." The website will be up and running Monday to coincide with the unveiling of both billboards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Darrell Bock of the Dallas Theological Seminary welcomes the debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They (non-believers) represent a significant minority in our culture. They're becoming more verbal and the thing to do is to have a conversation with them about that," he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Bock says the billboards may enrage some Christians at first, but he doesn't expect that anger to last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"People pretty much have their minds made up on these kinds of matters. They're either going to be for or against," he said. "A lot of people will drive by and it will be the topic of conversation for a few days perhaps, but I don't think it's going to change very much."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Identical billboards are already up in Philadelphia and Denver. Non-believers have been gathering momentum as of late. HBO comic Bill Maher questioned God's existence in his 2008 documentary, "Religulous."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recent study found that more than 15 percent of Americans no longer affiliate with a religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://cbs11tv.com/video/?id=40342@ktvt.dayport.com"&gt;Video &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-3071623474147705648?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Now in addition to spring peepers and chorus frogs, we have wood frogs.&lt;img style="float:right" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1355/1209021753_eb1551d76c_m.jpg" alt="wood frog" width="240" height="160"&gt; Wood frogs always crack me up, since they &lt;a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/alan_wolf/rana_sylvatica_chorus.aiff/view.html"&gt;sound sort of like they are cussing&lt;/a&gt; (Click to listen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nifty fact about wood frogs: they can &lt;a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs/woodfrog/index.html"&gt;tolerate being frozen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As the temperature drops below freezing each winter, the wood frog drifts into a deep hibernation, its breathing and heartbeat grind to a halt, and as much as 65% of the water in its body gradually crystallizes into ice.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click around on that site, you can find additional nifty info, like &lt;a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs/woodfrog/woodfrog_4.html"&gt;MRI images&lt;/a&gt; of a frog actually in the process of freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we know what the males are &lt;a title="more cranky frog sounds" href="http://av.aqua.wisc.edu/jason/audio/woodfrog.mp3"&gt;cussing&lt;/a&gt; about now!&lt;/p&gt;

to the outgoing Drug Czar's deep concerns about research with illegal drugs conducted with subjects who are addicted to those drugs, those concerns &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/local/Examiner-Special-Report--Federal-programs-gave-addicts-street-drugs-41846907.html"&gt;reported in an article in the &lt;i&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  From that article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The federal government is giving crack and powder cocaine, morphine, and other hard-core drugs to taxpayer-funded researchers for testing on addicts, &lt;i&gt;The Examiner&lt;/i&gt; has learned.

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the government has authorized, funded and lobbied for studies in which otherwise illegal drugs were given to addicts in cities such as Washington, Bethesda, Baltimore, New York, Minneapolis and San Antonio. The studies continue today and have an array of aims, from documenting the ways cocaine warps the brain to the intensity of pain from morphine withdrawal. ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Walters, drug czar during both terms of George W. Bush's administration, said he learned about the studies near the end of Bush's term. "It's not only questionable ethically, but probably -- given the science -- it may not be able to be defended at all," Walters told &lt;i&gt;The Examiner&lt;/i&gt; recently. ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most people see the things that people will do to themselves when they're addicted -- what they'll do to themselves, to their families, to their loved ones," Walters told &lt;i&gt;The Examiner&lt;/i&gt;. "I think that when you bring someone in and say, 'Well, they're not seeking treatment yet and therefore it's OK to use them as an experimental subject' -- that's not the understanding that the current science gives us about this disease." ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The question is whether the results justify using these individuals as disposable subjects," Walters said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walters seems to be saying that the use of people who are addicted to drug in research on those drugs cannot be ethical under any circumstances.  (His claim that "it may not be able to be defended at all" at least strongly suggests that this is his position.)  Is he right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/is_drug_research_on_humans_who.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/is_drug_research_on_humans_who.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/DugzRaEZ98U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238117878446"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4211">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07f949a1d86649b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="freshwater" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Freshwater"/><category term="burn" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="burn"/><category term="cross" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="cross"/><category term="photo" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="photo"/><title type="html">Freshwater Day 16: Whose Arm?</title><published>2009-03-27T01:10:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-27T01:15:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/freshwater-day-11.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no extended report tonight.  I have other commitments.  I’ll post full reports of today’s and tomorrow’s testimony sometime over the weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one major claim was made in testimony today.  Ben Nielson, a classmate of Zachary Dennis, testified that the arm he saw in a newspaper picture which was identified as Zachary’s arm showing the injury, was not Zachary’s arm.  Nielson testified that he saw a mark on Zachary’s arm shortly after the incident in December 2007, and the mark was significantly smaller than that in the picture and was on the inside of the arm rather than on the outside as the picture apparently shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben testified that when he saw the photograph in the newspaper, he exclaimed “That’s not Zach’s arm.”  His father corroborated the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Ben nor his father Mark, who also testified briefly, could remember when they saw the newspaper picture or which newspaper it was in.  Zachary Dennis’ identity was not made public until October 4, 2008, on the first day of Freshwater’s termination hearing, while photographs of Zach’s arm were published considerably earlier without identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If anyone in the comments can identify the date of the earliest news photo of Zachary’s arm, specifically identified as Zachary Dennis’ arm,  in the Mount Vernon News or Columbus Dispatch I’d appreciate it.)

&lt;p&gt;Cup of robots anybody?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Autonomous mobile Robot as a Remedial tool for Autistic children Project. &lt;a href="http://www.aurora-project.com/"&gt;The AuRoRA Project&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;studies if and how robots can become a "toy" that might serve an educational or therapeutic role for children with autism. Our main aim is to engage children with autism in coordinated and synchronized interactions with the environment thus helping them to develop and increase their communication and social interaction skills. Important social skills that we aim to facilitate are turn-taking and imitation, in addition to general communication and interaction skills that are required in human-human contact. Humans are the best models for human social behaviour, but their social behaviour is very subtle, elaborate, and widely unpredictable. Many children with autism are however interested to play with mechanical toys or computers. Our project aims at children who have less developed communication and interaction skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AuRoRA robots have been designed to teach autistic children social interaction skills, turn-taking, and imitation games. They also act as mediators and encourage interaction with humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, what I am seeing here is interesting, but it boils down to a project that wants to help autistic children, but does not truly understand autism and its unique expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AuRoRA Project provides an information page about autism. Have a look at this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child seems to be 'cut-off' from the world and as an observer, avoiding social contact and viewing other individuals as providers or observers, without seeming to require social interaction and not knowing how to initiate or partake in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this type of commentary perpetuates autism myths. Understanding autism requires a different approach as opposed to taking in only what the eyes see. There are several autistic adults heavily blogging in order to speak out against such assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Amanda Baggs's blogs titled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=431"&gt;Shrinking us down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=434"&gt;Yep we do have nonverbal communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=414"&gt;Dialects of nonverbal language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?page_id=143"&gt;Autistic Aug Comm Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also noticed on the AuRoRA autism info page, a reference stating that autistic people lack imagination--another myth that needs to be conquered. Hold on there a second. I suppose I should be liberal and state that autistic lack of imagination *may* be a myth. Let it be known, however, that I would die for a one-in-a-million scholarship to work with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; on the next robot fantasy movie--and especially so if it heavily entailed the use of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, the robots used in AuRoRA seem awesome! I especially like the Peekee robot provided by &lt;a href="http://www.wanyrobotics.com/store/"&gt;Wany Robotics&lt;/a&gt; in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Board of Education creationist Barbara Cargill today &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/live-blogging-the-texas-science-debate-iv/"&gt;proposed an amendment&lt;/a&gt; to the science standards saying that teachers have to tell their students there are different estimates for the age of the Universe. This is not even a veiled attempt to attack the Big Bang model of the Universe, which clearly, and through multiple lines of evidence, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/05/the-universe-is-1373-12-billion-years-old/"&gt;indicates the Universe is 13.7 +/- 0.12 billion years old&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ms. Cargill is right, if she means that &amp;quot;different estimates&amp;quot; range from 13.58 to 13.82 (given one standard deviation) billion years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she doesn’t mean that at all, does she? &lt;a href="http://www.barbaracargill.com/"&gt;If you read her website&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see she’s an out-and-out creationist. She has a large number of, um, &lt;em&gt;factual errors&lt;/em&gt; on her site that are clearly right out of the Creationist Obscurational Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, her antiscience amendment passed 11 - 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow that will go to the final vote on whether it will be added to the standards or not. With such a majority voting to pass it along, it looks like it will pass, and Texas students will get their chance to learn that the Universe is 6000 years old, and when they try to get a job or do anything later in life, they will be routinely laughed at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s great, Texas! Keep on keepin’ on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I rescind my earlier post, and tentatively (until the final vote tomorrow) submit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Apparently the moderators didn't rate my answer, because it's gone now. Good thing I &lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/assets_c/2009/03/carQ-8441.php"&gt;saved it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for posterity. Text reads:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There's a good chance my car might get towed at any time. So, what are my options for tracking my car's movement (possible via GPS) when it's not turned on and I'm not in it? &lt;p&gt;This is probably not possible, but I'd like to be able to tell if my car is being towed. Since it'll most likely be towed in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping a few blocks away from my dubiously legal parking spot, I live in fear of waking up in the morning to find that it's gone. Is there any alarm that can remotely alert me if my car travels?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My preferred solution would be:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Park car, turn car off. Put device in car.&lt;br&gt;
Leave car.&lt;br&gt;
If car then moves, device alerts another device that I keep with me, causing some kind of an alarm. Yeah, my car will still have been towed, but at least I can intervene and pick it up at the towing lot and not be late for work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anything I can make work for this purpose? &lt;br&gt;

This new methodology can initially seem compelling, but if the conclusion is at odds with other more standard ways of looking at the same question, further investigation can often reveal some hidden dependencies or non-robustness. And so it is with the new graph &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/03/with-all-due-respect/#comment-115845"&gt;being cited&lt;/a&gt; purporting to show that the models are an "abject" failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure in question was first revealed in Michaels' recent &lt;a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090212/testimony_michaels.pdf"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; to Congress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/michaels_fig3.jpg" title="Click to enlarge"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/michaels_fig3.jpg" width="90%/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you calculate the trends in the observations to 2008 starting in 2003, 2002, 2001…. etc, and compare that to the model projections for the same period. Nothing wrong with this in principle. However, while it initially looks like each of the points is bolstering the case that the real world seems to be tracking the lower edge of the model curve, these points are not all independent. For short trends, there is significant impact from the end points, and since each trend ends on the same point (2008), an outlier there can skew all the points significantly. An obvious question then is how does this picture change year by year? or if you use a different data set for the temperatures? or what might it look like in a year&amp;#39;s time? Fortunately, this is not rocket science, and so the answers can be swiftly revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, this is what you would have got if you'd done this last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/michaels07.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which might explain why it never came up before. I've plotted both the envelope of all the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/what-the-ipcc-models-really-say/"&gt;model runs&lt;/a&gt; I'm using and 2 standard deviations from the mean. Michaels appears to be using a slightly &lt;a href="http://rankexploits.com/musings/2009/michaels-testimony-do-the-graphs-look-right/#comment-10463"&gt;different methodology&lt;/a&gt; that involves grouping the runs from a single model together before calculating the 95% bounds. Depending on the details that might or might not be appropriate - for instance, averaging the runs and calculating the trends from the ensemble means would incorrectly reduce the size of the envelope, but weighting the contribution of each run to the mean and variance by the number of model runs might be ok.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even using the latest data (up to the end of 2008), the impression one gets depends very much on the dataset you are using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/michaels08.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting perhaps is what it will likely look like next year once 2009 has run its course. I made two different assumptions - that this year will be the same as last year (2008), or that it will be the same as 2007. These two assumptions bracket the result you get if you simply assume that 2009 will equal the mean of the previous 10 years. Which of these assumptions is most reasonable remains to be seen, but the first few months of 2009 are running significantly warmer than 2008. Nonetheless, it's easy to see how sensitive the impression being given is to the last point and the dataset used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/michaels09.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus unlikely this new graph would have seen the light of day had it come up in 2007; and given that next year will likely be warmer than last year, it is not likely to come up again; and since the impression of 'failure' relies on you using the HadCRUT3v data, we probably won't be seeing too many sensitivity studies either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, initially compelling pictures whose character depends on a single year's worth of data and only if you use a very specific dataset are unlikely to be robust or provide much guidance for future projections. Instead, this methodology tells us a) that 2008 was relatively cool compared to recent years and b) short term trends don't tell you very much about longer term ones. Both things we &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/12/2008-temperature-summaries-and-spin/"&gt;knew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/01/uncertainty-noise-and-the-art-of-model-data-comparison/"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Bill_in_Texas_would_allow_creationists_0321.html" rel="external "&gt;press report&lt;/a&gt;, the not-so-hidden agenda behind the bill is to certify graduates of the Institute for Creation Research Graduate School to apply for jobs as teachers in the Texas public school system.  The ICR is a young-earth-creationist organization that purports to offer a graduate degree in science education with minors in general science, astro/geophysics, biology, and geology. (Steve Schafersman of Texas Citizens for Science argued a year ago that they should be &lt;a href="http://www.texscience.org/documents/thecb-april2008-testimony.htm" rel="external "&gt;certified to offer a masters in theology&lt;/a&gt;, but not in science.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICR 2 years ago moved its headquarters to Texas, where its programs are not accredited. They had been accredited in California by an accrediting agency for Christian schools, one of the founders of which was also a founder of ICR. That accrediting agency, however, is not recognized in Texas. For details, see an &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/rncse/28/2/setback-icr-texas" rel="external "&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Glenn Branch in the Reports of the National Center for Science Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest I appear to pussyfoot, let me state that the upshot is that the bill, if passed, would allow wholly unqualified graduates of a diploma mill to teach science in the public school system in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

Assistance with figuring out what to do directly after a child receives an autism spectrum diagnosis---more understanding about autism among first responders like policemen and firemen---more housing for adults on the spectrum: Yesterday, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez re-introduced the Helping HANDS with Autism Act, which addresses these three needs. A similar bill was introduced last year, the &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/politics/Menendez_bill_will_aid_people_with_autism_and_families.html"&gt;Bergen Record&lt;/a&gt; notes. Senator Menendez is now "more optimistic the measure could be included in a broader health care reform measure Congress is drafting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There've been a number of autism bills introduced in state legislatures throughout the US; y can read about them in a &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/autism.htm"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; of autism legislation via the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/autism.htm"&gt;National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt; site. Many of the bills include calls for insurance companies to cover &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/insurance_and_autism_not_just_for_aba"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt;, usually in the form of ABA. I think it's important the proposed NJ legislation is specifically about services, training, and education, and that it addresses the needs of both young children and their families and of adults. At this point in taking care of Charlie---he'll be 12 in May---we don't feel so much that we need an "autism navigator" to figure out what services Charlie needs and how to access them. (Which is not to say, we don't often feel quite uncertain about what to do next!) Autism is lifelong and one of the (many) pressing concerns for individuals with autism in NJ (and elsewhere....) is housing: Over 8000 developmentally disabled adults in NJ have been &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/sued-new-jerseys-department-of-human-services/"&gt;on a waiting list for housing&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade and I suspect that list is growing, and very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/helping-hands-for-autism-act/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to read the original text of the Helping HANDS for Autism Act.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN PREPARATION FOR AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH, MENENDEZ REINTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT FAMILIES DEALING WITH AUTISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;At 1 in 94 children, New Jersey has highest incidence of autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON – With Autism Awareness Month beginning next week, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) today reintroduced his legislation that would support families dealing with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The Helping HANDS for Autism Act, which is hailed by autism advocacy organizations, is a three-part legislative package that includes a program to guide families seeking services and care, increased awareness among first responders and housing for adults with ASD. At 1 in 94 children diagnosed with ASD, New Jersey has the highest rate in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a family that has been touched by autism seeks support or guidance, it should be readily available,” said Menendez. “This legislation is meant to strengthen the Autism Spectrum Disorder support structure, which can make a real difference in the lives of autistic citizens and their families. I will work to make sure that this issue and these proposals are in the mix as we tackle health care reform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is more important to families touched by autism than timely access to the information and services they need to meet their daily challenges,” said Leslie Long, Director of Public Policy for &lt;a href="http://www.njcosac.org/cosac2/Home%20Page"&gt;Autism New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. “This legislation directly responds to the needs of the autism community and will make a tangible difference in people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each of the three titles included in this legislation offers an important opportunity to address an area of concern for families affected by Autism,” said Elizabeth Emken, Vice President of Government Relations for &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;. “Autism Speaks thanks Senator Menendez for his leadership in helping families face the challenges associated with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Senator Menendez has taken the time to listen to the concerns of individuals with Autism and their families and the need to offer those affected by this lifelong challenge a helping hand in attaining the support, resources and opportunities to live as independently as possible in the community,” said Linda Walder Fiddle, Executive Director of &lt;a href="http://www.djfiddlefoundation.org/"&gt;The Daniel Jordan Fiddle Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “The Daniel Jordan Fiddle Foundation fully endorses the Helping Hands for Autism Act, and looks forward to working with Senator Menendez to assure the fulfillment of its goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The National Autism Center recognizes the importance of the Helping HANDS for Autism Act and its potential positive impact on families,” said Dr. Susan M. Wilczynski, Executive Director of the &lt;a href="http://www.nationalautismcenter.org/"&gt;National Autism Center&lt;/a&gt;. “This comprehensive autism legislation encourages enhanced access to autism services, a more prepared community of first responders, and increased independence through housing opportunities for adults -- all vital to the health and well being of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background of legislation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping HANDS for Autism Act of 2009&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sponsored by Senator Robert Menendez&lt;br&gt;
An Act to Increase Housing, Awareness, and Navigation Demonstration Services (HANDS) for Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title I: Autism Navigator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Helping HANDS for Autism Act creates a grant program to provide autism navigator services to help families of individuals with autism spectrum disorders ‘navigate’ the complex, fragmented, and often confusing web of services and care that they need.  Navigators will help guide families to current health, education, housing and social services that are often available to individuals in the autism spectrum.  Too often families feel overwhelmed after diagnosis and often lost as to where to turn for help.  For example, this program will help connect families to important treatment options soon after diagnosis, help families identify education options, help coordinate individuals’ care and community support.  This program would provide a trained, knowledgeable hand to help families from the moment of diagnosis throughout their child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title II: Autism Awarenes&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;br&gt;
This bill provides for the development, demonstration and dissemination of a standard curriculum for the training of first responders (police, fire departments, emergency medical technicians and other volunteers) in assisting individuals with autism and other cognitive behavioral disabilities.  It provides grants to states and local government to support training of first responders.  People with developmental disabilities, including autism, have up to seven times more contact with law enforcement officers than others, according to an article in the F.B.I. Law Enforcement Bulletin in April 2001.  That is why training is so important.  Something as simple as first responders turning off flashing lights and sirens on a police car could make the difference between a peaceful or chaotic encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title III: Home of Their Own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This bill creates a HUD task force comprised of appropriate national and state autism advocacy groups, community-based organizations and parents who are charged with developing a housing demonstration grant program for adults with autism.  The goal of the grant program is to provide individualized housing and services to adults with autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative proposal to include the language “including discussing what is not fully understood so as to encourage critical thinking by the student” was also rejected 7-7.  The rejection of this alternative is noteworthy because the creationists on the board and the current culture war strategy of the Discovery Institute have argued that students should learn “more” about evolution to develop critical thinking skills.  The alternative language fit directly in that rationalization, but in a scientifically rigorous way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was the problem.  During the debate over the alternative several creationist board members directly opposed it because it did not include teaching “weaknesses” to the students, which they have now confirmed is a code word for the lies creationists invent about science and the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is not over.  There are still more proposals being floated and voted on, many of them still anti-science and anti-education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Update:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success was short-lived.  Several amendments that encourage bad teachers to include pseudo-science and lies in the classroom made it into the final standards.  See the comments for links.

Although vaccine myth is of particular interest to me, I promise that my posts wont &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; be vaccine related. There is, unfortunately, much to discuss. In fact I had a difficult time deciding which vaccine-related issue to write about for my inaugural post. In the end I came up with more of an opinion piece, but it’s an issue worth airing. Things in anti-vaccine land may be reaching a dangerous turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="1" align="middle" width="192" src="http://www.vaccineinformation.org/photos/hib_aap006.jpg" height="170"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very recent past, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was what could truly be called a scourge to humanity. As recently as 1987, this particularly nasty bacterium caused invasive disease in a startling 1 of every 200 children in the U.S. under 5 years of age. Approximately two-thirds of these children developed meningitis, with a mortality rate of about 5%. Up to 30% of the survivors suffered permanent brain damage. Those children lucky enough to avoid meningitis developed pneumonia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, epiglottitis, or generalized sepsis. Fortunately I have never seen or treated a child with invasive disease due to Hib. That’s because I began my pediatric  training in 1991 when vaccination against these horrendous diseases was just beginning. What was once a common and devastating menace to children, the dreaded nightmare of every pediatrician, was quickly brought to it’s knees. By 2006, the incidence of invasive Hib disease had been cut by 99%. Within a short period of time, the very nature of pediatric medicine seemed changed forever. That’s why I was so saddened to read the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5803a4.htm?s_cid=mm5803a4_e"&gt;Hib surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; from Minnesota released by the CDC in January. In 2008 five children in that state (ranging from 5 months to 3 years of age) developed invasive disease due to Hib. That is the largest recorded number since 1992, just after the vaccine was licensed. Three of those children had meningitis, one had epiglottitis, and another had pneumonia. One child, a 7 month old with meningitis, died. Of those five children, 3 had received none of the recommended doses of Hib vaccine due to parental refusal. The other 2 were too young to have completed the series, and one of these had an immunodeficiency that likely made the vaccine ineffective. At first these five cases from Minnesota seemed like an isolated fluke. Then came the news, just released by the &lt;a href="http://www.dsf.health.state.pa.us/health/cwp/view.asp?A=171&amp;amp;Q=252640"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, of seven more cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease since October. All were children under 5, and all were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. Three of these seven children have been confirmed to have died. And now &lt;a href="http://www.bangordailynews.com/detail/101193.html"&gt;news of a 3 year old in Maine&lt;/a&gt; who is recovering from Hib meningitis. There hasn’t been a confirmed case of Hib meningitis in Maine since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious and infuriating factor contributing to these small but concerning outbreaks is the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of parents refusing vaccinations for their children, or altering the vaccine schedule out of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;misguided concerns&lt;/a&gt;;  either about the dangers of “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;too many too soon&lt;/a&gt;“, or the cumulative exposure to &lt;a href="http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=88655"&gt;vaccine constituants&lt;/a&gt;. This delay in vaccination, &lt;font color="#000000"&gt;à&lt;/font&gt; la Dr. Sears, has created an increasing population of children with gaps in their vaccination coverage, and who are therefore vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease. I may write more on Dr. Sears in a future post. For now, suffice it to say that more parents can probably quote Dr. Sears’ irresponsible and scientifically unfounded vaccine schedule than can name 3 reliable sources of vaccine information. My fear is that these terrifying outbreaks of Hib disease may be the canaries in the coal mine, signifying more trouble to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increase in parental vaccine refusal, a second factor may also have played a role in this upswing of Hib disease. And this second factor has a particular irony to it. Since December of 2007, there has been a nationwide shortage of Hib vaccine. Merck, one of only two vaccine manufacturers producing Hib vaccine in the U.S. (Sanofi is the other), was forced to close it’s Hib manufacturing facility due to bacterial contamination detected at the plant on a routine FDA inspection. No actual contamination of vaccine ever occurred. However, the company recalled 12 lots of vaccine and was forced to close and retool it’s facility. While the anti-vaccine crowd has predictably spun this as an example of the dangers of our vaccine supply, it is actually a perfect example of how stringent and effective the vaccine safety system really is. The Hib vaccine shortage that resulted from this plant closure led the CDC to issue interim vaccination recommendations. It recommended that doctors continue to administer the primary series of Hib vaccines (at 2, 4, and 6 months of age), but to delay the booster dose, typically given between 12 and 15 months of age, until further notice. While Sanofi (the sole remaining producer of Hib vaccine) has purportedly had enough vaccine to meet this goal, pediatricians (this one included) have often found their supplies running low, and themselves unable to complete the primary series at the appropriate intervals. This shortage, coupled with faltering parental confidence in the safety of vaccines, has created a dangerous situation. And sometimes a strange one. On one recent day I had a mother call frantically to make sure her child would get the Hib vaccine on time, while on the next day a parent called to ask about spacing out her child’s vaccine schedule to make it safer for his immune system. Which brings me to the title of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parental vaccine refusal endangers lives. Here we have a situation in which an unavoidable shortage of a vital vaccine, has combined with an irrational parental mistrust of expert scientific opinion to create a critical mass of vulnerable children. The result, so far, is four dead children. But in the absence of any shortage, vaccine myth and the poor parental decision making it breeds has already had a profound impact, with the potential for more to come. In the never-ending wake of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29502844.html"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have occurred in pockets of under-immunized children in areas of New York, San Diego, and Milwaukee.  Particularly in communities where parents know how to do their own “research” about vaccines. Many more children have suffered unnecessarily in the U.K. and elsewhere as a result of the spreading wave of panic over fictionalized vaccine dangers. In fact, as bad as this wave of vaccine parananoia is in the U.S., it’s &lt;a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/march-2009/a-dangerous-european-export" title="Vaccine fears in europe"&gt;far worse in Europe and the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; where vaccine mythology is rampant, and the threat of vaccine preventable epidemics is very real. This widening circle of vaccine fear across the Atlantic is a major threat to children in this country.  Imported cases of vaccine-preventable disease can now find increasing populations of under-immunized children in which to take root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see children fall ill and die from completely preventable diseases because of irrational fear and a belief in myth should truly make us angry. Those of us who have the knowledge and experience to speak out publicly should do so. We should seek every opportunity at our disposal to speak with a clear and unintimidated voice to say that we’ve had enough. Enough of the armchair pseudoscience. Enough of the misinformed journalists. Enough of the celebrity grandstanding. That parents in this day and age would arrange a chicken pox or a measles party so that their children could actually get these diseases rather than have them safely vaccinated makes me want to scream. The hours I spend trying to correct the massive amounts of misinformation foisted on parents who believe a seemingly endless array of conjured myth is mind-numbing. We should be calling out the phoney mavericks, charlatans, and know-nothings for who they are. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;Robert Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=408"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt; believe they are fighting the noblist of fights. What they are doing, of course, is endangering lives. But more broadly, their rhetoric endangers the already fragile relationship society has with an evidence-based approach to understanding the world. It is our responsibility to make it known that the controversy is over. No, that there never was a controversy in the first place. That science and reason will not allow another child to die or suffer needlessly. Really, where is the outrage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old bud Dan Vergano wrote a great article in USA Today, um, today, &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-03-25-hollywood-science_N.htm"&gt;about how scientists are portrayed in the movies&lt;/a&gt;. He talked to a lot of people who make movies, and others who do science, and… me. Hey, cool! I’m in an article with Ron Howard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in there is Jennifer Ouellette — blogger, author, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/448-the-amazing-meeting-7-speakers.html"&gt;TAM 7 speaker&lt;/a&gt;, and person in charge of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/"&gt;The Science and Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and fellow Hive Overmind blogger (and Jennifer’s hubby) &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/"&gt;Sean Carroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is entertaining, and does a good job of talking about how scientists are seen in flicks, how that image has changed (imagine the coldly logical scientists from the original version of &lt;em&gt;The Thing from Another World&lt;/em&gt;, for example, or Bernard Quatermass from the 1950s/60s British serials, compared to scientists in recent movies who have families and lives), and why producers care more about that now than they used to. I’m glad to hear it. I think movies have a powerful influence on how we see both science and scientists. I’m glad Hollywood understands that and wants to take care of that legacy, too, and I know that with Jennifer at the helm the SEE will help that happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238095773375"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6437">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8fc19714ba29b7e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fred shapiro"/><category term="government"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Quotes Uncovered: Who Wanted the Least Government?</title><published>2009-03-26T18:56:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T18:56:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/ozyE_jPkBck/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/quotes-uncovered-who-wanted-the-least-government/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Quotes Uncovered

Boston: Beacon Press&lt;br&gt;
2008&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it like to be a woman scientist?  In a society where being a woman is somehow a distinct experience from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/11/women_scientists_and_ordinary.php"&gt;being an ordinary human being&lt;/a&gt;, the answer to this question can be complicated.  And, in a time and place where being a scientist, being a professional -- indeed, even being American -- was still being worked out, the complexities of the answer can add up to a biography of that time, that place, that swirl of intellectual and cultural ferment, as well as of that woman scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astronomer Maria Mitchell was not only a pioneering woman scientist in the early history of the United States, but she was one of the nation's first professional scientists.  Renée Bergland's biography of Mitchell illuminates a confluence of circumstances that made it possible for Mitchell to make her scientific contributions -- to be a scientist at all.  At the same time, it tracks a retrograde cultural swing of which Mitchell herself was aware: a loss, during Mitchell's lifetime, of educational and career opportunities for women in the sciences.&lt;br&gt;

It's a pretty stupid and common ad hominem attack in which the attacker, virtually always an advocate of "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) tries to smear those of us who argue against pseudoscience and for science-based medicine as being hopelessly in the pocket of big pharma to the point where we make the statements we do because we're "shills" for the drug companies. Personally, although I did receive a couple of payments back in the mid-1990s for an invention my thesis advisor and I came up with, nothing ever came of it. Consequently, since then I've been so utterly free from pharma filthy lucre that when I have to state my disclosures at talks I frequently joke that I have no disclosures because no drug company finds my research sufficiently interesting or potentially profitable to bother with it. Not that that stops the woo-friendly trolls who sometimes come through here shouting "pharma shill"!&lt;/p&gt;

Highlighting and nurturing individual autistic interests are key to fostering self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find little gratification, let alone meaning in life, when I am cut off from doing what drives me. Success goes right out the window when I am forced to do things I am incompatible with. Of course the checkbook needs to be balanced--okay I lied because truthfully I am not in charge of balancing my checkbook, but it's a good example--the house cleaned, as well as mundane errands appeased, but those are temporary distractions. Being forced to live life against my nature is a recipe for disaster, as prolonged adversity equals nothing but the dreaded meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I took my then three-year old autistic son, Moxie, to a classmate get-together at a local park. I was not looking forward to going, yet I didn't want to impose my preferences on Moxie, who actually ended up having a fabulous time. I was overwhelmed by the darting yelping children from the moment I arrived at the park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes into the play date, I chanced an escape to the safety of a nearby lone bench. Moxie was happily engrossed in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_play"&gt;parallel play&lt;/a&gt; at a sprinkling water feature. I smiled to myself knowing that it would be a long while before Moxie would bombard me with a demand of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let my mind wander while casually observing the other parents. My attention focused on a little autistic boy named Sam who happens to love the alphabet. Sam regularly incorporates letters into his life in the same way that I regularly incorporate several moments of quiet time into mine. Sam lives for letters. I live for stolen quiet tranquil moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam amused himself by writing letters all over the surrounding sidewalk. His nervous mother stood by consumed with Sam's lack of interaction at this ever-important preschool get-together. She playfully ruffled his hair and gently grabbed his arms, attempting to steer and coax him toward interaction with a small group of chattering mini-social-butterfly peers. Sam resented his mother's intrusions and let her know by running away, shrieking, and wildly flapping his hands. Soon enough, Sam entered meltdown mode, biting and slapping himself, and screaming loud as cannon fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers and parents clamored over to Sam bearing offerings of juice boxes, shovels and pails, blowing bubbles, and sympathy. But Sam wasn't having any of it. His mother struggled to calm him while grasping at the last fragments of her composure. Passersby stopped and stared, looking to pinpoint the flagrant source of upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam's meltdown made me terribly nervous. I felt I had to think of something quick. Then I remembered that Moxie, like Sam, also loves letters. I approached Moxie with some chalk and said, "Letters? Let's write. Moxie and &lt;a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_Hebrew_translation_of_the_word_mother"&gt;Ima&lt;/a&gt; write letters on the sidewalk. Let's go."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nervously etched letters upon the sidewalk, detesting the feeling of chalk on my hand. Moxie jumped up and down saying the letters aloud. I handed him a fat blue piece of half-wet bubble soaked chalk. He went at the sidewalk with a wanton abandon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cast a look at a little girl named Fiona, who happened to be wearing a short pink dress. Rainbow shorts peeked out from beneath her hem and I made a bet that she would like for me to draw a rainbow. She screeched her approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the other children lost interest in Sam's meltdown, they wandered over to me making all sorts of requests from bridges to salamanders. I enlisted the help of a few other straggling parents. I was beginning to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulobrandao/2788050844/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/2788050844_e28da32923_m.jpg" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sam soon settled down and began watching us. I slowly moved closer to him. His head lay on the grass fixated on the letters I wrote. I even copied his style and wrote letters in zigzag lines. Avoiding eye contact, I whispered in a low voice, "Sam. S-A-M," as I made out the big smooth letters. He smiled and flapped. "Now Sam do it." I handed over a neglected piece of nubby green chalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked back over to my spot on the bench. This time, I watched the whole class, including the parents, participate in a mega sidewalk chalk fest. Sam's mother gleefully snapped pictures through misty eyes. She momentarily looked at me and gave me a thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded and said, "Looks like letters are the key to Sam's jubilant participation, eh?" I paused in thought, before adding, "Who knows what it will be next."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'll be sure to keep tabs!" said Sam's mother through a wide grin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Elesia Ashkenazy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238086585907"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/26/breaking-news-science-wins-in-texas-barely/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00821acd4b68e303</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Breaking news: SCIENCE WINS IN TEXAS!!

&lt;p&gt;The State Board of Education voted on the science standards — the list of basic scientific knowledge students should have at various grade levels, like knowing that atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, the Earth goes around the Sun, and — say — evolution is the basic and most fundamental aspect upon which all of modern biology is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists on the board (and there are many) tried to water down the standards by creating a phony baloney &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; amendment, a totally bogus and arbitrary rule that says that teachers have to point out where a theory has faults. They did this specifically to weaken the teaching of evolution in biology classes. They don’t actually care if the students get a solid education on the fact of evolution, they only care to tear down real science and replace it with Biblical literalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And they failed.&lt;/strong&gt; According to the fantastic science-based &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/live-blogging-the-science-debate/#comments"&gt;Texas Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt;, which has been live-blogging the vote, the creationist amendment lost in a 7-7 vote. They could not add the amendment without an actual victory, so the tie means the garbage amendment goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you dance in the streets, have a mind that the vote was tied 7-7. In other words, &lt;em&gt;half the people on the Texas State School Board of Education thought it was fine and dandy that evolution, a foundation of modern science and shown to be fact beyond reasonable doubt,  be taught as being weak and flawed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once again, we see that creationists have lost, but we also know that they will never, ever admit defeat. Remember, their entire outlook on life is not based on reality, but dogma, and so they cannot rest, cannot stop, without shattering their whole worldview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as always, this is not over, despite this advance. It’s a victory for the students of Texas and for reality, but the war will rage on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again (and &lt;a href="http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2283"&gt;I’m not the first&lt;/a&gt;): the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Stay sharp, Texas. They’ll regroup. Bet on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE: &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/live-blogging-the-science-debate-ii/"&gt;TFN notes that a final vote will come Friday on all the standards&lt;/a&gt;, so even this chapter of the battle isn’t over yet. Stay Tuned.]&lt;/p&gt;

Both men stopped in to be interviewed by Harris and Moore about their upcoming debate: &lt;a href="http://www.apologia-podcast.net/"&gt;Special - Live at the Christian Book Expo&lt;/a&gt; (Click the link and scroll down a bit). These two men will debate “Does God Exist?” April 4th, at Biola University. In this interview you'll hear Dr. Craig claiming Hitchens is "incapable" of responding to his arguments. I wouldn't go that far but given Craig's experience as a debater and the fact that he's a professional philosopher, my prediction is that Craig will trounce Hitchens. I wish this wasn't the case, but this is my prediction. [In the poll at the right you can vote on this debate and also vote to see a Craig/Loftus match-up, if you want].&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-4458077529869086368?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://english.pravda.ru/society/anomal/107305-Boguslavka_Meteorite-0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/boguslavka_meteorite.jpg" alt="Boguslavka meteorite"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Pravda — the Russian newspaper whose name translates as &amp;quot;stuff we just make up&amp;quot; — &lt;a href="http://english.pravda.ru/society/anomal/107305-Boguslavka_Meteorite-0"&gt;has an article today&lt;/a&gt; about a meteorite found in Russia almost a century ago that has an image of Jesus in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s actually not that bad a case of pareidolia. The image on the left is the so-called Shroud of Turin, the long-debunked cloth that people erroneously think has the face of Jesus in it. Right away that gives you a sense of the level of accuracy of the Pravda article (of course, the article in the sidebar with a picture of Viveca Fox in a bikini labeled &amp;quot;The chocolate side of Hollywood&amp;quot; gives you even a better sense of their journalistic integrity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://tin.er.usgs.gov/meteor/metbull.php?sea=Boguslavka&amp;amp;sfor=names&amp;amp;ants=&amp;amp;falls=&amp;amp;stype=contains&amp;amp;lrec=50&amp;amp;map=ge&amp;amp;browse=&amp;amp;country=All&amp;amp;srt=name&amp;amp;categ=All&amp;amp;mblist=All&amp;amp;phot=&amp;amp;pnt=no&amp;amp;code=5098"&gt;the meteorite is real enough&lt;/a&gt;. It fell in eastern Russia in 1916, and is called — and you just simply &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to love this — Boguslavka. The total mass that hit was 256 kilos, which is a substantial fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a nickle-iron meteorite (&lt;a href="http://www.encyclopedia-of-meteorites.com/test/bogus2.jpg"&gt;and very very pretty&lt;/a&gt;!) with what looks to me to be a very tight metallic crystal pattern called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widmanst%C3%A4tten_pattern"&gt;the Widmanstätten pattern&lt;/a&gt;; some have large structures in them and some very thin ones. You can find this by slicing the meteorite and getting a flat surface which is then washed with a weak solution of nitric acid; the crystal pattern then pops right out. It can also leave other patterns in the surface, which I strongly suspect is what we’re seeing here, as opposed to an image of, say, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/sikhote_alin_skull.jpg" alt="Sikhote Alin meteorite that looks like a skull"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I have several meteorites myself, and since they tend to have slightly randomized shapes, of course you can see faces and other things in them. One of my favorites is the one shown here, a Sikhote-Alin fragment that also fell in Russia, in 1947. They’re well-known for having a blue-black color on the outside, called the fusion crust, from the heat of blasting through the Earth’s atmosphere. Mine’s about the size of the tip of my thumb, and has a rounded top because it spun as it came in, forming a nosecone or bullet shape. And while it doesn’t look like Jesus, it does bear a strong resemblance to a skull. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from another angle, well, it looks just like Darth Vader. Some people see their religious icons in random patterns, and some see movie icons. I guess it just depends on how you were raised.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238082829654"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=504">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e73afa71dfe6c73c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Brain on a Chip</title><published>2009-03-26T15:33:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T15:33:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=504" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Work continues to develop computers which more closely simulate brain activity. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=500"&gt;As I recently discussed&lt;/a&gt;, the brain is not a computer, and computers are not brains. But since brains operate by physical laws, there is no theoretical reason why we could not design a computer to function like a brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of approach to this - virtual brains and hardwired brain-like computers. The former approach uses conventional computer hardware to simulate a virtual brain. This project is far from achieving this goal, but programmers have already achieved significant milestone, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19767/"&gt;simulation of a cortical column &lt;/a&gt;of 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the virtual approach is that brain structure can be simulated directly without worrying about having to engineer functional neurons or their connections. The downside is that virtual brains require much more processing power than the brains they simulate. So virtual brains run incredibly slowly. It will likely still be 2-3 decades before raw computing power reaches the level where a desktop computer will be able to simulate a human brain in real time. (I am just talking about raw power here, not the knowledge to actually pull off the simulation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the hardwired approach is that you end up with a processor that is much faster than a biological brain. The challenge, however, is in building something in silicon (or whatever) that acts like biological neurons in all the important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22339/page1/"&gt;taken a step in this direction&lt;/a&gt;.The project is called Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States, or FACETS. Their latest product is a silicon chip that has 200,000 “neurons” which make 50 million synapses. This is still tiny compared to the human brain, which has 100 billion neurons. But they plan to connect a bunch of these wafers together into a superchip with 1 billion neurons and 10^23 synapses - still only 1% of the way to the power of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of these chips uses transistors and capacitors to recreate the same kinds of connections that neurons make. Project member Henry Markram has developed an algorithm for the synapses that he calls spike-timing dependent plasticity, which is designed to allow the device to learn and adapt. The chip is designed, like the brain, to be massively parallel. Traditional computers are serial - they can crunch numbers very quickly, but they have one stream of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chip design, it is claimed, combines the power of parallel and adaptive processing with the speed of silicon. They claim it can function 100,000 times faster than a human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the purpose of creating virtual brains is primarily to study the brain (although this line of research may result in artificial intelligence - AI), the purpose of this chip development is not to study the brain at all, but rather to develop more powerful computers and possibly computer AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, while this is an important step, what FACETS is developing is not a silicon brain but a chip that may serve as a basic unit in such a brain. You cannot, in my opinion, just stack a bunch of these chips together and get AI.  A higher order of architecture is required. I guess, although I don’t know, that advancements in this technology - building silicon neurons - will advance more quickly than our understanding of brain architecture and functioning. The latter is progressing nicely, but the level of complexity is much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we may get to the point where we can build a massively parallel and learning silicon computer with the memory and processing power of a human brain, but not know how to put it together to create something we would call AI or, even more difficult, conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am curious as to which approach to designing the overall structure of such a silicon brain will take. The two basic approaches I am thinking of are 1 - duplicating the human brain, or 2 -designing it through trial and error from the ground up. Likely a combined approach will be taken, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also we have to consider what function we wish for the end result. Will it be placed in a robot which will serve as its interface with the outside world, or will it be on a desktop, or will it be the brains of a commercial jet or some other piece of equipment? Or - will it be implanted inside a human to serve as a supplemental brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the approach that will emerge is to first design simple functions, like seeing, interacting with objects, controlling whatever physical form it is in, etc. And then progressively more complex “higher” functions will be added that control the more basic functions. This is exactly how the mammalian brain is organized. This process will be informed by our knowledge of how the brain is organized and functions, but will also have to learn through trial and error to fill in the gaps in our neurological knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course it is always fun to speculate about where this will lead - to Cylons, the Matrix, or to benign and obedient droids. Let’s hope it’s the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of you might be familiar with the work of Walter ReMine. He’s been around the fringes of the online creation-evolution thing for quite a while now. His typical schtick involves the relentless self-promotion of his &lt;a href="http://saintpaulscience.com/" rel="external "&gt;self-published&lt;/a&gt; book &lt;em&gt;The Biotic Message&lt;/em&gt;, which he claims represents a revolutionary new origins theory of some sort. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It’s been a while since &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/how_fast_can_evolution_work.php" rel="external "&gt;ReMine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_the_costs_of_evolution.php" rel="external "&gt;was last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_evolutionary_speed_lim.php" rel="external "&gt;on my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/basic_concepts_measuring_fitne.php" rel="external "&gt;radar screen&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s posted &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/education/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-part-1/" rel="external "&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/philosophy/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-%E2%80%93-part-2/#more-6063" rel="external "&gt;of items&lt;/a&gt; over at Uncommon Descent recently. These are advertised as the first two parts of a multiple-part essay of unspecified length. He promises that this essay will introduce readers to “Message Theory” - a term which he uses often, always with the capital letters, but has yet to actually define. Instead, he devoted all of his &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/education/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-part-1/" rel="external "&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/philosophy/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-%E2%80%93-part-2/#more-6063" rel="external "&gt;half the second&lt;/a&gt; to a discussion of the importance of testability, and why it’s such a good thing that Message Theory is actually testable. (He does not, of course, explain how to test it in either post.) The remaining half-post is devoted to an explanation for why it’s not possible for him to publish his idea in the form of scientific papers - apparently, it’s too wide-ranging and comprehensive to fit in anything less than a book.

The Save The Babies! people are saying that it's one study and not worth getting riled up and changing the recommendation of the American Acadamy of Pediatrics - which is that there is not enough information to justify circumcision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm firmly in the Don't Cut The Babies camp, but this is interesting stuff.  My opinion is that (a) why do we have to apply this data across the board?  Uganda and Kenya are not Canada, the United States or any country in Europe.  While the operation may reduce HIV risk by up to 60%, proper and regular condom use makes that number shoot up to 90%.  A combination might be better (provided the fucking pope doesn't open his asshole mouth) in these African countries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then (b), in Canada we're using the HPV vaccine that seems to be effective to well above 90% (although some parents are &lt;a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090303/HPV_vaccine_090303/20090303?hub=Health"&gt;sketchy on giving it&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for *surprise!* religious "we have to keep cervical cancer as a threat to keep our girls from premarital sex" reasons) plus condom use and good sex education which keeps HIV infection rates low (0.3% for adults - from &lt;a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ca&amp;amp;v=32"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Circumcising babies still seems like a barbaric non-solution to a problem that is being handled through other, more logical and humane avenues.  Commenter Mark Lyndon on the original Science News article makes a good point:&lt;blockquote&gt;Babies aren't going to be getting any STI's before they're old enough to decide for themselves whether or not they want part of their genitals cut off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This cuts to the heart of the issue for me which is, don't permanently alter someone else's body when they're unable/unfit to choose.  Saying that babies should be circumcised because of religous, cultural, or worst of all, asthetic reasons is to make an argument on extremely thin ice.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

In all that time, it seems, the octopus hasn&amp;#39;t evolved — not one tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Scientists aren't baffled at all by this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Superficially, this is true — they do say it is 95 million years old. Farah is trying to spin it, though, by implying it is only a &amp;quot;claim&amp;quot;. It is a conclusion supported by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;There are hundreds of octopod species. The level of description Farah provides is about what a four-year-old with a crayon might say, and it's false. They (there were several species identified) do not look like modern octopods, but have several tell-tale differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Completely false. Farah hasn't read the paper, which fits these fossils into a long history of evolutionary change in the lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's an impressive collection of falsehoods. It takes a creationist to screw up a story that thoroughly, I guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/even_dumber_than_denyse_oleary.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/TUEr2qmeMko" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238076604939"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/god_abortionist.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d5da89ecc016a70</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">God, abortionist</title><published>2009-03-26T13:49:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T13:49:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9dJ0FBY0a9w/god_abortionist.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/god_abortionist.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another revelation in the tragic &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_heartless_faith.php#more"&gt;Montanaplane crash endorsed by anti-choice freaks&lt;/a&gt;: one of the women on the plane was &lt;a href="http://thewelltimedperiod.blogspot.com/2009/03/gingi-edmonds-supports-forced-second.html"&gt;five months pregnant&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning's Takeaway (at about 6:30 a.m. or 8:30 a.m.&lt;br&gt;
Eastern), we're talking with Don McLeroy, chair of the Texas State&lt;br&gt;
Board of Education. He's believes that students should have the&lt;br&gt;
opportunity to question evolution (and that God created the Earth a&lt;br&gt;
few thousand years ago). Texas is expected to vote this week on new&lt;br&gt;
science standards that could influence textbooks and how more states&lt;br&gt;
treat this controversial issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas Board of Education is in the midst of a major fight this&lt;br&gt;
week over a new science curriculum that's designed to challenge the&lt;br&gt;
principle of evolution. The Board will vote tomorrow on standards that&lt;br&gt;
will govern science teaching on evolution in Texas for the next 10&lt;br&gt;
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Mama Mia&lt;/i&gt; movie has revitalised interest in Swedish 70s pop giants ABBA. The other day I heard 10-y-o Junior's school choir perform "As Good As New". 5-y-o Juniorette and her pals at daycare sing garbled versions of all the hits, such as "Oo-nay-boo" ("Voulez-Vous").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with ABBA and I'm still a big fan. But I haven't listened systematically through their &lt;i&gt;oeuvre&lt;/i&gt;, haven't really paid much attention to the lyrics as I do when I encounter new music. Looking at "Voulez-Vous", the title track of the band's sixth 1979 album, I found something funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Voulez-Vous" is a rousing disco tune, set to raise your pulse and make your pelvis wiggle. The French words mean "Do you want to?". Its musical mood is excitement, anticipation of something pretty steamy:&lt;blockquote&gt;People everywhere&lt;br&gt;
A sense of expectation hanging in the air&lt;br&gt;
Giving out a spark&lt;br&gt;
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But reading the lyrics, I realise that the song's a bit of a joke: it's actually about being &lt;i&gt;bored&lt;/i&gt; with the disco meat-market:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end&lt;br&gt;
Masters of the scene&lt;br&gt;
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more&lt;br&gt;
You know what I mean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andersson and Ulvaeus are about 33 years old here. They've made all the disco conquests they care to make. Though still certainly not unaffected by music, they're no longer very excited by the prospect of taking a stranger to bed.&lt;blockquote&gt;Voulez-vous?&lt;br&gt;
Take it now or leave it&lt;br&gt;
Now is all we get&lt;br&gt;
Nothing promised, no regrets&lt;br&gt;
Voulez-vous?&lt;br&gt;
Ain't no big decision&lt;br&gt;
You know what to do&lt;br&gt;
I can still say "Voulez-vous?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while I'm at it, let me point out that "Feel the beat on the tambourine" is a really strained rhyme. The beat? On a frickin' &lt;i&gt;tambourine&lt;/i&gt;?

Not surprisingly, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/does_alternative_medicine_use_result_in.php"&gt;found no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that any such therapy did, with the possible exception of melatonin, which there is no reason to label "alternative," given that it was discovered through science and is being tested using science. At the same time, I've been keeping an eye on the usual suspects pushing various forms of woo for breast cancer, mainly because I'm always on the lookout for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/understanding_alternative_medi_1.php"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little more than a year ago, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/a_horrifying_breast_cancer_testimonial_f.php"&gt;analyzed one such breast cancer testimonia&lt;/a&gt;l by a woman named Kim Tinkham. Ms. Tinkham is a woman in her early fifties who was most famous for having been on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt; in March 2007 having claimed to have beaten breast cancer using only "alternative" methods while . Of course, I noted that, as of January 2008, Ms. Tinkham had said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;She can still feel the tumor just underneath the surface of her skin, where it will probably remain for a while.

&lt;p&gt;But she knows it's harmless. Now, it's simply her badge of honor - the reminder that she, Kim Tinkham, defeated cancer without any surgery, invasive procedures, radiation or chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, apparently her definition of being "cancer free" meant that she had undergone some blood test or other ordered by a particularly dubious "alternative" practitioner named &lt;a href="http://articlesofhealth.blogspot.com"&gt;Robert O. Young&lt;/a&gt;. We've met Young before on this blog multiple times. In essence, he believes that cancer and in essence all disease is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_acid_base_or_woo_2.php"&gt;caused by acid&lt;/a&gt;, how viruses are "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/viruses_are_molecular_acids.php"&gt;molecular acids&lt;/a&gt;" and sepsis is supposedly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/sepsis_is_not_caused_by_infection.php"&gt;not caused by bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, and that the cure for all disease is alkalinization. In other words, Young is a Woomeister Supreme, slinging stuff that shouldn't sound plausible to anyone who's taken high school biology. Unfortunately, Ms. Tinkham believes in him totally, which led her to be able to delude herself into believing her cancer was gone, even though the mass was still obviously palpable within her breast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, Young decided to give us an update on Ms. Tinkham.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/a_horrifying_breast_cancer_testimonial_f_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/a_horrifying_breast_cancer_testimonial_f_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/8rHoi2PxQMQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238073939225"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6611">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec0e18cfeac35c4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 3.26</title><published>2009-03-26T13:00:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T13:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6611" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

You know, something that uses astrology and combines it with a practical, everyday gadget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me neither. But &lt;a href="http://borgeaudwatches.com/automatic.html"&gt;Swiss watchmaker Borgeaud&lt;/a&gt; thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borgeaud has released a watch that will display a daily, 90 minute period known as the Raju Kaal (Rahukaalam, Rahu Kalam) that, according to Indian astrology, is considered an inauspicious period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panchangam, the Hindu astrological calendar. The Panchangam, published in India by many authors, societies, academies, and universities, forcast natural phenomena such as solar eclipses and weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study of Panchangas involves understanding Rasi phala, the impact of the signs of the zodiac on the individual. Astrologers consult the Panchangam to set auspicious dates for weddings, corporate mergers, and other worldly activities as per religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the time periods in the Panchangam is the Rahukaalam, which lasts around 90 minutes every day. The 90 minute period is different for each day depending on the planetary configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday: 7:30am - 9:00am&lt;br&gt;
Tuesday: 3:00pm - 4:30pm&lt;br&gt;
Wednesday: 12:00pm - 1:30pm&lt;br&gt;
Thursday: 1:30pm - 3:00pm&lt;br&gt;
Friday: 10:30am - 12:00pm&lt;br&gt;
Saturday: 9:00am - 10:30am&lt;br&gt;
Sunday: 4:30pm - 6:00pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to ancient Indian astronomers, the planets were the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Even though Rahu and Ketu are not actual planets, they are considered sensitive points on the intersection of the ecliptic by the Moon’s orbit. Rahu is the northern point and Ketu is the southern point. Ancient astronomers felt that Rahu and Kethu have the strength to eat the sun, thus causing a solar eclipse.&lt;br&gt;
Hence it is considered inauspicious to begin any undertaking during this “Rahukaalam”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borgeaud has teamed up with Indian astrologers to bring us this beautiful watch. Limited edition and numbered, you can expect to pay about $2000USD for this fine fortune-telling device.&lt;/p&gt;

I suggested in "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001913.html"&gt;Fossilized prejudices about &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" that Strunk had some basis for his prejudices, since novels of the time really did seem to prefer &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; in second position.  This was a modest defense of Strunk, whose horrid little book I regard as almost entirely mistaken in the grammatical advice it purveys.  Michael Stillwell has now discovered that my defense evidence was flagrantly mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I asserted that in Bram Stoker's &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt; (1897) there were 79 cases of "&lt;tt&gt;, however,&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot; — indicating a second-position use — but no occurrences at all of the string &amp;quot;&lt;tt&gt;However,&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot; — which is what you would find in a case of the adverb in the sentence-initial position that Strunk advises against.  But it has been pointed out to me by Michael Stillwell that (there is no other way to put it) mistakes were made.  He gets 18 occurrences of &amp;quot;&lt;tt&gt;However,&lt;/tt&gt;" in &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt;; and on re-checking my own file of the text of that novel I get 17 (we must have slightly differing files of the text). Clearly I mistyped something when I did my count in 2005, and looked for a pattern that never occurred.  So my erroneous result must be, and hereby is, retracted.  &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt; confirms what I would have expected: that the adverb &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; was perfectly normal in sentence-initial position in novels published when Strunk was a young man.  A sixth of Stoker's uses of adverb &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; are sentence-initial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever error I made in the search command on &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt;, I then apparently repeated on Joseph Conrad's &lt;i&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; (1902), perhaps by re-using a command line.  The figure of 3 cases of second-position &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; was correct, but although I said there were no cases of initial-position &lt;i&gt;However&lt;/i&gt;, that was another mistake: the figure is 8.  So Conrad's prose, dating from the time when Strunk was in the early stages of his academic career, clearly disconfirms his style prejudice: 73 percent of Conrad's occurrences &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; in that novel are sentence-initial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also messed up the search on Jack London's &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; (1903): I said it was 4 second-position and none sentence-initial; the correct figures are 5 second-position and 1 sentence-initial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only novel I looked in 2005 where my count was right was H. G. Wells's &lt;i&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/i&gt; (1898).  Re-checking the text of Wells's novel confirms that it has 10 second-position occurrences of &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; and none that are sentence-initial, so it is written in a way that conforms to (or perhaps forms part of the basis for) Strunk's prejudice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the lessons here?  I see three: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Results in linguistics need to be re-checked, and attempts at replication, even of apparently very simple things like counts of word sequences in familiar literary works, will sometimes be very useful. People make mistakes.  And I am people too.  Many thanks to Michael Stillwell for discovering my error.  And apologies to Language Log readers who trusted me to get things right.  I goofed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll need a larger corpus of results on placement of &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; in prose of the half century between 1869 (when Strunk was born) and 1919 (when he taught English grammar at Cornell to the man who was later to revise &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt;, E. B. White) if we are to figure out the degree of textual support for Strunk: his edict looks implausible either as grammar rule or as style recommendation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contrary to what I said in 2005, the present state of play is that so far there is no support for Strunk's rule, except that H. G. Wells did avoid sentence-initial &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; in at least one of his novels. Research continues. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That was then.  This is now, and now I couldn&amp;#39;t convince a two-year-old German toddler that I&amp;#39;m not just another weird, inarticulate, incompetent foreigner.  I haven&amp;#39;t been back to Germany often since the year I spent here in Freiburg way back when, and in all this time I&amp;#39;ve been busily losing the brain cells that contained my knowledge of the language.  Now I&amp;#39;m at the end of a month spent at a research institute at the university, and because all my linguist acquaintances speak English so well, I haven&amp;#39;t had much luck in reactivating any latent German skills — it&amp;#39;d be cruel to make people puzzle over my inept German when we could instead be chattering away productively in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-seven years is a long time, and prominent in the long list of things I&amp;#39;ve forgotten are words and grammatical gender assignment.  I could get away with some variation in noun gender, if only my problem were a bit more restricted.  Take Schorle, for instance.  I&amp;#39;ve been drinking a lot of Apfelschorle this month — it&amp;#39;s very good, a mixture of apple juice and fizzy mineral water.  (You can tell that I&amp;#39;m typing this on my own computer and not on the German computer in my office here, because I&amp;#39;m not putting z&amp;#39;s where my y&amp;#39;s belong and vice versa.)  There&amp;#39;s also Weinschorle, a mixture of wine and fizzy mineral water; that, I wouldn&amp;#39;t particularly recommend.  At lunch a couple of weeks ago, I asked a bunch of doctoral students and postdocs what the gender of Schorle is.  Much inconclusive discussion resulted.  For one postdoc they&amp;#39;re both feminine (&lt;i&gt;die Apfelschorle, die Weinschorle&lt;/i&gt;); for another, they're both neuter (&lt;i&gt;das Apfelschorle, das Weinschorle&lt;/i&gt;); and still another has &lt;i&gt;die Apfelschorle&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;das Weinschorle&lt;/i&gt;.  The German Wikipedia, de.wikipedia.org, says that the term &lt;i&gt;Schorle&lt;/i&gt;, in a different formation, dates back to the 18th century, and that the word is feminine, except in southern Germany — where Freiburg is — where occasionally, rarely, it is neuter.  If only more words were like Apfelschorle, I could assign whatever gender I wanted to any given noun, and my German would sound a whole lot better than it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Freiburg has changed a lot since 1962.  Then, there was no McDonald&amp;#39;s sign on the ancient city gate called the Martinstor.  (Also I now have enough money to eat regularly; in 1962, after months of eating almost nothing but Eintopf in the university Mensa, I collapsed with a rather serious case of malnutrition.)  And the presence of English is more striking now than it was back then, although even then I had to join the Russischer Chor der Universität Freiburg to find people whose English wasn&amp;#39;t a great deal better than my then-incipient German.  Take the wonderful research institute I&amp;#39;m visiting this month, for instance.  It&amp;#39;s called FRIAS, which stands for Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.  That&amp;#39;s right: the name of the university&amp;#39;s elegant new research institute is English.  They tell me that it reflects the international outlook of the institute, and I appreciate that; but speaking as someone who finds English ultimately a bit boring, compared to other languages, I&amp;#39;m unenthusiastic about yet another instance of English encroachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the brewery and restaurant Martin&amp;#39;s Bräu (&amp;quot;Martin&amp;#39;s Brew&amp;quot;).  It is spelled with that apostrophe, like an English possessive but unlike normal German (compare, for instance, the name of the Tor mentioned above: Martinstor).  Don&amp;#39;t take my word for it — look at the logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.martinsbraeu-freiburg.de/images/logo_normal.jpg" height="400" width="40%" border="2" alt="The Martin&amp;#39;s Brau logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know that the apostrophe in the possessive &lt;i&gt;Martin's&lt;/i&gt; has anything to do with English influence — for one thing, like the brewery-restaurant itself, it&amp;#39;s old, and as far as I can discover it has always had the apostrophe.  I&amp;#39;ve asked German friends to explain this.  They say they have no idea why that apostrophe is there.  Bernd Kortmann did tell me that apostrophes are creeping into borrowed nouns that are pluralized with &lt;i&gt;-s&lt;/i&gt; (native German nouns tend to have different plural formations, not a suffix &lt;i&gt;-s&lt;/i&gt;); but this new practice (though interesting) seems quite different from Martin&amp;#39;s Bräu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the English-language advertising signs, the desecration of the old city gate by an American fast-food chain, and the occasional wayward apostrophe, Freiburg remains a beautiful and congenial city.  We can walk from our university guest-house apartment in several directions and get up into the Schwarzwald, on paths that lead to pleasant cafes with gorgeous views.  We can conform to local custom by sitting at outdoor cafe tables in near-freezing temperatures eating ice-cream.  We can stroll around the Altstadt on tiny-smooth-cobblestone sidewalks and examine the latest scaffolding on the always-scaffolded Cathedral.  But after we leave tomorrow, I'll continue to regret my inability to magically resuscitate my former German fluency this past month.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Thomason</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238056142983"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2655">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28f097bbab2d7d3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="Weirdness"/><category term="Love"/><category term="Objectophilia"/><title type="html">Objectophilia?</title><published>2009-03-26T07:11:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T07:11:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/objectophilia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some people who literally fall in love with physical objects instead of human beings.

Another married the Berlin Wall in the 70’s. That one didn’t end well. Another woman had a relationship with a guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;

That "Amber" chick - if it is a chick - is a good enough satire writer that she pulled me in, until the &lt;a href="http://christwire.org/2009/03/vampire-discovered-in-mass-grave/"&gt;vampire article&lt;/a&gt;.  I suggest you read it for some hilarious Poeitude.  Poe-itry?  Poe-verty?  I'll stop.&lt;blockquote&gt;Main Entry:&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;blas·phe·my&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pronunciation: \ˈblas-fə-mē\&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Function: noun &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Inflected Form(s): plural blas·phe·mies&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Date: 13th century&lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;1 a: the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence for God b: the act of claiming the attributes of deity2: irreverence toward something considered sacred or inviolable. (from &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sadly, it's on to something not nearly as funny. The &lt;a href="http://www.alhewar.com/ISLAMDECL.html"&gt;Islamic Declaration of Human Rights (IDHR)&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, technically, Canada still has an "anti blasphemy law" in its books.  Check it out, from the &lt;a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/"&gt;Criminal Code of Canada&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Blasphemous Libel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Offence&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;296. (1) Every one who publishes a blasphemous libel is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question of fact&lt;br&gt;(2) It is a question of fact whether or not any matter that is published is a blasphemous libel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saving&lt;br&gt;(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section for expressing in good faith and in decent language, or attempting to establish by argument used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, an opinion on a religious subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R.S., c. C-34, s. 260.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So we're not one to really be throwing around the holier than thou talk.  Of course though, this archaic "law" has been swallowed by &lt;i&gt;article two&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/#garantie"&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; (CCRF), which starts with the stomach-churning line, &lt;i&gt;"Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law:"&lt;/i&gt;.  Um, how about no?  Can we take out that "supremacy of God" bit, please?  At least they separated the law and God.  Small things.  Ok, the CCRF says:&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    a) freedom of conscience and religion; &lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;    c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and &lt;br&gt;    d) freedom of association. &lt;/blockquote&gt;So, there's that with my bolding.  The thing that I find bothersome about the IDHR is &lt;i&gt;article XII&lt;/i&gt; which states:&lt;blockquote&gt;XII Right to Freedom of Belief, Thought and Speech&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) Every person has the right to express his thoughts and beliefs &lt;b&gt;so long as he remains within the limits prescribed by the Law&lt;/b&gt;. No one, however, is entitled to disseminate falsehood or to circulate reports which may outrage public decency, or to indulge in slander, innuendo or to cast defamatory aspersions on other persons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) Pursuit of knowledge and search after truth is not only a right but a duty of every Muslim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) It is the right and duty of every Muslim to protest and strive (within the limits set out by the Law) against oppression even if it involves challenging the highest authority in the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) There shall be no bar on the dissemination of information provided it does not endanger the security of the society or the state and is confined within the limits imposed by the Law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;e) &lt;b&gt;No one shall hold in contempt or ridicule the religious beliefs of others&lt;/b&gt; or incite public hostility against them; &lt;b&gt;respect for the religious feelings of others is obligatory on all Muslims&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;All my bolding, obviously.  The idea that this lame-duck document would even attempt to make people (me) stop poking fun at ludicrous and dangerous ideas like religions is laughable.  You think a guy rode to Heaven on a winged horse, for fuck's sake.  I don't even HAVE to make fun of that.  It's like listening to a homeopath or young-Earth creationist try to sound scientific - it's hilarious enough to just sit back and hold my aching sides against the stitch that will eventually double me over in convulsions of mirth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Islamic nations seem to be trying to use this anti-blasphemy declaration to, possibly, keep the death penalty for apostates around and have a legal leg to stand on when questioned by other member-states.  I could be wrong, but weirder things have happened.  Like not having the goddamn &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;word&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; blasphemy until the 13th century.

Some people feel that it is indelicate to use the “q” word (for the uninitiated, “q” is for “quack”) when describing practitioners who promote disproven therapies with jubilant fervor. Others believe it unkind to lump “well meaning” &lt;a href="http://www.chopra.com/"&gt;alternative medicine experts&lt;/a&gt; in with those who are engaged in overtly &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5043005/whos-smiling-now-enzyte-scammer-gets-25-years-in-prison"&gt;illegal activities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all affected by the tension between wanting to call a spade a spade and respecting our cultural need to be polite. Perhaps one of the clearest examples of this inner conflict is Orac’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; blog. As the name implies, Orac is both thoughtful and brutally honest - he expresses our communal reticence to make waves, but follows up with a reasoned hostility that is quite understandable, given the circumstances described in each post. &lt;em&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/em&gt; is fun to read because it is educational, persuasive, and expressive - and it captures how many of us feel about various forms of hucksterism. However, snake oil salesmen and their sympathizers are unlikely to enjoy the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;em&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, readers find a wide range of expression with a common commitment to science and reason. Just as physicians have different practice styles (some are more nurturing in temperament, others offer “tough love”) so too do we authors vary in tone. For those readers who favor one style over another - I hope you’ll find the voice that suits you and return regularly for more. Please don’t assume that one particular post is representative of the entire blog, and please don’t be offended by the legitimate exasperation of writers who have suffered through decades of observing swindlers swindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me - I learned that one approach doesn’t fit all.  In his recent book, “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quit-Digging-Your-Grave-Knife/dp/0446578061/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1238033852&amp;amp;sr=8-5"&gt;Quit Digging Your Grave With A Knife And Fork&lt;/a&gt;,” Mike Huckabee attributes his extraordinary weight loss to the brutal honesty of his primary care physician. His physician sat him down one day and explained exactly how he would most likely die from diabetes if he did not radically change his lifestyle. He described the vascular disease that would (if left unchecked) cause vision loss, kidney damage, skin ulcers and potential limb amputations, heart attacks and stroke. He was so shocked by this message that he embarked on a new way of life - and lost over 100 pounds with diet and exercise. His blood sugar levels returned to normal, and he is not currently at risk for diabetes-associated health complications. Quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I had an obese patient who was in a similar predicament. I sat her down and explained how serious her condition was, and how she had the ability to make a brighter future for herself through weight loss and regular exercise. I pleaded with her to lose weight, and counseled her on how to do so safely and effectively. I was firm with her, but encouraging. She left my office that day and never returned. Apparently my advice was not appreciated. I was crestfallen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough love doesn’t work for everyone, and calling out pseudoscience and quackery is not always welcomed. But for those who have ears to hear, the message is important and powerful - and in some cases, life-saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Emil Freireich, winner of a recent&lt;a href="http://www.getbetterhealth.com/extraordinary-physicians-honored-for-advances-in-medicine/2009.03.24"&gt; lifetime achievement award&lt;/a&gt; for his contributions to leukemia research, told me that Houston, Texas is home to a cottage industry of alternative medicine practitioners who sell expensive miracle cures to patients who have not found success at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The practitioners prey on the hopes of dying patients, fleecing their families out of thousands upon thousands of dollars with potions that include everything from mere water to concentrated urine. I’m not sure what we should call such individuals, but “quack” seems awfully kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is committed to encouraging honesty, integrity, and scientific accuracy in healthcare. We shine a light on misleading claims and explore areas of ethical conflict wherever pseudoscience is found. Some of us do this with bold strokes, others with gentle persuasion. The goal is to empower patients, enlighten our peers, and move us all towards better health via sound science and thoughtful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you doubt that we’re actually a very affable bunch, why not join us at the upcoming Science Based Medicine &lt;a href="http://www.getbetterhealth.com/announcing-the-science-based-medicine-conference/2009.03.14"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past few years, honey bee keepers have experienced problems due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which has hurt honey bee populations, causing some growers of fruits, nuts and vegetables to wonder how their crops will be pollinated in the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090321103809.htm" title=""&gt;Bees Prefer Shortest Distance Between Two Flowers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Insects such as honeybees and bumble bees are predictable in the way they move among flowers, typically moving directly from one flower to an adjacent cluster of flowers in the same row of plants. The bees' flight paths have a direct affect on their ability to hunt for pollen and generate "gene flow", fertilization and seed production that results when pollen moves from one plant to another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide is largely responsible for recent global warming and the rise in sea levels. However, a team of scientists, including two Smithsonian ecologists, have found that this same increase in CO2 may ironically counterbalance some of its negative effects on one of the planet's most valuable ecosystems--wetlands.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_635.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/dTIDUQfsfOs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238050218556"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_142.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/497acfc07f92648d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-03-26T03:22:53Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T03:22:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/RjZZmAPmnMY/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_142.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_142.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=3&amp;amp;day=26&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;8 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005023" title=""&gt;A Dance to the Music of Time: Aesthetically-Relevant Changes in Body Posture in Performing Art&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In performing arts, body postures are both means for expressing an artist's intentions, and also artistic objects, appealing to the audience. The postures of classical ballet obey the body's biomechanical limits, but also follow strict rules established by tradition. This combination offers a perfect milieu for assessing scientifically how the execution of this particular artistic activity has changed over time, and evaluating what factors may induce such changes. We quantified angles between body segments in archive material showing dancers from a leading company over a 60-year period. The data showed that body positions supposedly fixed by codified choreography were in fact implemented by very different elevation angles, according to the year of ballet production. Progressive changes lead to increasingly vertical positions of the dancer's body over the period studied. Experimental data showed that these change reflected aesthetic choices of naïve modern observers. Even when reduced to stick figures and unrecognisable shapes, the more vertical postures drawn from later productions were systematically preferred to less vertical postures from earlier productions. This gradual change within a conservative art form provides scientific evidence that aesthetic change may arise from continuous interaction between artistic tradition, individual artists' creativity, and a wider environmental context. This context may include social aesthetic pressure from audiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005015" title=""&gt;Early Fasting Is Long Lasting: Differences in Early Nutritional Conditions Reappear under Stressful Conditions in Adult Female Zebra Finches&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004996" title=""&gt;The Growth of Easements as a Conservation Tool&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The numerous studies examining where efforts to conserve biodiversity should be targeted are not matched by comparable research efforts addressing how conservation investments should be structured and what balance of conservation approaches works best in what contexts. An obvious starting point is to examine the past allocation of effort among conservation approaches and how this has evolved. We examine the past allocation of conservation investment between conservation easements and fee simple acquisitions using the largest land trust in operation, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), as a case study. We analyse the balance of investments across the whole of the US and in individual states when measured in terms of the area protected and upfront cost of protecting land. Across the US as a whole, the proportion of conservation investment allocated to easements is growing exponentially. Already 70% of the area of land protected in a given year, and half of all the financial investment in land conservation, is allocated to easements. The growth rate of conservation easements varies by a factor of two across states when measured in terms of the area protected and by a factor of three in terms of financial expenditure. Yet, we were unable to find consistent predictors that explained this variation. Our results underscore the urgency of implementing best practice guidelines for designing easements and of initiating a wider discussion of what balance of conservation approaches is desirable.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_142.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/RjZZmAPmnMY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238049272318"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2652">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30b5382ef251491f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Sharks"/><title type="html">Evolution Of Fins And Limbs Linked With That Of Gills</title><published>2009-03-26T06:33:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T06:33:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/evolution-of-fins-and-limbs-linked-with-that-of-gills/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090323212021.htm"&gt;ScienceDaily reports&lt;/a&gt; that a new study has found that the same genetic toolkit that animals use to build fins and limbs also controls the development of part of the gill skeleton in sharks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, the skeleton of any appendage off the body of an animal is probably patterned by the developmental genetic program that we have traced back to formation of gills in sharks,” said Andrew Gillis, lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at the University of Chicago. “We have pushed back the evolutionary origin of the developmental genetic program that patterns fins and limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new finding is consistent with an old theory, often discounted in science textbooks, that fins and (later) limbs evolved from the gills of an extinct vertebrate, Gillis added. “A dearth of fossils prevents us from definitely concluding that fins evolved from gills. Nevertheless, this research shows that the genetic architecture of gills, fins and limbs is the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research builds on the breakthrough discovery of the fossil Tiktaalik, a “fish with legs,” by Neil Shubin and his colleagues in 2006. “This is another example of how evolution uses common developmental programs to pattern different anatomical structures,” said Shubin, who is the senior author on the PNAS paper and Professor and Associate Dean of Organismal and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. “In this case, shared developmental mechanisms pattern the skeletons of vertebrate gill arches and paired fins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, once again another slam dunk for evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know quite whether to laugh or cringe at this one. &lt;a href="http://christwire.org/2009/02/is-it-ok-for-my-christian-daughter-to-masturbate/"&gt;A woman asks an advice columnist&lt;/a&gt; what to do about her daughter who she discovered has “one of those electronic phallic objects in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the advice she received back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Concerned in San Diego,&lt;br&gt;
You need to immediately take that sinful device from your daughter. Masturbation is another form of pornography that will infest your daughter’s mind and serve as a gateway to far worse sexual activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studies show that 87% of the women who become prostitutes did so because of unbridled masturbation as a teenager, and over 90% of girls who become pregnant as teenagers did so because of masturbation loosened their morals and made them more apt to engage in unprotected fornication. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masturbation will make your daughter very comfortable exploring her body, and it will not be long until she begins to envision other people partaking in the deviant behavior with her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This will of course lead to your daughter seeking out a male companion, or even female. As a teenager, your daughter’s mind is not yet developed enough to handle the pressures and responsibilities of being sexually active. It will lead to great sorrow in her life if you don’t put a stop to it right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So first, have a talk with your daughter and pray with her. Pray all that sinful desire of masturbation right out of her heart. Throw the device away, and then enroll her in some abstinence counseling sessions. These will teach your daughter the value and need of respecting her body until marriage. Masturbation is very unnatural and by taking proactive steps to get this bizarre behavior out of your teen’s life, you’ll ensure she has a better future.&lt;br&gt;
-Amber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the good news is that contrary to Amber’s facts and statistics that she pulled out of her ass, where she keeps her prudish stick, her daughter would probably not have become a prostitute. The bad news is now there’s an excellent chance she will now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Amber’s awesome advice, I encourage everyone to write her your own advice questions at &lt;a href="mailto:askamber@christwire.org"&gt;askamber@christwire.org&lt;/a&gt;. This could be fun. I would like to know, for instance, if I step on a crack, will it really break my mother’s back?&lt;/p&gt;

And despite the fact that Sullenberger was quite clear in stating he did not pray and that every passenger on that plane owed their life to the Sullenberger’s training and experience, the story became universally known as “Miracle on the Hudson!” With all that talk of miracles, one might have thought mighty Zeus himself reached out his hand to catch the plane and gently set it down on the water. But he didn’t and no in fact no magical beings from Olympus, Heaven, or Narnia had a hand in the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when a pilot really does rely on a miracle instead of their training? &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7962082.stm"&gt;They crash hard, get people killed, and end up in jail:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Italian court has jailed a Tunisian pilot who paused to pray instead of taking emergency measures before ditching his plane, killing 16 people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to self: never get on a plane with a religious pilot. I think I’ll call this story “Miracle off the coast of Sicily.”&lt;/p&gt;

Poor them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will not accept the Pope being made the object of mockery and offence, in the media or elsewhere,” said Angelo Bagnasco, the country’s top bishop, citing the “controversy about condoms”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He represents for everyone a moral authority, which this journey has made people appreciate even more,” Bagnasco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moral authority? LOL What are you smokin’? Condoms are 90% effective in preventing HIV and other STDs and Captain Moral Authority over there told people it made the spread of AIDS worse. This is the same guy who compared homosexuality to destroying the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe Bagnasco is right. We shouldn’t be making fun of the Joey Ratz. We should be locking him away in prison for using his authority so irresponsibly to the detriment of the entire continent of Africa, as well as the world. Stop mocking him? GO FUCK YOURSELF! And to Captain Moral Authority, TAKE THAT STUPID POINTY HAT OF YOURS AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!&lt;/p&gt;

I learned of a recent post at a blog called &lt;a href="http://fengshuiforward.com/about/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fengshui Forward&lt;/a&gt; (“We aim to gather fellow Chinese Metaphysics enthusiatics to discuss and promote Chinese 5 arts”), entitled &lt;a href="http://fengshuiforward.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;United we stand, Divided we fall!&lt;/a&gt;.  The author, ken, is bothered by the &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/02/featured_dvd_pe.html"&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Teller Bullshit&lt;/a&gt; episode on Feng Shui – the one where each of the three Feng Shui experts comes up with completely different recommended colors and arrangements of furniture at the exact same house.  Unfortunately ken has completely missed the point of the P&amp;amp;T program, and criticisms of Feng Shui in general: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is very easy to discredit a practice like Feng Shui because Metaphysics is defined by Wikipedia as “investigates principles of reality transcending those of any particular science”.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, that’s not how to discredit Feng Shui, although I agree it is  easy to discredit.  P&amp;amp;T discredit Feng Shui not by reference to a definition in Wikipedia (which would be an absurd way to do it anyway), but by simply showing that three so called “experts”, all using the exact same “science”, come up with completely different recommendations for the same problem.  Let’s face it – they can’t all be right.  The fact that they’re all different just demonstrates to any rational person that it’s nonsense.  How would you tell which of the recommendations was right and which wrong?  If Feng Shui had any actual real effect then it ought to be possible to tell by testing.  But according to ken, you can’t test Feng Shui:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feng Shui is not superstitious.  It merely looks superstitious because it is beyond science and hence science cannot explain it and neither can humans.  How do you expect a kid to explain the action of his parents?  Since Feng Shui transcends science, one cannot get a satisfactory explanation of Feng Shui using scientific principles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Beyond science”?  Science is just an organized way of testing hypotheses against reality.  The phrase “beyond science” just means “can’t be tested to see if it works”.  But why not?  If it has any real effect surely that effect must be measurable (ie it is testable).  If it’s effects really aren’t measurable, then what is the difference between Feng Shui and something that doesn’t exist?  (Clearly, nothing.)  In reality, what ken means by “beyond science”, is “&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be tested to see if it works – we just won’t admit it doesn’t”.  This is just &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/12/the_appeal_to_s.html"&gt;science doesn&amp;#39;t know everything&lt;/a&gt; combined with an &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/10/the_appeal_to_o.html"&gt;appeal to other ways of knowing&lt;/a&gt; – a smokescreen to hide the fact that Feng Shui is made up nonsense that has very little correspondence with reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of any basis Feng Shui has in reality is hilariously (and unintentionally) exposed in ken’s appeal for unity among fellow woomeisters:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If even Feng Shui enthuasiasts (sic) and practitioners can be going all out to discredit someone with the same beliefs, what more outsiders who are like Penn &amp;amp; Teller?  Sometimes I wish fellow enthusiasts in Chinese Metaphysics wisen (sic) up and not be the proverbial “divided loose grains of sand”.  If we help each other in this interest group or profession, Chinese Metaphysics &amp;amp; Feng Shui as a whole stands to gain.  We as enthusiasts and practitioner of the same field stand to gain too.  After all, one famous Chinese saying by the victimized Cao Zhi in the Romance of the 3 Kingdom goes “Why cannibalize one that is of the same family?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can we help each other?  By treating fellow practitioners and enthusiasts as allies and suggest areas of weakness as points to consider for improvement.  By not treating fellow practitioners and enthusiasts as rivals and going all out to attack one perceived point of fallible practice or advocate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Translation: “don’t criticize someone else’s woo even if it makes no sense, because they might criticize your woo for making no sense.”  Of course, in actual science, scientists do criticize each other.  It’s only by criticizing and dismissing weak ideas, that the good ones can flourish.  But then with actual science, they have a way to determine what is real and what isn’t – they look at evidence.  This is of course a problem for woo such as Feng Shui, since with no evidence and no way of testing it (it transcends science, remember), there is no way to determine what is real and what isn’t.  Consequently woomeisters such as ken have no option but to accept uncritically everyone else’s woo.  And that’s the problem (one of them, anyway) with woo.  With no rational way of testing your hypothesis against reality, you are in freefall – you have to believe in everything.  Ken really is in danger of being so open minded that his brains will fall out.  If they haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238044170462"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85765f246aa7989a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">A U.

The  contentious "blasphemy" resolution presented by Pakistan, introduced at the UN and supported by some of the Middle East regimes, called upon all governments to forbid critical, insulting or defamatory statements about religion, especially the Islamic faith. The proposal failed to earn sufficient votes in the UN General Assembly to become a binding resolution, and it will not be on the agenda at the next conference, slated for Geneva in April.

Like more than a few parents of children on the spectrum, it often seems that I have spent a significant portion of the years since my son's birth in the car and, indeed, the car in motion. When Charlie was younger, driving him around and around often seemed the only way to soothe him to sleep (though he was almost 99% proof positive guaranteed to wake up once the car stopped or we lifted him out of his car seat). Maybe because we were living in the midwest when Charlie was a baby and toddler and we had a hankering to come back East, to see friends and family and to visit the ocean: The three of us have always enjoyed road trips, whether in our old &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/bye-green-car/"&gt;green car&lt;/a&gt; or in a rental car with that rental car smell, or in our current beloved over 104,000 miles black car (and it's not quite four years old.....).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess that must have been one reason why &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; I more than enjoyed (yes, that is the word) the many long rides through the Peloponnese and up into the northern-er part of Greece, in a bus the color of Pepto Bismo and on some tiny windy roads high up in the mountains featuring numerous hairpin turns one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat behind the bus driver, to get the best view possible of the road. The road signs were written in Greek and transliterated into English. I read both and as I was reading signs above what clearly were body shops and household appliance stores, it occurred to me that I'd never read Greek in anything but a book, and a book by an ancient author, and here I was reading street signs and billboards. (Including one that read ORAMA, leading a few students to ask if that was a reference to the US President, but no----ORAMA means "vision").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had gotten into Athens on a bright Saturday morning and, though most of us had barely slept on the flight over, we all pretty much left our bags at the hotel and headed into the city. One group immediately rushed to scale the Acropolis and another headed into the Plaka, the "old city" of Athens---a tourist area oozing souvenir shops and restaurants proffering gyros and souvlaki. By Sunday morning, and through Wednesday, we were boarding the bus around 8.30am every morning and driving off to a new site.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3386145939/" title="Here once was by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3386145939_f232c8ed8b_m.jpg" height="180" alt="Here once was" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We drove from Athens to Mycenae, home to Agamemnon and Klytemnestra in the myths, on Sunday, and then onto Olympia, where the first Olympic Games were held. After seeing the ancient site on Monday, we drove northwards across the &lt;a href="http://www.gefyra.gr/en/index.php"&gt;Rion-Antiorion Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and up into the mountains to Delphi. Our hotel was right on the side of the mountain and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3360560072/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; was the view from my hotel room. We started Tuesday visiting the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3378107734/"&gt;sanctuary and ruins at Delphi&lt;/a&gt; and then drove through the mountains and past &lt;a href="http://www.arahova.gr/arachova_engl.htm"&gt;Arachova&lt;/a&gt;, now known for its skiing. We proceeded through Thessaly and up to the small city of Meteora in Kalambaka, where monasteries have been built atop rock formations that look out of Dr. Seuss. Wednesday started with us visiting a monastery and a convent (both built atop those rocks) and then driving back to Athens in rain that became a deluge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of time on the road and in a vehicle. Some students played the movie game (I listened and learned how spotty my movie knowledge is, but the last time Jim and I went to the movies together it was to see &lt;em&gt;Mystic River&lt;/em&gt;); others dozed, listened to music. I wrote down the names of many of the towns we drove through and followed our course on a map, read more signs, searched for an answer for a movie game question, took photos. Maybe it was a bit too much bus-time for some of our group; for me and some others, it was a way to take in a lot of sights and see a lot of the country, and to put up our feet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3386958386/" title="Do you see the monastery? by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/3386958386_97c2022a9d_m.jpg" height="180" alt="Do you see the monastery?" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jim jokes that I always fall asleep when he's driving and that's at least semi-true (and I guess I just provided something of an answer to a question I've been asked over the years, namely, "when do I sleep?"). I stayed awake in Greece as everything was new and I don't know if I'll ever see it again, plus there was a lot I wanted to be attentive to----riding in a tour bus in Greece with 15 students isn't the same as sitting beside Jim with Charlie perched in the back seat, making our rounds through Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of us went on yet another of our road trips yesterday. We drove almost two hours to see a new neurologist in South Jersey (in other words, it was a longer trip to see this neuro within New Jersey---we usually see a neurologist who's in Pennsylvania and it takes less time). As we drove down the Turnpike, Charlie's eyes under his two hoods fixed steadily on the passing scenery of billsboards with Regis and Kelly smiling beside the TD bank logo and gargantuan warehouses with lines of truck bays, Jim talked about how the containers get unloaded from the ships in the port and then driven all the way down to South Jersey where there's more space, and I noted how the scale of everything back here in the US has been overwhelming me ever since being in Greece, and we saw a sign that said "Marlton" and Jim started reminiscing about his South Jersey friends from college and especially good old Mike who's gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I woke up, we were in Camden County amid tract homes and sprawling suburban malls, and Jim was reading off the names of the street signs. "We're almost there to see the new doctor," I said, turning my head back towards Charlie, and then I looked out to read the signs along with Jim too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238044145208"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/road_trips">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/766ade8f43946a16</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Road Trips</title><published>2009-03-25T01:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T01:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/road_trips" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3386960344/" title="To Olympia by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3547/3386960344_1a7622aee8_m.jpg" height="180" alt="To Olympia" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"We're almost there to see the new doctor," I said, turning my head back towards Charlie, and then I looked out to read the signs along with Jim too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238043736744"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a9f60aae56b6c00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Coming Clean</title><published>2009-03-26T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/screencleaner.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Does a web site provide access to a program that will clean the inside of your computer screen?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238038144855"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-1366705653685892689">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3ad181e1ecc615b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Am I Tired of Slamming the Pope Yet?

Vernon, Ohio, school district resumed today.  For links to previous posts on the hearing &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/freshwater-day-9.html" rel=""&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testimony today came from Jeff Maley, former Superintendent of the Mt. Vernon City Schools, and Lori Miller, currently a middle school math teacher and formerly a middle school science teacher.  Both were called by R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, who is presenting Freshwater’s case to not be terminated.  The Board’s case was presented in earlier sessions of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Maley Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Maley was in the Mt. Vernon School System for approximately 20 years as an administrator, including around 8 years as superintendent.  His son, now 25, was in Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science class.  Maley was a history teacher before moving into administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In direct examination Hamilton pressed on the scanty documentation of past problems with Freshwater’s behavior.  Maley described the three incidents that he recalled where an issue with Freshwater’s teaching came to his attention.  The first was in the early 2000s when a parent complained about the use of inappropriate ID/creationist materials in class.  Maley said that was resolved with the then-Principal, Mr. Koons, speaking to Freshwater about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was in 2003 when Freshwater offered a “teach the controversy” approach for adoption in the science curriculum.  Freshwater first made the proposal acting as a teacher to the Curriculum Council, a group of teachers and administrators charged with evaluating curriculum proposals.  The Council rejected the proposal, and Freshwater then brought it to the Board of Education in his role as parent of children in the schools.  After several months of meetings and comments from teachers, administrators, the public, and Maley, the Board rejected both Freshwater’s original proposal and a weaker proposal moved by one Board member.  Maley said he considered that incident to have been resolved by the Board’s action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third was in 2006 and again concerned the use of inappropriate handouts.  On this occasion Maley wrote a formal letter to Freshwater instructing him not to use unsourced material because being unsourced it could not be properly evaluated regarding whether it was appropriate for use.  Maley’s letter also told Freshwater that the material he’d used had not passed scientific review and wasn’t scientifically accepted.  This last was on advice from the chairman of the high school science department, Dick Cunningham, and Charles Adkins, another science teacher.  Their memo to Maley reporting their evaluation mentioned both the lack of sourcing, the lack of scientific merit, and the fact that the material did not meet the content standards.  Maley said he left the latter point out of his letter to Freshwater because the material couldn’t be sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to the lack of sourcing of the material, Maley said, “At the very best the source was left off; at the very worst the source was taken off.”  He would not speculate on which he thought was the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this incident of interest because in making his 2003 proposal to the Board of Education Freshwater also used unsourced material, that time the infamous “Ten Questions to Ask Your Biology Teacher About Evolution.”  The copies Freshwater handed out at the Board meeting also contained no source identification, though &lt;a href="http://www.iconsofevolution.com/tools/questions.php3" rel="external "&gt;it exists on the Web&lt;/a&gt; in exactly the form Freshwater’s handout had but with a source plainly visible on the top of the Web page.  It’s Jonathan Wells’ &lt;em&gt;Icons of Evolution&lt;/em&gt; site.  Recall that Wells’ book was in Freshwater’s room when it was inspected by the independent investigators in April, 2008.  Using material whose source isn’t given or is concealed appears to be a pattern.  Recall also that Freshwater couldn’t remember where or from whom he got the “Watchmaker” video that testimony showed he had shown in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he had conversations with Board members about Freshwater, Maley replied that he had about the proposal Freshwater brought to the Board.  Maley recommended against adoption – I was at that meeting and Maley made a strong public statement opposing adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Maley’s letter, Freshwater sent a reply to Maley.  The reply included a lesson plan for the week of April 3-8, 2006, in which Freshwater identified the state standards and benchmarks the material supposedly addressed.  I got a brief look at that lesson plan.  The April 3 entry referred to “irreducible complexity” and “specified complexity,” both of which have meaning only in the context of intelligent design creationism.  The Wednesday lesson plan entry, April 5, had reference to “peppered moths,” with no elaboration.  That’s another creationist favorite, is featured in Wells’ book, and is #6 on the “Ten Questions” list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maley said he did not recall receiving that letter from Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked again if his only problem was that the material couldn’t be sourced, Maley replied “That’s a huge problem.”  Bits and pieces of the handout were found in allaboutgod.com, but Freshwater denied having been to that site.  Maley said he did not speculate on whether that was true or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to several questions Maley testified that while teachers have considerable freedom in using supplemental materials, that freedom was not unlimited and materials had to support the relevant curriculum content standards.  If teachers had questions about some materials they could ask their principal or the Curriculum Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to another question Maley testified that a science teacher should be aware whether students’ questions about evolution are genuine scientific issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked Maley if he had a report of a teacher burning a cross on a student’s arm, would he take the teacher out of the classroom.  Maley replied he didn’t know, that it would depend on the results of an investigation of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether a teacher’s supervisor should be aware of things like using Tesla coils to shock students, Maley replied that the teacher is responsible for his acts in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maley was shown the pictures of Zachary Dennis’ arm with the red marks in the shape of a cross.  In response to questions, Maley testified that if he were told by a parent that a teacher had made the marks with an electrostatic device he would be very concerned, would interview the parents, and would probably call Children’s Services, since it’s required of teachers and administrators (among others) by Ohio law in instances where child abuse is suspected.  Maley testified that he leans more toward the liberal end when it comes to reporting such incidents, preferring to report when in doubt rather than not report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether his concern would be exacerbated by knowing the teacher was Freshwater, Maley replied “No.”  Asked if he would take pictures of the injury, he replied that he probably would have photos taken.  Asked if he would investigate if he thought the pictures were not authentic, Maley replied that it would depend on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAmilton asked if Maley had heard complaints about religion in Freshwater’s classroom.  Maley said he had heard second hand reports and knew that former Principal Koons had spoken to Freshwater about it.  Maley assumed it had been handled at the building level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maley testified that he knew Freshwater was “faithful,” saying Freshwater sometimes wore a religious ring, bowed his head before eating, and so on, all signs MAley took to indicate Freshwater’s religious faith.  Asked if he had ever seen Freshwater “impose” his religion on others, Maley replied he had not seen that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if he had heard any complaints about religion in the school.  Maley replied that at one time FCA members were putting crosses on their lockers to advertise their membership, and he instructed that they couldn’t do so.  They could identify themselves as FCA members but couldn’t use religious symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the poster of George W. Bush, Colin Powell, and the rest of Bush’s cabinet in prayer with the Bible verse from James, Maley said it was not appropriate in a classroom.  He also testified that having Bible verses posted was not appropriate because “It would be advocating religion.”  Maley, a former history teacher, said, “If I put something up in my classroom it’s there to influence students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maley testified that if he knew of a Bible on a teacher’s desk he would ask that it be removed.  He said he would also ask that a Koran be removed from a Muslim teacher’s desk.  Asked what he would do if a teacher told him the Bible was his inspiration, Maley replied “I’d tell him to put it in his briefcase and be inspired.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton then returned to a theme he’s visited repeatedly, asking Maley if by looking at it on a desk, one could tell Freshwater’s Bible is a religious item.  Maley said its title is “The Living Bible.”  Hamilton wandered off into a thicket of semantics about the metaphoric use of “bible” – could it refer to a “golf bible” or a “mechanic’s bible.”  Maley pointed out the differences in meaning in the usages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton referred to the Board of Education’s policy on religion in the schools, and asked if having a Bible on a teacher’s desk is “a display of a religious character,” in the words of the policy.  Maley replied that it is.  Asked who is responsible for seeing to it that Bibles are removed from desks, Maley replied that it was the Principal’s responsibility to the extent of his knowledge of their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked who is responsible for interpreting the Board’s policy on religious materials in schools, Maley replied “All of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that last answer interesting because a substantial part of Freshwater’s defense is that no one ever told him his religious displays weren’t appropriate,  For more on that, see Lori Miller’s testimony below.  She had no idea that a teacher praying over students at school lunch or in the hall wasn’t appropriate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if a student asked a question about Easter could a teacher answer.  Maley replied that he could, but that the answer cannot advocate a particular religious view.  He said a teacher’s answer should be limited and that students should be advised to go to their parents with religious questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton asked if a teacher should teach “both sides” of the evolution issue. Maley replied that “You have to stick with the science.”  Asked if a teacher could talk about the other side if it isn’t science, Maley replied “Not for very long.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton read Maley’s comments recorded in the independent investigator’s notes that Maley  thought Freshwater could not teach evolution objectively because of his religious beliefs.  Asked the basis for that view, Maley identified interactions with Freshwater during the time of his proposal to the Board of Education in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to a question, Maley testified that he would not be surprised to hear that Freshwater’s students did well on the Ohio Achievement Test (which they did) because Maley thinks Freshwater is probably very good at transmitting information to students.  (I actually think this too – it’s just in the area of what creationists call “origins science” that Freshwater has a serious problem.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked why he had entertained the thought of transferring Freshwater to a different class/subject matter, as reported in the investigator’s notes, Maley replied that he felt that Freshwater was too conflicted about teaching science, and in the wake of the rejection of the 2003 proposal to the board Maley was seeking a way to reduce that conflict for Freshwater.  Dean Narcisco, reporter for the Columbus Dispatch, caught the whole quotation in &lt;a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/03/25/fresh26.html?sid=101" rel="external "&gt;his story today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that John, Mr. Freshwater, has a strong difficulty resolving his philosophical difficulties with the scientific community,” Maley said. “I respect that struggle, by the way. He is very fervent about the issue of evolution being incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the two “Distinguished Teacher Awards” Freshwater had received, Maley said he started the program in the early 1990s when he was interim superintendent for a while as a way to recognize significant accomplishments in all sorts of activities.  He said that there were no criteria for making the award except being nominated, and that he didn’t know who the awardees would be until the banquet at which they were given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, asked about the old saying “If it wasn’t documented it didn’t happen” Maley said he disagreed, and that “events evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the end of direct and there was no cross examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Miller Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lori Miller is a middle school science and math teacher – she used to teach science and now teaches 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade math.  Her daughter had Freshwater in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science some unmentioned time ago.  She is also (I think) a member of Freshwater’s Assemblies of God congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the shocker of the day: Miller testified that after the Freshwater issue arose last year, she began surreptitiously taping meetings she had with administrators.  (“Surreptitiously” here means the taping was done without the knowledge or permission of the other participants in meetings.)  She said she did it in order to assure herself that she understood clearly what she was to do and understand.  We didn’t learn about the taping until part way through her testimony, so there’s more on this below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, Miller is a co-religionist and strong supporter of Freshwater.  She said she supports and encourages him.  She testified that she hadn’t read all of the independent investigator’s report because it sickened and disgusted her.  She said that she did all the things Freshwater was being disciplined for – she had a Bible and four devotional books (exhibited to the hearing) on her classroom desk, used a Tesla coil to shock students when she taught science, was an FCA faculty monitor, and had religious materials displayed in her classroom, but she wasn’t being disciplined.  She named four teachers who have Bibles on their desks in addition to Freshwater.  She said she thought Freshwater was being specifically targeted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Displaying a picture of her desk, she showed that the Bible and devotional books were plainly visible, piled on a corner of the desk.  She described religious materials displayed on one quadrant of her classroom bulletin board.  They included a cross given to her by a student (roughly 8” high by 5” wide), a “Faith” card, and notes from her husband with Bible verses on them.  She had removed those items on instructions from Bill White, middle school Principal, and Superintendent Short before the start of the 2008-2009 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her testimony she also said that another middle school teacher, Wes Elifritz, a health teacher, had more elaborate religious materials than hers displayed in his room and had not been requested to remove them.  She repeated that several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller testified that after she spoke publicly at the August 4, 2004, Board of Education meeting, telling the Board that she had used the Tesla coil and had other similarities to Freshwater, she was called to a meeting with Superintendent Short, Bill White (middle school Principal), and Brad Ritchie (middle school assistant Principal).  She was advised to bring a union representative with her, and there were in fact two reps from the union present.  That meeting was on August 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller taped that meeting, using a small recorder in her open purse.  Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, attempted to play the core portion of the tape for the hearing, but his speakers were so bad that the audio was incomprehensible.  So playing the tape was called off (rats!) and Hamilton questioned Miller about the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller testified that there were a couple of topics discussed at the meeting.  First there was an issue with her continuing contract and a delay in her recertification.  That was apparently due to her having submitted the necessary materials to the State DOE late.  Apparently in this connection, Superintendent Short raised a question about Miller having taken a sick day rather than a personal day for a court appearance in September 2007, nearly a year earlier but not mentioned until this meeting.  Short told her he didn’t want to take her out of the classroom.  Her certification was apparently resolved later.  (I use “apparently” here because there were elliptical references to “a court case” and “charges were dropped” and the like, and I don’t know the backstory.  Yet.)  Miller said that Short gave her two weeks to get a physician’s excuse for the day, but he didn’t follow up and she didn’t, either.  She thought it was bizarre that the matter was brought up nearly a year after it occurred and in the context of the meeting in which it was raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some apparently brief discussion of her public remarks to the BoE in early August, though there was little direct testimony about that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main topic of the meeting was the display of religious items in her classroom and the necessity to remove them.  She testified that despite asking, she never got a clear idea of what a “display” was, and she asked specifically whether it included her Bible on her desk.  She testified that she told Short that she wouldn’t take it off her desk, and Short told her that he wasn’t asking her to remove the Bible, but the Board might require it and then she could file a grievance.  Hamilton asked if she knew whether Freshwater had ever been advised that he could file a grievance (she had accompanied him to one meeting with Bill White), and she said he had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In extended testimony she showed pictures of the religious materials displayed in Wes Elifritz’s room, including several verses from Psalms 37, a poster on memorizing the 10 Commandments complete with mnemonic advice, a poem about Christians and Christ, and the lyrics of the chorus of a “praise and worship song.”  She said as far as she knew the display was still there.  When asked, she said the items were grouped together for a purpose, a religious display.  Also when asked if one had no exposure to Christianity would one know it’s a religious display, she replied “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she asked Superintendent Short why she had to take her “less obvious” materials down when Wes Elifritz didn’t have to take his down.  She said she didn’t get a clear answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller testified that she had never had any instruction on the First Amendment Separation Clause.  Asked if she had encouraged students at school to embrace Christianity before the Freshwater affair began last year, she readily responded that she had done so.  She gave examples in an excited voice.  She had prayed over students in the halls and lunchroom, had counseled them to seek Christ, and so on.  She said, “I honestly didn’t think that was wrong.”  She was very enthusiastic in voice and manner about her proselytizing in the public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questioned about FCA, she said that she had been a monitor up until this last year, when FCA has not been meeting.  She, Wes Elifritz, and another teacher whose name I missed have had several meetings this year with administrators, seeking a way to have FCA meet so that teachers could take a more active role, praying with the students and singing with them, rather than being passive monitors. She said “We wanted to be part of it rather than just stand by.  We wanted to pray with the kids and be involved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that several parents had written to her at the end of the school year thanking her for being a Christian in a public school.  She testified that she never thought that sharing her Christian faith with students in the school was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, this woman sees the public middle school as a missionary field for fundamentalist Christian teachers – &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; teachers.  In an earlier post I remarked that Freshwater appeared to be running his own little parochial school embedded in the public schools.  He’s not the only one.  There’s a group of mutually supporting Christian fundamentalists treating the public schools in Mt. Vernon as a venue to proselytize and convert students in (at least!) the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grades.  This matter is going well beyond just Freshwater.  There are a fair number of parents here who would be a whole lot less than enthused about having their children in a Fellowship of Christian Athletes in which the regular and dominant adult/teacher presence was actively involved fundamentalist proselytizers and missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she is aware of the Board’s “Controversial Issues” policy, she responded that she is not.  Asked if she is aware of the Board’s policy on religious issues, she responded that she is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the pictures of the injury to Zachary Dennis’ arm, Miller testified that she had never seen that produced by a Tesla coil when she used it in science class in the 1990s.  She thought it was either “self induced or from something else.”  She testified if she saw an injury like that on a student it would have to be reported to Children’s Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about former middle school Principal Koons, Miller testified that he was a strong leader and that he made things clear.  He had once admonished her not to wear an FCA t-shirt and to not play music of “praise and worship” in the school.  She testified that he told her that he had strong faith and that his admonishment was not personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about him, she testified that Freshwater “has an absolute God-given talent for teaching kids.”  She described how Freshwater is outside his classroom door just before each class, and greets each student as he or she enters.  She testified that when she was teaching 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science, at the beginning of each year she would meet with Freshwater and he would ask her about every kid to find out what ‘hooks’ that student, what would draw the student into participation and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if a teacher should point out when a text was wrong, she replied yes.  Had she ever done that?  Yes, she said, once the science text had the weight of an ostrich egg wrong.  And occasionally there are math errors in her math texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if teachers could teach beyond the standards, Miller replied that they could and that she was doing so, currently using an 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade math book for a class of advanced 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori Miller Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross examination was fairly brief, and will be continued tomorrow after David Millstone, the Board’s attorney, has had an opportunity to listen to the audio file of Lori Miller’s recording of the meeting described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked Miller if her use of the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade text is part of a curricular program for advanced 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students.  She replied that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked if Miller had ever observed Freshwater teaching.  She said she had.  Asked for how long, she replied “Just moments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked if she had asked anyone if she could tape the meetings.  She replied she had not.  Did she tape without informing anyone?  She replied she had not informed people she was taping, and that the recorder was in her open purse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton objected at this stage, arguing that the questions gave the impression that the taping was illegal when in fact under Ohio law there’s no requirement for other parties to be informed they’re being taped.  Millstone ended that line of questioning, having made his point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millstone asked about the state DOE’s hold on her teaching certificate, and again there were some elliptical comments about the state needing to get some additional material to process her application, and “there were some charges that had not been dropped and the state had to wait for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if she still prayed with students in school, she said she does not, and has not done so since the Freshwater affair began last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She testified that she last used in the Tesla coil on students in 2000, the last time she taught science.  She described her use as just touching students’ arms with the arc momentarily, just “a fraction of a second if that.”  Students also held hands and she shocked one end of the chain so students could see the electricity was conducted to the last student in the chain.  She said that she was instructed in the use of the Tesla coil by Jeff George, a now-retired science teacher, and that “if veteran teachers were using it, it was O.K. for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She repeated that she and Wes Elifritz were seeking ways they could become more actively involved in FCA meetings.  One strange proposal was to have a “normal” FAC meeting with teachers passively monitoring from 2:30 p.m. (end of students’ day) and 3:00 p.m. (end of teachers’ contract day), and then an active involvement of teachers from 3:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. after the teachers’ contract day had ended; this, of course, on school property.  She said they had also thought about renting space at the school out of school hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hearing was recessed at this point and will resume tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I decide to re-post it today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have been thinking and reading about the current state and potential future of journalism, including science journalism, and writing (still in my head) a post about it. So, I am forcing myself to go through my evolution of thinking about the topic, digging through my categories on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/media/" title=""&gt;Media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/science_reporting/" title=""&gt;Science Reporting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/blogging/" title=""&gt;Blogging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/open_science/" title=""&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, onlin &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/techology/" title=""&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;, etc. and this essay was the first time I ever wrote on anything related to this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me, first, how my writing got better over the years. Then, it is interesting to see where I was prophetic, where I was over-optimistic, and where I was just plain wrong. Then I can start thinking about the way my ideas have evolved over time and what precipitated that evolution.  I hope you also find it thought-provoking (especially the new readers) - under the fold:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/smoke_signals_blogs_and_the_fu_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/smoke_signals_blogs_and_the_fu_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/enRhTrA4H0U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238027352506"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/25/the-c-variant/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cffb81435efda18a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Computing"/><category term="Miscellany"/><title type="html">The C Variant</title><published>2009-03-26T00:28:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T00:28:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/25/the-c-variant/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not to be a harbinger of doom, but this one sounds bad.  There are some 6-15 million computers out there running Windows which are infected with a computer virus, dubbed Conficker C.  The recent &lt;a href="http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/addendumC/index.html"&gt;report by SRI&lt;/a&gt; makes for some chilling reading.  On April 1 (that is, next Wednesday!) the virus is set to…well…do something.  It’s not clear what, but with so many millions of computers will do it.  The report concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present an analysis of Conficker Variant C, which emerged on the Internet at roughly 6 p.m. (PST) on 4 March 2009.  This variant incorporates significant new functionality, including a new domain generation algorithm and a new peer-to-peer file sharing service.   Absent from our discussion has been any reference to the well-known attack propagation vectors (RCP buffer overflow, USB, and NetBios Scans) that have allowed C’s predecessors to saturate so much of the Internet.  Although not present in C, these attack propagation services are but one peer upload away from any C infected host, and may appear at any time.   C is, in fact, a robust and secure distribution utility for distributing malicious content and binaries to millions of computers across the Internet.   This utility incorporates a potent arsenal of methods to defend itself from security products, updates, and diagnosis tools.  It further demonstrates the rapid development pace at which Conficker’s authors are maintaining their current foothold on a large number of Internet-connected hosts.  Further, if organized into a coordinated offensive weapon, this multimillion-node botnet poses a serious and dire threat to the Internet.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes! Whoever wrote this thing is not a very nice person…or persons.  The C variant apparently managed to upgrade itself over the network, and disables security anti-virus software.  If I were you (and I am apparently not because I use only OS X and Unix) I would update my antivirus software every day and scan my machine.  And leave it off next Wednesday if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pass the word…&lt;/p&gt;

(Can your believe this. Totally free love backed up with five-million dollars! I never thought I was worth that to anybody. Especially by an old man worth hundreds of billions who is facing death soon (Sorry, I did not mean it the way it came out.)&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have not met this wonderful man, but I personally do know he has on file very reliable legal documents and that he has put the five-million dollar fund in twenty-five different banks to make sure the principle is FDIC insured. And, at the time of his death, all the principle and interest are all mine to use as I see fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a totally free gift of love by a person I’ve never met (Can you believe it!). The ONLY thing that he asks is that I show my love to him in return for this wonderful gift by doing simple 3 things which will cost me nothing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. He will want me to keep his reputation highly respected and defend it from anyone putting him down or being disrespectful of him. Trust is a major factor and part of his reputation, thus questioning this trust will reflect poorly on him and me. (I can do a lot of trusting for five-million dollars and who would not?! Buddy, I’m not stupid!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. Since he wants to remain highly respected; it only follows that he will want me to live a life that reflects his own morals and ethics. (Hey, after all it takes one to know one! Want proof: How about five–million dollars worth of proof! Put that in your pipe and smoke it!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. He will want me to tell other people that they too can have this free gift of love and money if they simply will likewise do A and B above and help share his reputation and this good news of personal love and wealth with anyone else who will accept it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I do know the money is in the bank. I personally do know this man that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars loves me. (&lt;strong&gt;I don’t have to prove this to you or anyone else for that matter&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You want to know something else: I’m sure I love him too. Listen, why would I not since he has proven this just by offering me the five-million dollars as proof that he loves me even more than my own family has or anyone I’ve ever met in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What to know one more thing? I’ve thought about this wonderful offer and love. I’ve decide to accept it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, just this consolation of love and money has already taken so much pressure and the burden of life off my back; even more than I can began to tell you about it! Talk about reality, man I’m now experiencing it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am now inviting you to have a real loving dad on this earth and five-million dollars too simply by doing something in life that will cost you nothing. (You ready know deep down in your heart you are unhappy with how life has treated you.) Please let me tell him you have found the truth in this life by just letting me tell him you will do A, B, and C above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you accept this great humanitarian’s gift of love backed up with money. Both he and I would love the see more millionaires with smiles on their faces, moral and ethics guiding their lives and love in their hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, won’t you throw off this burdensome world and aimless life for a real dad that not only loves you, but proves it with millions of dollars?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you and I hope everyone can be a happy multi-millionaire like me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People, trust is free. Won’t you try it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A man who now has a REAL DAD and your next multi-millionaire to be:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;$Harry$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1023566004208278981?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

On and on the email went. By the end, I had no idea how I would politely respond to the ridiculous carnage of autism-myths staring back at me in feckless successive rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, did I even want to begin wacking such overgrown weeds? After all, my relative had only meant to impress me with her new found knowledge. She was guilty of nothing but trying to make a connection. Unfortunately, her new views, and those of her acquaintance, were magnificently erroneous to say the least. Where had she gone wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I diplomatically began rearranging, correcting, and piecing together a new story of autism. Most of all, I was on a mission to empower this relative of mine to seek the truth for herself. I wanted to craft her a key to a car that she would need to be in control of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I composed the return email, my thoughts likened learning about autism to shopping for a home loan. Buying a house is a big deal--for most of us anyway. Though some people jump at the first loan offer, a large percentage of people study up and shop around. We throw on caps of wisdom, become discerning, and are on the lookout for any loopholes that could cause potentially agonizing losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we just accept any old information, from any old source, about things we may not know as much about such as autism, deafness, or quantum physics? Is it because we are easily overwhelmed? Is there just too much information to sort through?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I have somewhat of a leg up seeing as to how autism is one of my special interests. But I am in a perpetual state of learning, pondering, and redefining when it comes to autism. Even more so, I like to play devil's advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I was a guest speaker at an autism conference for parents of autistic children. Several parents asked me for my advice on how to go about learning more about autism. They were especially interested in the perspectives of other autistic adults, which made me beam, but they were also hungry for valid information about autism in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few snippets of advice I offered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were vehemently determined to run for President of the United States--or whatever country have you--and you were appointed to speak on something you knew little about, would you get up in front of your audience and spew forth the information your neighbor down the street gave you without a second thought?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be well-informed, you've got to drive your own car. Go shopping, try different things, and keep an open mind. Last but not least, take what you need and leave the rest. We're not all going to agree. After all, this is earth and we are only human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When learning about autism, it is best to first become a student. The teaching part can come later. Study both what you agree with and what you don't. Be well-rounded and get those gears turning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flyingdutchphotos/843854633/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/843854633_eed5a43aea.jpg?v=0" width="300" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Change.org's Kristina Chew and Dora Raymaker have provided some fabulous suggestions for reading materials. I also encourage checking out local libraries and favorite bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider attending conferences such as Autreat by &lt;a href="http://www.autreat.com/"&gt;Autism Network International&lt;/a&gt;, if feasible, and most importantly, pay attention to what autistic individuals--of any age--have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a fan of reading the latest research findings, a good way to deepen your understanding of proposed research is to be a discerning critic. Check out this link:&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous articles about autism research in neuroscience, genetics, and other fields are regularly published. Some of them are presented in press releases and news articles, often with some indication of how the research might contribute to the creation of new treatments (such as medications) for those with autism. I turn to these studies principally to learn a bit more about how things are for Charlie; about why some of his struggles seem to arise "out of the blue" and for reasons that aren't immediately explainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/"&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; has recently published a &lt;a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/appi.ajp.2008.07101681v1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; about autism and hyperactivity and overarousal in the &lt;a href="http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/med532/amygdala.htm"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, an almond-shaped structure of the human brain that is linked with a person's mental and emotional states. In studying 19 individuals with autism and 20 adults who were not on the spectrum, researchers from the University of Washington found that, when looking at a series of human faces, "..... brain activation in adults with autism remains elevated long after similar brain regions of typically developed adults have stopped being activated," as noted in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090319132956.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;. Further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is popularly associated with the "fight-or-flight response" in dangerous situations. But it has other functions, including identifying faces and situations and evaluating social information such as emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research shows that brain activation in adults with autism remains elevated long after similar brain regions of typically developed adults have stopped being activated when exposed to a series of pictures of human faces. A decrease in activation over time to the same type of information is called neural habituation and is connected with learning, according to Natalia Kleinhans, lead author of the new study and a UW research assistant professor of radiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.............................&lt;br&gt;
"If you consider that habituation reflects learning in as simple a task as looking at a face, slowness to habituate in people with autism may contribute even more markedly to difficulty with more complex social interactions and social cognition. If the brain is not reacting typically to a static face with a neutral expression, you can imagine how difficult it may be for someone with autism to pick up more subtle social cues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's this noting of "hyperarousal" and overactivation in response to "socially relevant stimuli" that draws my attention. Sometimes it seems that there are only extremes to things with Charlie. One moment no one could be happier, more excited, jumping up and down and all huge smiles; the next, he might be down on the ground wailing and miserable. Sometimes we use the word "mood swings" to explain these, but I've wondered if something else might be afoot----that there's some &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autisms-cause-at-the-synapse/"&gt;connections&lt;/a&gt; that aren't happening, that are taking too long too happen, that happen too suddenly and all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually are taking Charlie to a different neurologist today. His current &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doctor_day"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt;----whom we have seen for so long and with whom all three of us have a good rapport----is wonderful. But we've felt that we have to keep looking into everything for Charlie and, in particular, to look more closely at his medications and the potential effects of the changes brought with adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I worked my way through the 17-page new patient form and dug out old reports, behavior intervention plans, and IEPs and reviewed them: A lot of paperwork on this kid, that's for sure and yet how little we still know and seek to learn in whatever ways possible---you never can stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238016424072"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4206">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a4884c6242352e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education and Legal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="texas" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Texas"/><category term="education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="education"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="evolution"/><category term="standards" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="standards"/><title type="html">Scientists to Texas BOE: Teach Evolution Right!</title><published>2009-03-25T20:57:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-26T02:31:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/scientists-to-t.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a letter from over 50 scientific societies urging the Texas Board of Education to promote the modern science education curriculum developed by its own committees of educational and scientific experts.  Right now the board is considering replacing the curriculum developed by its experts with one developed by anti-science culture warriors.  The quack in charge of the process recently &lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/03/25/0325mcleroy_edit.html" rel="external "&gt;advocated lying to Texas students&lt;/a&gt; about evolution and has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/03/mcelroy_endorses_idiotic_anti-.php" rel="external "&gt;endorsed a book&lt;/a&gt; that “calls Christians who accept evolution ‘morons’ and parents that teach their children evolution ‘monsters.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Texas is one of the two largest textbook markets, any decision they make to promote quackery is likely to adversely affect other states and the capacity of our nation to be scientifically competitive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Message to the Texas State Board of Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The undersigned scientific and educational societies call on the Texas State Board of Education to support accurate science education for all students by adopting the science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills or TEKS) as recommended to you by the scientists and educators on your writing committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution is the foundation of modern biology, and is also crucial in fields as diverse as agriculture, computer science, engineering, geology, and medicine. We oppose any efforts to undermine the teaching of biological evolution and related topics in the earth and space sciences, whether by misrepresenting those subjects, or by inaccurately and misleadingly describing them as controversial and in need of special scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its January 2009 meeting, the Texas Board of Education rightly rejected attempts to add language to the TEKS about “strengths and weaknesses” – used in past efforts to undermine the teaching of evolution in Texas. We urge the Board to stand firm in rejecting any such attempts to compromise the teaching of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its January 2009 meeting, the Board also adopted a series of amendments to the TEKS that misrepresent biological evolution and related topics in the earth and space sciences. We urge the Board to heed the advice of the scientific community and the experienced scientists and educators who drafted the TEKS: reject these and any other amendments which single out evolution for scrutiny beyond that applied to other scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adopting the TEKS crafted by your expert writing committees, the Board will serve the best educational interests of students in Texas’s public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously, is there anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet places a wealth of information right at our fingertips. It provides a means by which we can procure goods and services from all over the world. It allows us to keep track of all the people we hated in high school. It blesses us with fabulous pictures and videos of explicit sexual acts when we are unable to participate in those acts ourselves. It allows us to be a part of electronic lives of some kick ass Skepchicks. And it can get us &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, the Internet can apparently get us baked, stoned, fried, gooned, wigged, tweaked, goofed, and zoned. Basically, it can get us good and fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Internet, we can achieve the same mental states we can with drugs, only without all the pesky smoking, shooting, ingesting, or absorbing of any substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that is the concern of some parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou090324_mh_digital-drugs.6a9bb973.html"&gt;this news item&lt;/a&gt;. It details the controversy surrounding a website called &lt;a href="http://i-doser.com/"&gt;I-Doser.com&lt;/a&gt; that claims to be “the industry leader in binaural brainwave technology”. Basically I-Doser offers sounds — auditory tones — and claims that the tones, which they sell for five bucks a pop for download over the Internet, can affect mental states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And parents are worried that the tones can essentially duplicate any state that can be achieved through conventional drugs. They’re worried their kids can get high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are even several &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v21nz_h2c7c"&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; portraying the various types of high one can attain using I-Doser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things come to my mind that might explain this whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggestibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wishful thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outright scam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean if it were indeed possible to get blotto by downloading and listening to a sound, I wouldn’t have to worry about finishing this sentence. I’d be too high to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying being high is the state of mind we should strive for above all others. I’m just saying it can be a fun one. And the convenience of this type of delivery system would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don’t see anything that would make me think this type of greatness is available yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238015914979"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2568854922026581425">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00a3fa434510b460</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Old Tools</title><published>2009-03-25T21:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T21:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/old-tools_827.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2568854922026581425/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2568854922026581425" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238014578697"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/25/galileoscope-update/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ea91f7278e80e62</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="IYA"/><title type="html">Galileoscope update</title><published>2009-03-25T20:49:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T20:49:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/25/galileoscope-update/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting some mail from folks who are a little unhappy with the customer service when they’ve ordered &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/10/spread-the-joy-of-astronomy-with-a-galileoscope/"&gt;Galileoscopes&lt;/a&gt; — a big effort by IYA to get good but inexpensive telescopes into the hands of people across the globe. &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/news/updates/206/"&gt;The IYA just posted about this&lt;/a&gt;: basically, it’s being run by a very small group of volunteers who have been a bit (well, a lot) overwhelmed with the response.

I got up at 5 to make the long drive to the airport, only to discover that last night, after several days of rain, it had frozen. And snowed. Uh-oh, you say…at least in my usual caution I had given myself 5 hours to make a 3 hour drive, so I figured I&amp;#39;d have no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t bad; little traffic, the roads were icy, but I was taking my time and coping like a real Minnesotan. Then, as I was leaving lovely Glenwood, I saw a truck stopped to make a left turn way ahead — like 4 or 5 blocks ahead. So I touched the brakes to slow down a little more. So I tried to slow down a little more. So I tried very hard to slow down some more. Why isn&amp;#39;t this car slowing down at all? I still had plenty of room, so I started easing over to the right to miss the truck on the shoulder. I tried to ease over. Why isn&amp;#39;t the car turning? I was pumping the brakes and trying to shift over just a little bit, right up until the moment I crunched into the right rear corner of the truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d managed to slow it down enough that the truck was hardly damaged — a shattered tail light, and some dinged up body work. Unfortunately, my car smacked right into the wedge of the back corner directly at my left front wheel, and then slide forward to take out the driver&amp;#39;s side door. The wheels looked rather pigeon-toed afterwards, and I got a broken glass shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be pleased to know that I did not pray at any moment, but kept busy trying to get the vehicle under control. I did have plenty of time to curse at length and polysyllabically, saying cruel and hurtful things about the car's ancestry and the sexual and excretory habits of Minnesota weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have bounced back! My wife made an emergency run from work to pick me up and deliver me at the airport (I owe her big time now). I'm now waiting to catch a slightly later flight than I had planned, but I'll still make it to Michigan in time for my talk tonight. Have no fear, I will also look composed and &lt;i&gt;fabulous&lt;/i&gt; when I make my entrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/im_alive_never_fear.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_YKh4evmKYc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238006787358"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1268">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6645e0d9ffad772</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Usage advice"/><category term="Variation"/><title type="html">I have saw</title><published>2009-03-25T18:46:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T18:46:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1268" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1263"&gt;little while back&lt;/a&gt;, it was &lt;em&gt;had did, &lt;/em&gt;and other uses of &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, as the PSP (past participle) of the verb &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;. Non-standard PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; is a (partial) regularization of the system of verb forms in English; all regular verbs, and a great many irregular ones as well, have identical PST (past) and PSP: &lt;em&gt;jump&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;bought&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;bought&lt;/em&gt;. PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; improves the fully irregular pattern &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; to the somewhat more regular &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. As I pointed out in the earlier posting, the most common non-standard partial regularization for &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; is using &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; for the PST: &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; (similarly, &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; ~ &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t say in that posting — because I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it several times in the past — is that the regularization to PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; is in fact in the usual direction of verb regularization, which gives non-standard &lt;em&gt;I have took&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;went&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;rode&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;wrote&lt;/em&gt; etc. John Cowan has now reminded me of this, and also reminds me that H. L. Mencken, in &lt;em&gt;The American Language&lt;/em&gt;, refers to this regularization as a feature of &amp;quot;The Common Speech&amp;quot; — widespread, non-regional, non-standard American English. It now seems that the geographical and social distribution is more complex than that, that PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; has some association with Southern varieties and with AAVE (as several correspondents have suggested to me). And that &lt;em&gt;I have saw&lt;/em&gt; is out there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking into these things brought me to Richard Meade Bache's &lt;em&gt;Vulgarisms and Other Errors of Speech&lt;/em&gt; (which I've seen on-line in the 2nd edition (1869)), with its note on &lt;em&gt;I have saw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, on PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. I finally got to look at &lt;em&gt;DARE&lt;/em&gt;, where volume II under &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; (p. 94) says of the PSP that it's usually &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, but also, especially in the South and South Midlands, can be &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;. It also quotes a 1944 item in the &lt;em&gt;Publications of the American Dialect Society&lt;/em&gt; 2.8 that identifies PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; as Southern, found "over much of the South" and also "Negro", adding that it was "slightly less frequent than &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;." No observations on a possible difference between perfect and passive uses of PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, though &lt;em&gt;DARE&lt;/em&gt; cites examples of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on to Richard Meade Bache, who says (p. 81 in the 1869 ed.):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many persons who do not say "I &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;," and "I &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;," do say "I have &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Bache attributes to hypercorrection, triggered by corrections of PST &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; – though it seems gratuitous to appeal to hypercorrection, given the weight of the &amp;quot;Common Speech&amp;quot; pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two main reasons for this. The first is that the labs that they have experienced up to that point in undergraduate courses, though useful for introducing specific concepts, are a poor reflection of what real science is like. As such, it is important for them to experience original lab work, rather than simply following a pre-defined, "cook book" protocol with an expected result. Novel studies have no pre-defined sequence, no &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; expectation of the outcome, and in many cases no established methods in place for generating data. The second is that there are some important lessons that they need to learn about research, perhaps most importantly that whatever they try to do in the lab &lt;em&gt;will not work the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; time&lt;/em&gt;. The sooner they hit that wall -- and get around it -- the better. Nature does not give up her secrets easily, I sometimes say. &lt;p&gt;My  first experience with original research  came during my fourth year at McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada), though the story actually begins the year before. In the late 1990s, McMaster offered a course on "environmental physiology" which explored the various ways that animals had become adapted to different extreme environments and lifestyles. For example, how insects can survive in deserts or how deep diving mammals conserve oxygen. I was very interested in organism biology and wanted to take this course, but it was a senior course and was only offered in alternate years. This meant taking it in my 3rd year without the prerequisites, which the instructors agreed to let me (and my roommate) do, as long as we took the prerequisities after the fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were fewer than 10 people in the class (several of whom were graduate students) as it had a reputation for being very intense, with long labs on Friday evenings. Because of the small class size, we came to know the professors rather well, and I naturally asked them to supervise my undergraduate thesis project the following year. Specifically, I worked with Dr. Chris Wood, who is a very well regarded fish physiologist. Most of the work in his lab at the time had to so with metal toxicity, waste excretion, and so on, but one area struck me as particularly interesting -- it turned out that an earlier study had suggested that fish who grew the most rapidly did not swim well. Being interested in evolution and organism biology, the notion of a trade-off between growth and swimming seemed like a very interesting issue to explore. I proposed a project that would look at this possible trade-off between growth and swimming, but also would include a component of feeding competition and social hierarchy (Who gets the most food? Who grows fastest? Do dominant fish swim worse than subordinate fish?).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were, of course, numerous obstacles to overcome. How could I identify individual fish? How could I measure dominance rank and feeding? How should swimming performance be assessed? What size of fish should be used? And so on. After much trial and error, I settled on a system for identifying fish using a coded system of ink dots on the skin which were made using an injector that was once used to inject anaesthetic into the gums of dental patients. &lt;strong&gt; Lesson 1: Be prepared to be creative in terms of what counts as a scientific apparatus.  &lt;/strong&gt;(Dr. Wood once published a study conducted in Kenya which described the fish as being kept in "amber Tusker chambers" -- Tusker being the local beer).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGBQ-SAAI/AAAAAAAAApc/4U9Ha_wGNjQ/s1600-h/Fish7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:350px;height:285px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGBQ-SAAI/AAAAAAAAApc/4U9Ha_wGNjQ/s400/Fish7.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure from my undergraduate thesis indicating the identification&lt;br&gt;method I developed. Pretty decent for Windows Paint, if I may say so myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growth rate was relatively straightforward in principle: weigh and measure the lengths of the fish at regular intervals. Fortunately, someone else in the lab had constructed a "fish measuring tube", which was a transparent plastic half-cylinder with a ruler under it, on a slant with drain holes at the bottom. Worked a treat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGOOQGtfI/AAAAAAAAApk/ffYejU82PcU/s1600-h/Fish1x.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:350px;height:375px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGOOQGtfI/AAAAAAAAApk/ffYejU82PcU/s400/Fish1x.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some dude weighing a fish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swimming performance was assessed using a huge swim tunnel that had been built years before, but which was modified so I could reach in and get the fish to keep swimming once they had become stuck against the grating at the end of the swim section. I measured both maximum sustainable velocity (called U&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as burst swimming.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/Fish8x.jpg" alt=" " align="middle"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGZZ2hfnI/AAAAAAAAAps/7mGC5jq7MGY/s1600-h/Fish8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:169px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGZZ2hfnI/AAAAAAAAAps/7mGC5jq7MGY/s400/Fish8.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagram from my thesis showing the swim tunnel apparatus. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/Fish3x.jpg" alt=" " align="middle"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGhIr7IgI/AAAAAAAAAp0/83mUYxvuGGE/s1600-h/Fish3x.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:350px;height:230px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGhIr7IgI/AAAAAAAAAp0/83mUYxvuGGE/s400/Fish3x.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The actual swim tunnel, which we knew as "Big Bertha".  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The quantification of feeding rates of individual fish (and by extension, their dominance rank) probably represented the most unusual component of the study. These were assessed by feeding the fish opaque glass beads mixed into the food and x-raying them so the beads in their stomachs could be counted. McMaster's biology department is adjacent to a hospital, so I was able to secure the use of a small, portable x-ray machine that I could cart over to the lab on weekends. To make bead-laden food, I ground up fish pellets and mixed them with beads in a spaghetti maker, extruded the mush into strands and cut them into small pieces. I had to prepare all the food this way as a control, but I only gave them food with beads on days when they were to be x-rayed. To develop the x-ray images, I would go into the dark room in the radiology depatment of the hospital. This involved feeding the exposed films through an automatic developing machine which dropped the developed images into a slot outside the dark room. More than once I came out to find radiologists glancing curiously at my pictures of fish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGo7edwRI/AAAAAAAAAp8/f45Xg9_t2Z4/s1600-h/Fish4x.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:350px;height:280px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGo7edwRI/AAAAAAAAAp8/f45Xg9_t2Z4/s400/Fish4x.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/Fish4x.jpg" alt=" " align="middle"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical x-ray film showing the difference in feeding among individual fish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scientificblogging.com/files/Fish5x.jpg" alt=" " align="middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGwtw8API/AAAAAAAAAqE/_9ysEzvIxd0/s1600-h/Fish5x.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:350px;height:113px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpGwtw8API/AAAAAAAAAqE/_9ysEzvIxd0/s400/Fish5x.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close up of one fish showing the beads (white spots) in its stomach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first  attempt at the study did not go well. The fish I had chosen were too small, and some even escaped from the swim chamber. I had chosen too high a ration to feed the fish, and the competition among individuals was negligible. I even had a flood in one tank and came in to find several fish flopping around on the floor before I returned them to their tank. &lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2: Be prepared for even the most carefully planned experiment to be a bust at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;first. &lt;/span&gt;As a matter of fact, I decided to start again after the holidays with larger fish and different rations. Given the short time involved (two semesters, one of which had then passed), it took some convincing for Dr. Wood to let me start from scratch. However, I knew I would not be confident in the data from the  first run and I was fairly certain I had worked out the bugs the  first time through. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, we discovered that the fish who eat the most and grow the fastest do indeed show poorer sustained swimming performance, but only in the case where the ration is limited. Faster growing fish have better burst swimming abilities, by contrast. This supports the idea that there may be trade-offs between rapid growth and some types of swimming ability, at least when food is limited, meaning that there may be limits on the benefits of growing more quickly than other individuals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I worked in the Wood Lab during the summer after this study and did two follow-up experiments. We also polished up my thesis and submitted it to a journal -- I still remember how excited I was to have my  first paper in review. Some major revisions later, the paper was &lt;a href="http://rparticle.web-p.cisti.nrc.ca/rparticle/AbstractTemplateServlet?calyLang=eng&amp;amp;journal=cjfas&amp;amp;volume=55&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;issue=7&amp;amp;msno=f98-044"&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;  for publication.  &lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3: Be prepared for peer reviewers to pick apart every detail of your work.&lt;/strong&gt;  (Not to worry, as I have since reviewed several fish physiology and feeding behaviour papers in turn).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpG8-CZdgI/AAAAAAAAAqM/Lvy8ef5pLHs/s1600-h/Fish6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:247px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScpG8-CZdgI/AAAAAAAAAqM/Lvy8ef5pLHs/s400/Fish6.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I finished these studies more than a decade ago, and I now work in a very different area of biology. Nevertheless, the lessons that I learned during my first experience  with original research  are as significant as ever now that I advise students. If I have done my job well in this role, you may read a similar account from one of my students 10 years hence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;________&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;Gregory, T.R. and C.M.

Before moving on to the specific projects that I would most like to do in the near term if I had the funds, I want to discuss the basic philosophical approach that much of my lab's work follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-science-works.html"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; recently, there is a strong tendency among many biologists to assume that only "hypothesis-driven" science is valid and informative.  I disagree with this position very strongly, as I think it causes people to focus on narrow questions and runs a real risk of making most science little more than an exercise in confirming and refining what we already know.  Moreover, it is only feasible to structure one's research in the simple, falsificationist hypothesis-testing format if there is extensive background knowledge available.  When working in a new area where little is known, this is not possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does this mean we should be allowed to just stumble around without really testing any ideas?  Of course it doesn't.  The alternative is to step back from individual hypotheses and to carry out what I call "targeted exploration".  This means that we do not feel it necessary to formulate our research in the simplistic "Ho, H1" format with a "yes/no" result structure.  Instead, we take what information is available and try to identify patterns.  If no information is available at all for some area, then we might explore it with the specific purpose of looking for patterns.  Once a possible pattern is identified, we determine ways of testing how broadly it holds and what might be causing it.  This involves more exploration, but specifically in areas that are intended to provide the necessary data to test the broad pattern.  If the pattern holds, then we can formulate even more specific ideas about causation, leading eventually to the testing of particular hypotheses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some important points should be noted.  First, targeted exploration does not conflict with focused hypothesis testing.  Rather, it ultimately feeds into hypothesis-driven research, but is particularly important because it takes us into new territory rather than working within existing areas.  Second, it is not done blind.  There is a specific reason to target particular areas.  Third, as it does not have a simple refuted/supported result but rather can be set up to reveal many different things, the results can be very informative either way.  Finally, because it is based on large-scale sampling, exploration of this type has the beneficial side effect of closing some major gaps in our basic knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me give you an example of how this works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insects are by far the most diverse group of animals, at least in terms of described species.  However, they have traditionally been poorly covered in animal genome size studies.  When I was a graduate student, I compiled the Animal Genome Size Database, which made it possible to look across all the data that were available and see what patterns emerged.  Based on work in amphibians, it was apparent that species with complex developmental programs including metamorphosis had smaller genomes than species without metamorphosis.  I wondered if something similar might apply to insects, given that there are orders with complete metamorphosis (holometabolous development) and orders with incomplete metamorphosis (hemimetabolous development).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; step 1&lt;/span&gt;: ask a question and look for a pattern.  The data for insects were very limited, but it did seem as though insects with complete metamorphosis possess smaller genomes than those lacking complete metamorphosis, making this similar to the case in amphibians.  However, there were not really enough data to say much about this, so as part of my graduate work I set out to get more insect data.  I added a few hundred species, mostly just whatever I could get locally, and doing my best to include species from several orders with and without metamorphosis. That is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;step 2&lt;/span&gt;: assemble a dataset that can at least be used to identify a possible pattern.  At this stage, the sampling is somewhat unconstrained -- just get whatever you can, with the question still in mind.  Why do it like this?  Because a) you don't have enough information to be very specific in what data you need, b) you're working in a new area, so any data you get will be informative, and c) you don't know if the pattern you are looking for is really the main pattern, so it is best to sample more widely in case some other pattern shows up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is what I found:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScorbIutk1I/AAAAAAAAApU/4eHKoyLMTWk/s1600-h/metamorphosis.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:457px;height:326px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/ScorbIutk1I/AAAAAAAAApU/4eHKoyLMTWk/s400/metamorphosis.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the exception of one beetle species out of more than 150 (and I still want to check this myself), no insects with complete metamorphosis appear to have genome sizes larger than 2pg (~ 2 billion base pairs).  On the other hand, orders without complete metamorphosis often include species with enormous genomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;step 3&lt;/span&gt; is then to see whether this holds with a broader sampling.  Now we are getting into the targeted exploration.  What we need is a) more data from holometabolous orders (do they exceed this threshold and we just haven't found them?) and b) more from hemimetabolous orders (do most of them have examples that are larger than the threshold?).  Since this possible pattern was identified, we have added hundreds of species from both kinds of insects, including about 400 butterflies and moths (holometabolous, none larger than 2pg), 90 wasps, ants, and bees (holometabolous, none larger than 2pg), 75 flies (holometabolous, none larger than 2pg), and 100 dragonflies (about 1/5 of known diversity in North America; hemimetabolous, a few larger than 2pg).  So far, so good, and this work continues with current projects on wasps, flies, caddisflies, and stone flies.  But questions remain: Does this hold in additional orders?  Is there really a link between development and genome size in insects?  Why 2pg?  Are there other explanations (e.g., other constraints, phylogenetic effects, differences at the level of mutational mechanisms)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;step 4&lt;/span&gt;, we started to test this idea that development constrains genome size in insects.  First, we looked at the rate of development (egg to adult) within a single genus (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drosophila&lt;/span&gt;), and found a significant correlation with genome size.  We have also started looking at "curious" orders that may be exceptions that prove the rule: for example, mayflies have an additional nymphal moult that other hemimetabolous orders don't, so this may impose an additional constraint and keep their genomes small -- I have only looked at one so far (yes, small), but I will let you know how it turns out once we do a large sample.  We are also looking at specific comparisons within orders based on a combination of their traits (developmental rate, parasitic vs free living, body size, flight) and phylogenetic relationships.  In this case, shifts in lifestyle are especially informative because they may illustrate an evolutionary association between genome size and the characteristics of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming these patterns hold up and we are convinced that development is linked with genome size, we will want to know how -- thus, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;step 5&lt;/span&gt;.  The most likely mechanistic bridge between genome size and organism development is cell division.  However, no one has looked at cell division rate across insects with different genome sizes.  This would be much more difficult than doing large-scale surveys, but it could be focused on a few representative species with different DNA amounts.  If we really want to know if DNA content affects cell division, we would need to examine this experimentally in &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;step 6&lt;/span&gt; -- for example, by actively adding or removing different amounts of DNA and observing the effects on cell cycle parameters.  I have been trying for a few years to get funding to do this (in yeast initially), but no success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it is obvious that this kind of approach falls outside the typical hypothesis-driven focus.  However, it does get us from knowing almost nothing in step 1 to formulating and testing specific hypotheses in step 6.  Along the way, we have greatly expanded the available dataset, and have revealed several additional patterns worh exploring within some orders.  If I had to express each step in the form of hypotheses, I probably could, but because we are exploring so many questions at once in each step, it makes more sense to just think about questions and make sure the sampling will allow us to generate answers.  Without the existing knowledge base, focusing on one hypothesis only is premature and very limiting in what it will accomplish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously, we are not just interested in insects.  Over the rest of the series, I will talk about other groups that we are eager to explore, and will discuss in more detail some of the focused work on mechanisms that I am interested in.  Some of these therefore begin at step 1, others at step 6, and some somewhere in between.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-1532578750835690053?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/gCOd8LeJdrc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1238004031400"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3515b9d50037ef52</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Tune In!</title><published>2009-03-25T17:50:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T17:50:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/488-tune-in.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The indomitable Eric Krieg of PhACT - the Philadelphia Association for Critical Thinking - tells us to watch &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032600/"&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/a&gt;, 7pm EDT, Sunday March 29th.  One of the half-hour segments will be on scammer Dennis Lee's latest deceit - a nationally-sold $1000+ fuel-saver kit he claimed would get at least a 50% mileage boost - they say often over 100mpg - using the phony old magnets, fuel additives and hydrogen electrolysis devices.  Lee claims to have thousands of happy customers, though he's unable - even for a $1000 offer - to find any of them willing to participate in a proper demo of the mileage advantage he claims.  Eric was recently sued by Lee, and that suit was dismissed by the court.

Exactly what is he arguing for, and what is the basis for his argument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The simplified argument goes like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since (p) rational people in distinct geographical locations around the globe adopt and defend a wide diversity of religious faiths due to their upbringing and culture, (q) we should be skeptical of our own culturally adopted religious faith and upbringing with the same level of skepticism we use to critically evaluate other religious faiths..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P --&amp;gt; Q&lt;br&gt;P&lt;br&gt;.: Q&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually there’s more to P than what I included in P. And there’s more to Q as well. People in distinct geographical locations around the globe adopt and defend the religion of their upbringing and culture. This is an undeniable sociological fact. Anthropology shows us that human beings are locked inside their own cultures and cannot, without the greatest of difficulty, transcend their culturally adopted beliefs. Psychology shows us that human beings do not examine their beliefs dispassionately but rather seek to confirm that which they already believe. And unlike scientific, political and moral beliefs there are no mutually agreed upon tests to determine which religius faith is true. Therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the religion a person adopts and defends is overwhelmingly dependent upon the “accidents of birth” rather than on a rational assessment of the case based upon the available evidence. Since this is so we should be just as skeptical of our own religious upbringing as we are with the other religious faiths we reject. The odds are that we’re wrong. We should be skeptical of our religiously inherited faih with the same amount of skepticism as we use to judge the other religious faiths that we reject. Here we have the notion of being “outsiders” to the religious faith in question, and as such it’s called “The Outsider Test for Faith.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Second, it would be cheating to have a test and just mark our religious beliefs as the beliefs to be tested. Keith Parsons once asked, "Tell me, do you really think that, had you been born Vijay instead of Victor, and if you were from Bangalore rather than Phoenix, AZ, that you would not now be as devoted to Brahma as you are to God?" And the answer is I don't know. If Keith had grown up in the United Methodist church that I did, and had he discovered Plantinga or Lewis before leaving the fold, as opposed to converting briefly to West Rome Baptist Church and hearing weekly hellfire threats as an undergraduate, would he now be a Christian philosopher instead of an atheist? The "what if" game is far harder than it looks to play.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don’t mean to single out religious beliefs here, although that is indeed my focus. They are just more assuredly determined by one’s cultural upbringing than anything else we can predict. Some things would surely be hard to predict if events had turned out differently. I admit that we are all strongly influenced by the people and circumstances around us. This is what psychological studies show us. With different influences Keith Parsons could've ended up as a Christian philosopher, yes. That’s indeed how malleable the human mind is, his, mine, and Reppert's too. With different influences Reppert could've been an atheist philosopher! This is who we are as human beings. What we think and believe is molded and shaped by all of our experiences and influences, including everyone we talk to or study with, and everything we have ever read or witnessed. We know this even if we may not be able to predict what would’ve happened had something different taken place in someone’s life. I do know that had something different taken place then a particular person would be different in some ways, depending on the event and the impact that event had on him or her. But there are some things that are easier to predict, and one thing seems clearly to be the case that if we were born in different culture and with a different upbringing we would adopt the faith of our upbringing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said:&lt;blockquote&gt;But I happen to know something about Vijay. Keith and I agree that there is an independently existing physical world. Vijay does not. If either of us had been born Vijay, we would think of the world of experience as maya, or illusion, and we would not see it as ultimately real. So it looks as if external world realism fails the outsider test. Yet I see no reason to be accept external world skepticism because if I had been born in India, I might have been brought up to reject external world realism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this case Vijay would have to subject his own religious upbringing to the same kind of skepticism he uses to evaluate Christianity, the most materialistic of religions, as C.S. Lewis claimed. I think if Vijay did this he would end up being a skeptic about his prior held belief that the world is an illusion, or &lt;em&gt;maya&lt;/em&gt;, which is a belief of his that goes against all the available evidence. Again, Vijay needs to subject that culturally adopted religious belief to skepticism. And in this regard Reppert is missing the point. Vijay’s views would not represent skepticism at all. His Eastern views are based in his religious faith, and as such I’m asking him to be skeptical of them. With regard to Reppert I'm not asking him to subject his knowledge that there is a real world with the religious faith of a Vijay that the world is an illusion. If Reppert wants to instead talk about some kind of extreme type of Cartesian skepticism which might lead someone to solipsism then he’s attributing to me a kind of skepticism of which I do not embrace at all, which no one can be that skeptical anyway. The OTF does not ask for complete and utter skepticism. It merely asks us to be as skeptical of our own culturally adopted religious faith as we are of the others we reject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said: &lt;blockquote&gt;What about moral beliefs? I think that rape is wrong. If I had been brought up in a certain culture, I'm told, I would believe that rape is OK if you do it in the evening, because a woman's place is at home under her husband's protection, and if she is gone she's asking for it. So my belief that rape is wrong flunks the outsider test. This gives me no basis whatsoever for doubting that rape is wrong. &lt;/blockquote&gt;There is a difference between moral and religious beliefs, although they are indeed intertwined in many religions. The OTF is a test to examine religious faiths, not moral or political beliefs. When I refer to religious faith, I’m referring to beliefs that are essential for a member to be accepted in a particular religious community of faith who worship together and/or accept the same divinely inspired prophetic/revelations and/or those beliefs whereby one’s position in the afterlife depends. The reason for this definition is clear, since the outsider test is primarily a challenge about the religious faith of communities of people. It also applies secondarily in lesser degrees to individual philosophers espousing metaphysical, political, and/or ethical viewpoints who are not guided primarily by communal religious experiences but who are still influenced by the cultural milieu in which they live. Hence the OTF will have a much greater degree of force against religious faiths of religious communities than on individual philosophers not involved in a religious community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So can we apply this same skepticism to moral beliefs? Should I be as skeptical that rape is wrong as I am that rape is morally acceptable? No. Absolutely not. Again, look at the specific criteria I provided. I said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The amount of skepticism warranted depends on the number of rational people who disagree, whether the people who disagree are separated into distinct geographical locations, the nature of those beliefs, how they originated, how they were personally adopted in the first place, and the kinds of evidence that can possibly be used to decide between them. My claim is that when it comes to religious beliefs a high degree of skepticism is warranted because of these factors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That’s what I said, and so in this instance as with many other moral beliefs they do not suffer the same consequences from applying the OTF. Beliefs like the acceptability of rape are based on religious beliefs anyway, so they are subject to the outsider test precisely because of the nature and origin of those beliefs, as I said. I know of no non-believer who would ever want to defend the morality of rape, for instance, unlike believers in the past and present who do because of some so-called inspired text. We know rape is wrong, and we also know that this kind of behavior is sanctioned by religious beliefs, as is honor killing. The religious person who thinks rape is morally acceptable should subject that belief to skepticism as an outsider. And when he does this he will begin to doubt his previously held religious/moral beliefs, as I’ve argued. When it comes to Reppert, I think his moral belief that rape is wrong will survive his own skepticism, for there is evidence that as a father of a daughter he would want to help maintain a free society where she can go about her business free from being accosted. If Reppert wants to provide an argument where he can defend the morality of rape I’d like to see this. I would find it very strange if in order to escape the OTF Reppert must defend the morality of rape. That seems too high of a price to pay, but if that’s what he wants to do, then I’m all ears. [Speaking of morality, let me remind the reader that I’ve argued elsewhere that morality &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/atheism-christianity-and-morality.html"&gt;has evolved&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said:&lt;blockquote&gt;What about political beliefs? I think that representative democracy is a better form of government than monarchy. If I lived in 16th Century Europe, or in other parts of the globe, I probably would not believe that. So my belief in democratic government flunks the outsider test. However, this gives me no reason to have the least doubt that democracy is better than monarchy. &lt;/blockquote&gt;The same things can be said about political beliefs as I said about moral beliefs. Listen, there are a great many political and moral beliefs which we think are essential to a human society but which are not necessary at all. Democracy is one of them. People have done fine without democracy from the beginning when a dominant male lion or ape ruled the others and had free reign with a harem of females. That being said I think there is evidence that supports the fact that as rational animals we are happier when we have a say in how a country is run. And we have also found ways to include minority thinking too, with some proper checks and balances. And when people around the world vote with their feet they sail, fly and run to a democratic government. Further evidence for this is the crumbling of dictatorial socialist communist governments. But once again, I would find it very strange if in order to escape the OTF Reppert must deny that democracy is a better form of government than a monarchy or dictatorship. That seems too high of a price to pay, but if that’s what he wants to do, then I’m all ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said: &lt;blockquote&gt;What about scientific beliefs? If I had been born in the Islamic world, or in some Christian churches, I would have been taught to reject the theory of evolution in its entirety. So it looks like the theory of evolution fails the outsider test. Nevertheless, this in itself is insufficient grounds for the slightest doubt about evolution. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Here it becomes obvious that Reppert does not know what the OTF is about. Scientific thinking is in a different category altogether from religious faiths (see the specific criteria mentioned above). We do not learn about science merely from our parents, although hopefully we do. We can personally do the experiments ourselves. So scientific testing is independent of what someone tells us to believe and so it does not require the same level of skepticism about its conclusions. There are mathematical and experimental results that are independently verified time and again. But when it comes to religious faiths there are no mutually agreed upon reliable tests to decide between them, and this makes all of the difference in the world. With regard to Reppert’s example, the OTF requires religious believers to subject their creationist theories to the skepticism of the scientist, theories which were learned on their Mama’s knee and tenaciously defended because some ancient superstitious pre-scientific set of writings say so. Science and scientific thinking is the best and probably only antidote to these creationist religious myths, myths which other religions differ about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, a certain natural conservatism with respect to changing our minds about matters of world-view, or any other issue for that matter, is both natural and rational. I thought the lesson of things like Cartesian foundationalism is that if you throw out all sort of beliefs as unjustified and load the burden of proof onto those beliefs, it's hard to stop and have anything left. Most people thought that Descartes had to cheat to get his world back. If we have to be skeptics about all of our sociologically conditioned beliefs, I am afraid we are going to be skeptics about a lot more than just religion. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, it’s certainly the case that &lt;em&gt;conservatism &lt;/em&gt;is natural with respect to people not wanting to change their beliefs. It’s so natural to us that we as human beings will go to some extreme lengths to defend what we want to believe. So I see nothing about this conservatism which is justified, otherwise, at some extreme level we’d still believe in Santa Claus, or that our fathers can do anything, or patriots would still defend America “whether right or wrong” in their later years. This also undercuts the whole notion that such conservatism is &lt;em&gt;rational &lt;/em&gt;as well. The rational thing to do, which we humans are not too good at, is to grow and learn and think and investigate and follow the arguments and evidence wherever they lead. That's the rational thing to do despite wanting to hold on to beliefs which cannot be reasonably justified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, I see no reason at all for thinking the OTF should lead us to complete and utter skepticism. None. It’s merely a test to critically evaluate one’s culturally adopted religious faith with the same type of skepticism s/he uses to evaluate other religious faiths. As I have argued, the kind of skepticism involved here is a reasonable one and something we should all adopt about religious faith, especially one’s own. The more outlandish and extraordinary the claim is then the more evidence we should require to support such a claim. This is very reasonable and I see no reason to think otherwise at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to skepticism in general though, it should be thought of as resting on a continuum, anyway. Some claims we should be extremely skeptical about (“I saw a pink elephant;” “the CIA is dogging my steps”), while others on the opposite side will not require much skepticism at all (“there is a material world;” “if you drop a book it will fall to the ground;” “George Washington was the first President of America”). I do indeed think we should have a healthy amount of skepticism toward all of our beliefs on this continuum. Skepticism is virtue.

As most skeptics will agree, it’s not possible to prove God exists, and you certainly can’t prove a negative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I can argue against are some &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; on this topic. Do people see God in a pattern of wood grain, or is that just our eyes and brains interpreting random patterns after hundreds of millennia of evolutionary pressure to do so? Does a statue really weep milk, or is it fraud? Does intercessory prayer actually work, or does study after study show it does not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you see the difference. It’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also note that I have but one single commenting policy on this blog: don’t be a jerk. It has broad ramifications, of course, but it does really cover the rules I enforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll admit that I should delete &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/20/creationist-heh-master-of-science-haha-degree-hahahahaha/#comment-165904"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; that was made on my post last week about creationism, since it obviously violates the rule. But sometimes it’s important that we see just how breathtakingly inane some arguments are, yet they never seem to die. Here is the comment, in its entirety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You people are idiots:&lt;br&gt;
March 22nd, 2009 at 2:57 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some quick questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was the Universe created? The Big Bang? Oh. So where did the material that caused the Big Bang come from? Where did the “spark” that ignited the Big Bang come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the flaw in your theory that it all happened by “accident” and not by design. No matter how you answer, the next question will be: And where did THAT come from? Eventually, you will have to answer: I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God will be there saying: I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ignoring the stunning hypocrisy of someone preaching the word of God and calling us all idiots, there is an obvious, gaping flaw in this commenter’s logic, well-known to skeptics for years: if you ask where the Big Bang came from, &lt;em&gt;why can’t you ask the same thing of God?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person like this is asked who or what created God, the standard answer is that God always existed. But why can’t we say the same about the Universe itself? It’s entirely possible the Universe is a part of a larger structure, a metaverse, if you will, that always existed and always will. Our understanding of the nature of time is still incomplete, so something like this is not out of the question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the details of this aren’t terribly important; the key thing here is the pot calling the kettle black. This so-called flaw in the Big Bang theory, if it is a flaw, is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a flaw in the supposition that God always existed as well. As such, it’s a terrible argument for the existence of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the comment, though, is the statement, &amp;quot;Eventually, you will have to answer: I don’t know.&amp;quot; As usual, someone like this has it &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; backwards: we can say that &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; we don’t know. But the thing is, &lt;strong&gt;science learns&lt;/strong&gt;. The greatest mysteries of today are undergraduate homework problems in 20 years. That’s the strength of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogma, however, is unswerving, unbending, unyielding, and unable to learn. What the commenter has done is used a fallacy called &amp;quot;the God of the gaps&amp;quot;, inserting God into the gaps in your knowledge. But as we learn more, the gaps narrow. And when the gap is filled, what of God? This is the trap of the zealot: when new evidence comes along contradicting their position, they have to either ignore it or lie about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New evidence is coming in all the time, too. I hope the commenter keeps up with modern cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I will simply ask: if there is evidence of design, &lt;em&gt;where is it?&lt;/em&gt; I’ve seen many claims, but they always fall short. Remember, the claimants come here, so if they want to persuade me then I need to see the evidence on my own terms. And I will not count a book that makes claims from revelation, because that’s not evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, if you want to believe in God with no evidence, or even despite evidence, that is your right; it’s everyone’s right. But if you want to persuade others using a scientific basis, or show that our current scientific ideas are wrong, then you’d better have something more than &amp;quot;Because I say so.&amp;quot; Obviously, coming into this argument armed only with that… well, there’s only one way to win using that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While I would love nothing more than to be a savant at something--especially ballet, painting, or piano--I'm not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a small percentage of autistic people possess savant skills. A similar myth is that all autistic people have genius I.Q. scores. Honestly, I would love nothing more than to be addressing an awestruck audience, at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_prize"&gt;Nobel Prize Award Ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, in regards to my unbelievable wondrous work in quantum physics. But it isn't going to happen--not in this lifetime, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism cannot always be seen. Matter of fact, I could be talking to another autistic person and neither of us would know we were both on the autistic spectrum unless it were to be revealed. Autistics are everywhere. We hold all types of jobs and positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it is vital to remember that most, if not all, autistic people have uneven skills. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Struggling with basic math concepts, yet excelling at advanced math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successful at a job of high status, yet lacking self care skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highly organized with tangible objects, yet disastrously unorganized with non-tangibles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazing at working with computers, yet unable to make a sandwich without visual step-by-step photos or instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brilliantly fluent when communicating via writing, yet nonverbal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smooth at conversing on specific topics, yet at a loss when the subject changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from my own life experience, is that I am fairly proficient at carrying out complicated tasks that have been broken down to me via step-by-step instruction. On the other hand, I often need to be explicitly told to do simple things, even if I have already given my consent in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my mother had a knee replacement surgery. Before her surgery, she had asked if I would stay with her, as my father would be out of town the following week. I agreed. The day my father left, my mother asked me what I would like to order for dinner. Confused, I replied by asking her why we were having dinner together. Returning a confused look, my mother slowly pushed her eyeglasses back into place while reminding me of my consent to stay with her. I panicked. Suddenly, I felt as if the rug had been pulled from under me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my mother had said this, the day before my father left--or even earlier--it would have made the situation, or transition, effortless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesjordan/2949723304/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2949723304_e0127a5967_m.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Elesia, your father is leaving on Sunday. Remember when you agreed to stay with me for one week? You need to prepare your things because it is almost time for you to come. Also, let me know what you would like for dinner on our first night together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that I'll ever cease to amaze my mother. I mean, how can I be composing blogs for Change.org, managing my own blog site, taking care of two children, going to ballet class, and then not be able to process a previously agreed upon week-long stay? Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already done so, take a look at this Change.org action:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/support_awareness_understanding_of_uneven_skills_in_autistics"&gt;Support Awareness &amp;amp; Understanding of Uneven Skills In Autistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As newspapers cut back, the amount of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/04/comment.pressandpublishing"&gt;churnalism&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005148.html"&gt;science-related journalism&lt;/a&gt; is likely to get worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Ben is suggesting, I guess, would be something like Google News for science, with the addition of links to the underlying scientific publications (if any), and to coverage in blogs and web forums.

To honor the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"&gt;world’s first computer programmer&lt;/a&gt;, bloggers posted something about a woman who made a significant contribution to science or technology.  &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2009/03/a-lab-of-their-own.html"&gt;Serious bloggers&lt;/a&gt; wrote detailed and engaging pieces, but we overdue authors don’t have time for that.  So instead, only one day late, here’s a short excerpt from my book draft, about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung_Wu"&gt;Chien-Shiung Wu&lt;/a&gt; and the discovery of parity violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————————————————————–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came as quite a surprise in the 1950’s when parity was shown not to be a symmetry of nature, largely through the efforts of three Chinese-born American physicists:  Tsung-Dao Lee, Chen-Ning Yang, and Chien-Shiung Wu.  The idea of parity violation had been floating around for a while, suggested by various people but never really taken seriously.  In physics, credit traditionally accrues not just to someone who makes an offhand suggestion, but to someone who takes that suggestion seriously enough to put in the work and turn it into a respectable theory or a decisive experiment.  In the case of parity violation, it was Lee and Yang who sat down and performed a careful analysis of the problem.  They discovered that there was ample experimental evidence that electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force both were invariant under &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, but that the question was open as far as the weak nuclear force was concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee and Yang also suggested a number of ways that one could search for parity violation in the weak interactions.  They finally convinced Wu, who was an experimentalist specializing in the weak interactions and Lee’s colleague at Columbia, that this was a project worth tackling.  She recruited physicists at the National Bureau of Standards to join her in performing an experiment on Cobalt-60 atoms in magnetic fields at very low temperatures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they designed the experiment, Wu became convinced of the project’s fundamental importance.  &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0605017"&gt;In a later recollection&lt;/a&gt;, she explained vividly what it is like to be caught up in the excitement of a crucial moment in science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Professor Lee’s visit, I began to think things through.  This was a golden opportunity for a beta-decay physicist to perform a crucial test, and how could I let it pass? — That Spring, my husband, Chia-Liu Yuan, and I had planned to attend a conference in Geneva and then proceed to the Far East. Both of us had left China in 1936, exactly twenty years earlier. Our passages were booked on the Queen Elizabeth before I suddenly realized that I had to do the experiment immediately, before the rest of the Physics Community recognized the importance of this experiment and did it first. So I asked Chia-Liu to let me stay and go without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the Spring semester ended in the last part of May, I started work in earnest in preparing for the experiment. In the middle of September, I finally went to Washington, D. C. for my first meeting with Dr. Ambler. … Between experimental runs in Washington, I had to dash back to Columbia for teaching and other research activities. On Christmas eve, I returned to New York on the last train; the airport was closed because of heavy snow. There I told Professor Lee that the observed asymmetry was reproducible and huge. The asymmetry parameter was nearly -1. Professor Lee said that this was very good. This result is just what one should expect for a two- component theory of the neutrino.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your spouse and a return to your childhood home will have to learn to wait – Science is calling!  Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957; Wu should have been included among the winners, but she wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a tall order, given the tsunami of &lt;a href="http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/b016a3b8-c0a8-2f11-0161-8d5496db95e8"&gt;bad information&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism-myths.org/2008/09/the-amish-anomaly/"&gt;urban myth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/content/news/investigators/story/Wilson-Some-Vaccines-Still-Contain-Mercury/2qKdWV73REiVLhJB8ztX_Q.cspx"&gt;fear mongering&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/uc-davis-study-autism-is_b_156153.html"&gt;dishonesty&lt;/a&gt; bearing down on newsrooms. Judging from &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=47"&gt;last year’s crop of WAAD stories,&lt;/a&gt; too many reporters fall prey to baseless assumptions, such as the myth of the autism epidemic. Additionally, reflexive he-said-she-said reporting gives far too much credence to the discredited vaccine-autism connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a reporter’s good intentions can lead to the spread of misleading and even dangerous information. A staple of autism reporting is the Struggling Parents interview, which invariably focuses on unproven alternative treatments for autism, and a parent’s desperation to make her child “normal”. These stories usually note that a child has improved since starting the treatment. That’s no surprise. Given enough time, and lack of a control group, tap water will look like a miracle cure. That’s because autism is best understood as developmental delay, not stasis. All else being equal, these kids continue to grow and learn and adapt, albeit at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s an overworked general assignment reporter to do? First, beware of unwarranted and unproven assumptions, as you would with any story. A few that come to mind include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Myth of the Autism Epidemic.&lt;/em&gt; Virtually every wrong-headed idea about autism flows from the claims, far from confirmed, that we are experiencing an “epidemic” of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we call “autism” is really a spectrum of disorders ranging from mild to severe. Fringe anti-vaccine interest groups deliberately mislead when they tells us that the prevalence of autism has increased from 6 cases per 10,000 children in 1983 to 150 cases per 10,000 in 2008. Don’t be fooled. More than two-thirds of the children that are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders today would have received a difference diagnosis, or no label at all, 25 years ago.  There are a number of reasons for this. &lt;a href="http://www.unstrange.com/dsm1.html"&gt;Diagnostic criteria for autism&lt;/a&gt; have broadened since the 1980s, and today children with milder forms of the disorder are included. A large part of the increase can also be explained by diagnostic substitution, especially for children who have the more severe forms of the disorder who were once labeled mentally retarded. In fact, data show that as autism diagnoses rose during the 199os, cases of mental retardation decreased - strong evidence for diagnostic substitution. Furthermore, the percentage of children receiving special education services &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=297#more-297"&gt;has remained flat &lt;/a&gt;during a time when autism was supposedly skyrocketing. Check out this graph from D’oC at Autism Street:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="california1" src="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/california1-300x216.jpg" alt="california1" width="360" height="260"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the temptation to use skyrocket as a verb is great, but the fact is that claims for an autism epidemic are unfounded. What has skyrocketed is public awareness of the disorders. Be skeptical of anyone who tells you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must read article that explains how autism is diagnosed, and the reasons to be skeptical of claims for an epidemic, can be found &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/508429"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controversial vaccine-autism connection.&lt;/em&gt; Among bona-fide researchers there is no controversy. More than 25 studies over ten years and across three continents show no association between the MMR vaccine and autism. At least ten more similarly show no link between thimerosal containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharon Begley at &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; very nicely lays out the case against the TCV connection &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/185853"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The government has admitted that vaccines caused Hannah Poling’s autism. &lt;/em&gt;The US Federal Court of Claims, which hears vaccine injury cases, never ruled on the case because HHS conceded before it came to court. The standard of proof for vax cases is “more likely than not” - what lawyers call “50% and a feather”. The court was in fact set up during the Reagan administration to expedite vaccine injury claims, and claimants are paid by a fund drawn from a tax of 75 cents on every vaccine shot given. If Poling’s case was heard in civil court the family probably would have lost, since it is essentially unknowable what caused the girl’s symptoms of autism. Science blogger Steve Novella, MD, explains it &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=203"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Poling family’s physician, Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, says “there is no scientific basis for a connection between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or mercury (Hg) intoxication and autism.” Zimmerman’s comment &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/master%20autism..pdf"&gt;can be found in the report&lt;/a&gt; he submitted to the US Federal Court of Claims, as part of the recently concluded Omnibus Autism Proceeding. Scintillating analysis &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2004&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-57870"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No writer should go wanting for autism-related stories. An estimated 500,000 children in the US have an autism spectrum disorder, and the ways in which families, educators, and caregivers accommodate these kids is worth telling. Then there’s the shady and opportunistic &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;autism cure industry,&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/04/02/mccarthy.autsimtreatment/"&gt;vacuous celebrities &lt;/a&gt;who mislead and exploit parents.  It’s a target rich environment for any enterprising reporter willing to spend some extra time learning the facts. Don’t waste your time, or your readers’, chasing shadows.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237991730162"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6413">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/224d4358915a2341</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="children"/><category term="smoking"/><title type="html">Smoker-in-Chief</title><published>2009-03-25T15:53:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T15:53:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/fiM_78rPtqU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/smoker-in-chief/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Yesterday my 7-year-old daughter, Anya, was wearing a T-shirt I'd never seen before.

I feel really bad thinking about it now. Being mean and bullying was particularly ugly for one such as myself who had just barely reached the end of his years as an object of bullying. But I see a pattern there that wasn't visible to me at the time. It doesn't excuse my behaviour in the least, but it sort of explains it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H was thin as a rake and had a highly strung personality. She didn't seem to expect to be liked, and I believe few did like her much. Yet she wasn't the sort to fade into the background: she was quite raucous. Me and another boy wrote a parody of the Ten Commandments and taped it to the door of the veranda where our Bible study class convened. One of our commandments was "Thou shalt not covet the ample bosom of H". The joke here, such as it was, was that us boys had about as ample bosoms as H had at this stage. Somebody told me she cried when she saw the note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A was a rubenesque working-class girl who had received all that had been withheld from H and more. She wore a "BOY TOY" track suit, went pendulously topless on the beach and had a phlegmatic demeanour. She tried to be friendly to me, bless her heart, but I just sneered disdainfully at this Venus from the wrong side of the tracks. Luckily, A would take none of it: she asked angrily, "Why are you always so mean to me? Huh?". I mumbled an apology and then we avoided each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T also had an early onset of curves. Her personality was phlegmatic to the point of sleepiness, very quiet. One summer day she was sitting opposite to me and a friend on the commuter train wearing a mini skirt and no panty hose, her freckled thighs much in evidence. I quipped sardonically, "How very generous of you, T, to offer the world a glimpse of your fine assets!". T looked down and said nothing. I pretty much immediately felt bad about the whole thing, but I never apologised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See a theme? This adolescent boy, barely into sexual maturity, is being nasty to girls about their budding womanhood. Not just to any girls, but to ones with little social graces, and girls who, he feels, are deviating from his tribe's norms of female behaviour -- norms of modesty. I was mean out of sexual insecurity to girls I believed unlikely to fight back. Part of it was of course actually an expression of desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year later I hooked up with the woman who would become my first wife, and that took care of that, thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/being_mean_to_girls.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/5xcba1SQCLY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237989696332"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/subjecting_prisoners_to_quackery.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86245f33ce028785</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Subjecting prisoners to quackery</title><published>2009-03-25T14:05:27Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T14:05:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/Ttggas8BJzo/subjecting_prisoners_to_quackery.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/subjecting_prisoners_to_quackery.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've at times been asked where I come up with my blogging material. Since I've become fairly popular, one major source has been readers sending me stories. I often don't have time to respond, and most of them don't interest me enough to be motivated to write, but there are enough that do that I consider my readers to be a major source of material. Then there are medical and surgical journals, as well as sources like &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/"&gt;EurekaAlert!&lt;/a&gt; Then there are my numerous RSS feeds that I peruse on a daily or every-other-day basis in the evening or early in the morning. Then, of course, there are the various websites with--shall we say?--a pro-CAM orientation. It was from one of these that I found a story that appalled me almost as much as the infamous "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php"&gt;battlefield acupunctur&lt;/a&gt;e" stories I've come across recently. Now, instead of subjecting our best and bravest to pseudoscientific woo, now they're subjecting another population that lives in conditions where they can easily be taken advantage of to &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.acupuncture23mar23,0,7747340.story"&gt;placebo medicine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beyond the iron gate, the fence and the razor wire, 10 inmates in maroon uniforms sit in stillness, listening to the serene sounds of sitar music. Eyes closed, hands folded, they await the tiny pricks of acupuncture needles being inserted delicately in their ears.

&lt;p&gt;Ancient Chinese medicine came to Baltimore's jail 16 years ago with the promise of curbing the cravings of drug addiction. Since then, acupuncture has been the centerpiece of a treatment program that serves nearly 700 inmates each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern science has not found solid evidence that it works. Still, the inmates claim that with acupuncture, all they crave are the meditative moments it brings. They say it soothes them and helps clear their cluttered minds to find the strength to confront their addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I've done buprenorphine and methadone, but neither one of them could compare to those needles," says Derrick Brooks, 42, who's battled heroin his entire adult life. "Those needles put you in touch with stuff that's within you that no pill or nothing else could do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adults of many animal species play a crucial role in the social development of youngsters. A new study reveals that the ratio of adults to young plays a much more important role in social development than the mere presence of adults.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until now, Triceratops was thought to be unusual among its ceratopsid relatives. While many ceratopsids--a common group of herbivorous dinosaurs that lived toward the end of the Cretaceous--have been found in enormous bonebed deposits of multiple individuals, all known Triceratops (over 50 in total) fossils have been solitary individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How skilled? Yeah, &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; skilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://alpo-j.asahikawa-med.ac.jp/kk09/o090320z.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/iss_fromground.jpg" alt="ISS imaged from the ground"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shot, taken on March 20, shows the Space Shuttle Discovery docked with the International Space Station… &lt;em&gt;taken from the ground&lt;/em&gt;. Vandebergh used a 25 cm telescope with a video camera to get this shot; he tracked the telescope by hand using an ordinary finder ’scope mounted on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the image is fuzzy — the placement of the Shuttle and ISS in the sky wasn’t optimal — the detail is incredible. I found a diagram on the NASA site with a drawing of the Shuttle docked to the ISS. Though it’s not perfect, the angles approximate what Vandebergh got, and you can identify structures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3383429028/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3630/3383429028_d2dec2a103.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click to embiggen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, eh? You can see the back end of Discovery poking out from under the station (the payload bay doors are open), as well as ISS solar panels and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/166624main_iss_config_012007.jpg"&gt;other features&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance getting a shot this clear might seem impossible, but in fact the math backs it up. The ISS orbits at 350 km over the surface of the Earth. Let’s say it’s straight overhead, so it’s as close (and therefore as big) as it can get. The wingspan of the ISS is a little over 100 yards. Doing the math&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/issfootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I get that the station would be about 1 arcminute in size, or about 1/60th of a degree (for comparison, the Moon is 0.5 degrees across). That’s interesting; the resolution of the human eye is about an arcminute! So when it’s directly overhead, people with keen eyesight will just be able to see the station is not just a dot, but has an actual shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know that. &lt;strong&gt;Wow&lt;/strong&gt;. Through binoculars it’ll be very cool to see. I’ll have to try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, through a decent telescope — and Vandebergh’s 25 cm Newtonian is definitely a good sized ’scope — you can actually get a good shot of the station. Usually, though, atmospheric turbulence blurs out the picture (which is also &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/twinkle.html"&gt;why stars twinkle&lt;/a&gt;). The trick is to use a video camera: that takes many frames rapidly, hopefully cutting down on the blurring in the same way that a fast exposure of a race car is sharp, while a longer one is blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, you can do even better. The blurring changes not only in time but in space as well. So in a given frame, the starboard solar panels might be sharp, but the port panels blurred. You can take multiple frames from the video and stitch them together, taking only the best parts and deleting the worst. I’ve seen some incredibly detailed images of the Shuttle and ISS taken from the ground; try a Google search and you’ll see plenty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, astrophotographer Vincent Miu &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/science/vincents-sydney-shutter-snaps-shuttle-in-space-20090324-988l.html"&gt;shot this same ISS+Shuttle configuration just this week&lt;/a&gt; as well, and last year, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/05/08/not-so-close-encounter/"&gt;the ISS was caught passing Venus in the sky during the day&lt;/a&gt;. I imagine anyone with a good ’scope and a video camera mounted to it can get this sort of thing. That seems incredible to me, but such is they way astronomy has been transformed in the modern era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget, you can see the ISS easily with the naked eye (it can now get brighter than Venus, thanks to the new solar panels). Check out &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens Above&lt;/a&gt; to see when it’s overhead! As soon as it clears up here in Boulder I’ll be out with my own binocs. I trust the math, but it always helps to verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;a name="issfootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The apparent size of an object depends on how big and how far away it is. The formula is angle = constant x d/D, where d = size, D = distance, and the constant is 206,265 (which is arcseconds per radian, if you’re curious, to convert from natural units to arcseconds). 100 meters/ 350,000 meters x 206265 = about 60 arcseconds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone seems to agree that real conflicts of interest in medical research and practice is a bad thing and steps should be taken to minimize, eliminate, and illuminate any such conflicts. The controversy revolves around what constitutes a real conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is broad agreement that researchers should not have a personal financial stake in the outcome of their own research - they should not make more money if their research is positive than if it’s negative. That creates a clear and powerful bias.  There is also now broad agreement and adoption of standards that speakers, authors, and researchers should disclose any potential conflicts of interest - primarily the source of their funding. If someone is being paid by a drug company to say that their drug is effective for a particular disease, they should disclose that up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same standard are now being applied to IRBs - institutional review boards, and that seems apprpriate. Every institution that does biomedical research must have an IRB, which is a committee of appropriate professionals (and there are rules as to the IRB’s constitution) that review all human research proposals to make sure they meet ethical guidelines and that subjects are adequately protected. This is a good system that generally works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/03/25/policies.regarding.irb.members.industry.relationships.often.lacking"&gt;A recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, however, discusses the fact that the same disclosure of conflicts of interest required for researchers is lacking when it comes to IRBs. This is a “who’s watching the watchers” type of concern. This is easy enough to fix - simply require IRB members to disclose their conflicts of interest to the institutions that appoint them. There are already stringent ethical guidelines for IRB members, so this would be, in my opinion, a small but necessary tweak to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that big problems with IRBs do not at times occur. &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=345"&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt;, Mark and David Geier formed their own institute and therefore their own IRB, packed with friends and supporters, to approve their highly dubious and ethically questionable study of lupron and chelation therapy for autism.  The hole here seems to be that IRB regulation is largely left to institutions - but what if those institutions are bogus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicts and Witch Hunts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is much common ground regarding conflicts of interest, there is also much controversy.  The British Medical Journal recently published &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/search?fulltext=drug+industry%2C+academia&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;five contrasting views&lt;/a&gt; on what the relationship should be between industry and academia. Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the NEJM and professor of social medicine at Harvard, takes the most extreme view - none. She feels that there should be no ties between industry and academia, doctors, or patients, because all such ties constitute marketing on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, and the purpose of marketing is to distort the practice of medicine (specifically to increase drug sales).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others propose allowing but regulating industry-academic collaboration. These regulations would include eliminating direct to consumer advertising, funding continuing medical education (CME), and forgoing all industry gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the pro-industry end of the spectrum Gordon Coutts, Vice President and General Manager at Schering Plough UK, argues that collaboration between academia and industry has the potential to foster innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important conversation to have, and I think it needs to be recognized that there are trade offs to consider - hence the conflict. I think the radical view of eliminating all ties will throw the baby out with the bathwater. On the other hand the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry has to regain some lost public trust, and that might entail eliminating not only true conflicts of interest but the appearance of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accusation of potential conflict of interest easily turns into a witch hunt, however, and can be used as a weapon - where the mere accusation of conflict is equated with guilt. Legitimate scientific opinions and research is often dismissed because of trivial connections to industry that do not constitute a legitimate conflict (anti vaccinationists are famous for this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “baby” in the bathwater of industry ties includes, in my opinion, CME. There are times when the interests of the industry and of good medicine are in line, and these include educating physicians as to the existence of a new drug and its proper use. There is just as much underprescribing going on in medicine as overprescribing - many patients are losing out on the preventive benefits of proven drugs because of inadequate education. Education is therefore a win-win that we should not casually dispense with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legitimate concern is that industry interests will drive the content of education - but that can be managed without eliminating industry funding. Pharmaceutical companies already have divisions between marketing and research. Educational activities could also be segregated from marketing. Funding for CME activities can be unrestricted. Buffers could also be put into place. For example, funding can only be directed at diseases, not drugs. So a manufacturer of a migraine drug can fund CME into migraine education, but not education about their specific drug. In order to avoid hand-picking academics known to be favorable to their products, perhaps funding can be restricted to departments, who then can decide which individuals will provide the content. In other words - the content of the CME needs to be buffered from industry influence. If the industry wants to pay for CME activities, they have to allow academics to completely determine the content. They will do this (and already do in many cases) because there are many win-win situations where increasing education and awareness helps everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and many others also think it is important to allow acadmics to consult for industry researchers. This is a vital flow of experience and information from those on the cutting edge or in the trenches of practice to the industry, to help guide future research and spawn innovation. If academics become paranoid about any industry ties, however, they will be reluctant to provide the industry with their expertise, and patients will ultimately suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently in a transitional phase. Conflicts of interest in the system are being exposed and purged, but this is also leading to a bit of a “witch hunt” mentality and risks purging the good with the bad just for the simplicity of having a clean slate. Hopefully in the end we will settle on a balanced and nuanced system, where legitimate conflicts are exposed and eliminated, but constructive collaboration between academia and industry is allowed to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the playing field needs to be leveled. Right now there is a asymmetry where accusations of conflict are targetted at some industries (like the pharmaceutical industry) far more than others (like the supplement, malpractice, and CAM industries) - even though in many cases conflicts of interest in these latter industries are far worse than what it being criticized in the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we develop a sophisticated system for revealing and minimizing conflicts of interest, the system needs to be applied fairly and universally - not selectively, politically, or punitively.&lt;/p&gt;

It functions as a kind of gratuitous self-affirmation regarding consistency over time, and a pre-emptive defense to any possible charge of flip-flopping.  The habit has spawned what appears to me to be an entirely new construction.  The spokesman for UK prime minister Gordon Brown said yesterday (in a defensive response to something the governor of the Bank of England had said about Britain being unable to afford another round of debt-fueled stimulus to the economy): "We have been clear that we will do whatever it takes to see us through the global downturn."  It seems to me that this is almost entirely a feature of minister-speak, and to a lesser extent corporate-speak ("Certainly Microsoft is a well-respected and successful company and we have been clear that we are fully prepared to do a deal with them", said a Yahoo! release recently).  Lots of people think (ever since Orwell's "Politics and the English language") they are highly sensitive to new developments of government and business jargon.  Yet I don't believe that "We have been clear that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; has been discussed in language forums before (I could be wrong).  Despite all the grumbling about newfangled clichés (often not so newfangled), when a new syntactic construction limited to organizational jargon comes along, apparently people don&amp;#39;t spot it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

The entry is on &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=264"&gt;UFOs and the Argument from Ignorance&lt;/a&gt;. He begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to take your article seriously when it is chock full of unoriginal and regurgitated errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. “There isn’t one unambiguous photograph or video that holds up to scientific scrutiny”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your source on this? There are many photographs and videos that show no sign of tampering or fraud. What sort of “scientific scrutiny” would you require for a photo to be genuine? If it wasn’t proven to be digitally altered, you would claim it was a model or an item thrown into the air. In short, there is no photo in the world that cannot be debunked, but your statement that no unambiguous photo or video holds up to scientific scrutiny is blatantly false (what you are really saying is “if it is a photo of a flying saucer, then by definition it is a fraud”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that is not what I am saying at all. Gimble here is trying to shift the burden of proof - make it my job to prove a negative, the absence of compelling evidence. Rather, if Gimble wishes to claim that there is an unambiguous photograph or other piece of evidence that has survived careful scrutiny - name it.  He didn’t, he just vaguely claims that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also trying the circular reasoning gambit - claiming that I and skeptics declare a-priori that any photo of a flying saucer must by definition be fake, therefore there are no legitimate photos. This is a straw man, we do no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will happily expand upon my criteria for an unambiguous and genuine photo. Regarding the genuine criterion, Gimble only mentions ruling out digital manipulation.  This is necessary, but insufficient. The raw files if digital, or the original negatives if traditional photography was used, are also necessary. A second hand photo is not sufficient. Further, to be compelling a series of photos is helpful, since it is more difficult to fake a series than one photo. For video, the original film in its entirely is needed. Selected clips can cherry pick and eliminate any “gotchas” or obvious signs of fakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For either photos or video, I also want to know the history - who took the pictures, where, and when. Anonymous material immediately loses credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also the photos must be unambiguous as to their content.  This means that a blob of light or a fuzzy disc or metal glint is not compelling. I want to see a spaceship - a picture of something that can be nothing else. If the picture can be explained by a model that someone tossed into the air, then there is no reason to reject that as a possible explanation. A piece of something demonstrably alien would also be compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify what I meant by the claim that there are no such pieces of evidence - I have never seen any, despite being interested in UFOs for my entire life and looking deeply at the claims. Also for the last 13 years I have been an activist skeptic and I have challenged many many UFO believers to show me their best evidence, or point me in the direction of the compelling piece of evidence - and no one ever has. These days with the internet and Youtube, if there were truly compelling evidence I would think that I would have seen it hundreds of times online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is self evident that there is no piece of verified and unambiguous evidence for visiting alien spacecraft known to the public. There tons of poor quality or ambiguous evidence, but nothing compelling. If anyone thinks there is - show me and I will happily revise my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. “not one piece of physical evidence. No smoking saucer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens do not hand out trinkets, that’s true, and neither do they sit in for book signings. Some phenomenon are not given to tangible “in my hands” evidence (although there is loads of trace evidence). Show me your physcial evidence for a supernova and I’ll show you mine for a flying saucer. I’ve got multiple and independent eyewitness testimony (in the millions) spanning several decades across the globe with trace evidence and excellent photos to boot. No evidence? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ironic that Gimble accuses me of being unoriginal. Here he is using the “ten foot stack” gambit. He thinks that if he piles up cowdung high enough it will turn into gold - but large amounts of poor quality evidence do not equal high quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice here also that he is employing a bit of the kettle defense - simultaneously using mutually incompatible arguments. Above he says that there is high quality evidence. Now he is saying that even if there isn’t, there is tons of low quality evidence. If he is being honest in point number 2, he should have conceded point number 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He combines this, as usual, with the “aliens don’t hand out trinkets” gambit. In other words - “it is the nature of my mysterious phenomenon that it defies traditional scientific evidence, therefore I am relieved of the responsibility for supplying traditional scientific evidence - but here is a ton of low quality unscientific evidence.” File this under special pleading (the logical fallacies are piling up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be true that a real phenomenon defies scientific evidence - but then we cannot conclude that it is true, only unknown. Of course, we can invent an infinite number of special cases of things that can be real but unverifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh - and evidence for supernova? Please. There are multiple independent lines of verifiable and reproducible evidence for supernova. Just type “supernova” and “evidence” into Google and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=supernova+evidence&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;see what you get&lt;/a&gt;.  We can see the light and the gamma rays from supernova. Our models of supernova make predictions we can test with further observations. The light from supernova reflect off of distant gas clouds, and we can see those reflections. There’s no comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. “In 1947, pilot Kenneth Arnold started the modern flying saucer craze when he reported seeing several UFOs. He described them as boomerang-shaped, but also noted that they were hopping, like a saucer skipping on the water”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Kenneth Arnold described only ONE of the craft as crescent-shaped with a hole in the middle. Listen to his own words: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zossm96Jb0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s immaterial to your (lifted) argument anyway. The sightings of “saucers” and “disks” after Arnold’s sightings came in a variety of forms, and even the popular “flying saucer” that comes to mind cannot adequately be described as a “plate” - it looks more like a tophat or a football. I’ve yet to read about a flying “plate”, which is what people would have reported if they took the term “saucer” literally as you claim and were simply lying about their reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the strategy of raising trivial and unimportant objections that do not address the actual point. Whether or not Arnold described one or all the object as boomerang shaped is not important. It is important that his sightings did not comport with the later traditional image of a “flying saucer” and that the term “flying saucer” was coined by a reporter who keyed in on one word Arnold used - to describe how the objects moved, not their shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gimble’s next point is just silly - if people took the “flying saucer” description literally they would have described plate - shaped ships? What? These are ships, so apparently they have to have an interior. There is also a bias toward aerodynamic shapes when thinking of ships. Further, I never argued that the shape was taken literally from the description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point, actually, is that the notion of a flying saucer and the accompanying shape that the term evokes is a cultural construct.  It was certainly inspired by the term “flying saucer” but also had other cultural influences. It is also not surprising that at the beginning the modern UFO craze there were many types of reports, but that eventually they settled upon the standard type. The same exact thing is true of aliens themselves. Initially there were dozens of varying descriptions, but the little gray aliens emerged as the standard type, then that became what everyone was reporting. That is culture at work - which was my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Gimble makes the very common strawman argument that I am claiming all eyewitnesses are lying about their reports. I was very specific in saying that it was suggestibility that led to the commonality of reports. Deliberate hoaxing is probably a small component of the UFO phenomenon. Most of it is wishful thinking, perceptual illusion, and sloppy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His next claim is priceless. &lt;img src="http://www.clearskies.se/Tavla%20Venus%20halo%20&amp;amp;%20Jordsken.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="218"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. “Venus may also sport a halo, giving it an even more unusual appearance. (This is likely the source of President Jimmy Carter’s UFO sighting.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Venus was the bogus debunking nonsense of Robert Sheaffer from Humanist magazine, but Carter described the UFO as at times being as “big as the moon” in his official report. (When is Venus ever as large as the moon?)http://www.ufoevidence.org/Cases/CaseSubarticle.asp?ID=297&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is Venus ever as large as the moon? When it is sporting a halo. Gimble obviously did not read the very sentence he quotes.  Nor does he have the patience or Google chops, apparently, to punch “Venus halo” into the search window. The third hit is this: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=supernova+evidence&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;a picture of Venus with a halo and the moon in the same shot&lt;/a&gt;. Gee - venus with a halo is just about the same size as the moon. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. “Proponents of the “extra-terrestrial hypothesis” (ETH) often point out that there is a residue of unexplained sightings, occurrences that can only be due to real flying saucers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They CAN only be flying saucers when that is what is observed ha. And they have been seen up-close many many times. Check out this National Press Club transcript for credible sightings from an ex-governor, pilots, military officers, a division chief for the FAA, and other highly credible witnesses of close encounters of the second kind: http://www.ufo-blog.com/pdf/npc_witness_testimony.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence is a tautology - he is assuming his conclusion. The whole point is that we do not know what eyewitnesses saw, and neither do they. Eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable - there are numerous visual illusions at play. Separate objects may be perceived as one large object. Objects in the sky, without clear reference, can appear to be far away and large when they are in fact close up and small. People are suggestible, and will also happily fill in missing details according to their assumptions. And - people lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are witnesses who claim to have seen flying saucers. My point is that such reports are compatible with the “psychocultural hypothesis” - we would have them even if UFOs were purely a cultural and psychological phenomenon. Without corroborating evidence, there is no more reason to believe in aliens than ghosts, bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, fairies, or any of the other myriad things people seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gimble also makes an argument from authority - saying that pilots and politicians have also been eyewitnesses. But pilots are subject to the same illusions and biases as everyone else. Noone is immune to the foibles of human neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I might point out, that Gimble did not address my actual point - unexplained is unexplained, not alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. “Sometimes people do report details, like windows or fins. They also report objects moving at fantastic speeds or carrying out seemingly impossible maneuvers. However, when viewing an object against the sky, without a clear background for reference, it is impossible to estimate size, distance, and speed, and we are subject to optical illusions. Such details are therefore not reliable, and there are numerous cases when they are demonstrably wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes no sense. If a person says “I saw a metallic object fly away at impossible speeds”, then that is what they saw. If they say, “I’m not sure what it was, but it flashed and bobbed in the air and seemed to move oddly”, then THAT is what they saw. The former is a definite sighting of a UFO, the latter is just an “unknown”. People report sighting UFOs all the time in unequivocal terms and they are not “unknowns” as if ambiguous or uncertain as to observation just because they are listed under the category of “unknown” on paper. People see flying saucers, not optical illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a free tip - if you want to have a shred of credibility, you should acknowledge legitimate points on the other side. Gimble and other UFO apologists should just admit that eyewitnesses are unreliable. Afterall, there is a mountain of psychology research to support this conclusion. It is profoundly naive to claim that if someone says they saw a spaceship, we can confidently conclude that they saw a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are suggestible. Memory is malleable. Perception is highly flawed. And people are emotional, not rational, creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone claims they saw a metallic object fly away at incredible speeds - they may have been looking at a shiny (not metallic) small object moving away at slow speeds, but their brain contructed the ambiguous visual simuli incorrectly - that is the definition of an optical illusion. This is a known and common phenomenon. Alien spacecraft are not. See - Occam’s Razor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. “Air Force pilots mistake common objects for UFOs all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bologna. What is your source on this? Pilots may from time to time wonder if some distant object is a UFO, but they are not certain of it unless they are close enough to observe it (and often they are and do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/foia/ufos.html"&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/a&gt; was able to identify 95% of reported UFO sightings as mundane objects or events.  Many of those reports came from pilots. There are also many case reports of pilots reporting UFOs that were later identified as definitely or probably an astronomical phenomenon. &lt;a href="http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/astroufo1.htm"&gt;Here is a good report&lt;/a&gt; of many such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. “But curiosity must be coupled with intellectual discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are under the false impression that most witnesses jump to the conclusion that an unknown object in the sky is a flying saucer. This is not true. J. Allen Hynek coined a term for how witnesses behave when they see a UFO - “escalation of hypotheses”. The first thing they do is try to rationalize their experience - “maybe it’s a bird? no can’t be that… maybe a plane? a meteorite?” and so on. Despite the claims of snobbery debunkers, most people do not in fact “try” to see UFOs - they do the opposite! and only reach that conclusion when other explanations have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we can easily generalize to what “most people” do. It’s likely that there is a range of reactions to an unusual sighting. But even if I grant that most people will consider likely explanations first, that is not in contradiction to what I am saying. I never claimed that they fail to consider any alternatives - but rather they they settle prematurely onto flying saucers as a likely explanation. In most cases the only logically justified conclusion is unknown, not flying saucer. That was, in fact, the central theme of my original post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have personally had many encounters with eyewitnesses who, excited by the possibility of something cool or mysterious, will reject a few token mundane explanations, and then (very prematurely) conclude that the object must have either been alien or something equally fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. “We should be aware of the limitations of our own observations and memory, the human tendency toward suggestibility and wishful thinking, and the dictates of logic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why are you not doing so? Wishful thinking is putting your fingers in your ears and saying “the world must make sense to me; there cannot be flying saucers; aliens must behave the way I think they should; the world must make sense to me”. By discounting the volumes of evidence over 6 decades, debunkers do indeed show a high proclivity for suggestibility - namely that they will pull arguments from a common pool of tossed-about non-facts instead of actually doing some independent reading on their own. For REAL skeptics, I suggest reading one of these books from researchers who have actually talked to witnesses, rather than some doofus who has no idea what he’s talking about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the typical UFO believer (even generalizable to paranormal believer) straw man about skeptics - that we are deniers who do not want to confront evidence that will shake our fragile world view. Strawman argument are worthless - if you want to understand and confront the position of skeptics you have to read what they actually write and address their actual points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never said that aliens are impossible. Nor have I ever said that aliens must be completely comprehensible. Ironically, it is the skeptics who are arguing, as I was in my original piece, that sometimes we just don’t have enough evidence to know what a sighting was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is likely that there is life elsewhere in the universe and that some of that life is intelligent and even technological. I have no idea how common or uncommon technological civilizations are - no one does.  I also don’t know if advanced technology will ever render interstellar travel practical, or if there are fundamental limitations in the laws of physics that will make it forever impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a benign advanced alien race visited the earth that would be incredibly awesome. It would answer many burning questions. I would love just to see what an alien intelligence might be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position, as I have made clear, is that taken as a whole the evidence is far more compatible with the psychocultural hypothesis than the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and there is no single piece of evidence that demands the ETH. But I am happy to be proven wrong - just show me the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gimble, although I am picking on him because he decided to leave a comment on my blog, presents views that are typical of the core UFO community. I have heard them all many times before. UFO believers attack straw men, completely mischaracterize the position of UFO skeptics, fail to address the skeptical position, and find many ways to argue that their low quality evidence should be taken more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they never ever do, however, is refute my claims that compelling evidence does not exist by simply providing such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we go out to get our mail right now, there are hundreds of &lt;a href="http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/entomology/factsheets/clusterf.html"&gt;cluster flies&lt;/a&gt; all over the front steps and yard.  They create a low droning hum and swarm all around as you walk.  &lt;a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/242317/bgimage"&gt;&lt;img title="cluster_flies1" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/cluster_flies1.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;h=86" alt="cluster_flies1" width="128" height="86"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, the &lt;a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/br/article/470777/amityville-horror-remake-backed-flyridden-online-ad-push/"&gt;Amityville house was plagued by swarms of flies&lt;/a&gt; despite the winter weather  (December/January).   What that tells &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; is that they had &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/ask-an-entomologist-cluster-flies/"&gt;Cluster Flies&lt;/a&gt;.  These flies get their name from their habit of clustering in attics or near windows. (Sound familiar, Amity fans?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amityville house had been previously unoccupied for over a year. When the Lutz family moved in and turned the heat on, conditions were perfect to trigger a massive cluster fly emergence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cluster flies find shelter from the winter by crawling under your siding or in foundation cracks. When you turn on the heat that warms the flies up, and they find a way inside via electrical outlets, baseboards, or door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No satanic mystery for the sudden fly emergence at all.  In fact, the flies might be the only &lt;a title="CSICOP" href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2003-01/amityville.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; part of the Amityville story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you want to asplode your head, read this &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081012175545AAoEu6a"&gt;Yahoo Answers page&lt;/a&gt; discussing “are flies linked to paranormal activity?”  &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to the Bug House and our massive clusterfuck fly problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMGWTFGHOSTS? Um, no. Worms, actually.&lt;br&gt;
Although they are blowfly relatives, cluster flies are not carrion flies, but a type of fly parasitic on earthworms. They are harmless, and do not carry any human diseases.  They are, however, annoying as hell, and &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/apostrofly/"&gt;poop all over everything&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I normally just vacuum them up, this year I might have to do something. I don’t want to scare potential home buyers away with a giant roaring wall of (harmless) flies.  I really don’t want to spray for something so cosmetic, though.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

The prize was first awarded back in 1992, when I visited Hungary, and has continued since, though with a few gaps because the journal did not find applicants of sufficient talent to justify the award. That principle - granting an award only when it's justified - is the way such matters should be handled.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a book series that focuses on a particular aspect of science in each volume. The covers are so great and inspiring that I thought it would be fun to do a tribute / spoof of one of those covers for our book. So I refrenced one of the covers I really enjoyed and tried to stay true to the format, color, and typography styling. Obviously the edition that I did the cover to is a bit racy for the series, but I think it would be a best seller if it were included.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="sexnscience_s.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/sexnscience_s.jpg" width="450" height="587"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to big brother Dez (animator extraordinaire at &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://ttgames.com/"&gt;Traveller's Tales&lt;/a&gt;) for the link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/sex_science_amazing_concept_ar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237969004716"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_243.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0173b0f2cebd94c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-25T08:56:36Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T08:56:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Fwv8pBWal28/clock_quotes_243.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_243.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few men during their lifetime come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them.

The &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/03/24/autism-research-gets-stimulus-money-for-a-short-term-boost/"&gt;WSJ Health Blog&lt;/a&gt; recently noted that the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; is seeking to "kickstart autism research with $60 million in grant funding from the stimulus bill." Noting that there are "few options for autistic children beyond behavior and diet modifications," the WSJ singles out the possibility of developing medications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only drug on the market for the condition — J &amp;amp; J&amp;#39;s antipsychotic &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/risperdal-drug.htm"&gt;Risperdal&lt;/a&gt; — treats irritability associated with autism, but not the underlying disease. The HHS Interagency Coordinating Committee, which put out the January research plan, likened autism to Alzheimer’s in terms of cost to society, running as high as $90 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Alzheimer’s is a big push right now for drug makers, few if any novel medicines are being tested now by Big Pharma for autism. One industry-supported study, looking at Prozac, failed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm always of at least two minds on the topic of drugs for "treating" autism. My son takes medication (Risperdal and Zoloft) and these help him in some, albeit limited, ways. Medication can be helpful but I think we have to be wary of thinking that there might be some &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/no-magic-pill-for-autism-on-risperdal-and-the-importance-of-autism-education/"&gt;magic pill for autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories like those of Keith Inman strike a cautionary note about what can happen when giving too much medication. Inman had his first epileptic seizure---a ringing telephone was the trigger---in 1967, but was not diagnosed with autism until thirteen years later, his mother, Nila Sunday, notes. In the March 8th &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/9899"&gt;Bloomington Alternative&lt;/a&gt;, Sunday says that it was only after attending an autism conference in Indianapolis in 1980 that she first considered that her son might be autistic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she understood that her son was epileptic and autistic, she approached the Monroe County Schools’ special education director for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘Oh, no, we don’t have any autistic children in Monroe County,’” she said. “… He just blew me off and wouldn’t discuss it with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to receiving an autism diagnosis, doctors primarily focused on treating Inman's seizures with medications, some of which--phenobarbital and Dilantin--made him worse. Inman remained in special education classes until he was 20 during which a teacher who had some training in autism "changed Keith’s life." Unfortunately more difficult times lay ahead for Keith Inman: In his 20s, he was a residential program where some workers were, according to his mother, "'abusive.'" He now lives at the Stone Belt group home in Bloomington and works at different jobs in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about Inman's late diagnosis, one wonders how his life and that of his family might have been different had he been identified while much younger as being autistic? Or, given the time that he lived in and the services available, perhaps the outcome would not have been too different? Based on Nila Sunday's account in the &lt;a href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/9899"&gt;Bloomington Alternative&lt;/a&gt;, knowing earlier about her son's diagnosis would have made a difference; I wonder about how my own son might have been medicated.....I mean, "treated." It doesn't help to learn that, as reported in the March 19th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/us/20psych.html?_r=1&amp;amp;em"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard child psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman told the drug maker Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson that planned studies of its medications----including of the antipsychotic Risperidone---in children (including those of preschool age) &amp;quot;would yield results benefiting the company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all gives you some historical perspective about how things could have been; about how, though it's not always easy, things today are (a bit) better. Let's make sure the powers that be at the NIH have this in mind in allocating those $60 million in research funds for autism.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237960066674"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2008">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f66a6a421b35988</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Oldstone letter in the Omnibus docket</title><published>2009-03-25T01:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T01:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/rcyCyaZSv6Q/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237958811500"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_heartless_faith.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59b673826de45262</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evil"/><title type="html">A heartless faith</title><published>2009-03-25T06:52:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T06:52:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/T2auDSwPe7A/a_heartless_faith.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_heartless_faith.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/03/22/2009-03-22_plane_crash_in_montana_cemetery_kills_se.html"&gt;appalling and tragic plane crash in Montana&lt;/a&gt;: 14 people were killed, 7 of them children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Hagler, a mechanic at the Oroville airport, told The Sacramento Bee that he allowed several children ages 6 to 10 to use the airport bathroom before they boarded the doomed plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"There were a lot of kids in the group," he said, "a lot of really cute kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine of them were members of one family.

&lt;p&gt;PZ isn't the only person who gets wingnut comments. I get 'em too, and yesterday I got a doozy from a guy named Keith Dunlop in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/jeremy_sherr_using_homeopathy_for_aids.php#comment-1498193"&gt;response to my post&lt;/a&gt; about a homepath bringing his quackery to poor AIDS patients in Africa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;THE MAIN POST ABOVE IS FROM A DRUG COMPANY MASQUERADING AS CONCERNED SCIENCE. THIS IS NON OTHER THAN AN ATTEMPT BY THE DIRTY TRICKS DEPARTMENT OF A DRUGS COMPANY TO MINIMIZE RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF TREATING THIS PHENOMENA FOR THE SAKE OF EVIL AND PURE PROFIT.

&lt;p&gt;MR SHERR HAS BEEN HOUNDED, VILIFIED, THREATENED, FOLLOWED AND COWED BY THE BIG PHARMA FRONT PEOPLE WHO HAS POSTED THIS, WHO CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED AND OPERATE UNDER ANY NUMBER OF "FALSE FRONTS".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE DRUG COMPANY POSTING THIS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF AND HOPE THAT THEY ARE NEVER REVEALED. THIS IS THE NEW AGE OF WITCH HUNTING - ONLY ITS CORPORATE DRIVEN. THEY SEEK TO DISCREDIT ANY GENUINE AND CONCERNED ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORT OR ALTERNATIVE NATURAL TREATMENT. DIRTY TRICKS DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INDUSTRIAL PHARMA ARE THE DIRTIEST MOST LOW LYING SCUMBAG SET OF PEOPLE AND WE ARE ON TO YOU. BE CAREFUL. AND STOP HARASSING PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU ARE PARALYTICALLY SCARED THAT SOMEONE WILL FIND A COST FREE WAY TO TREAT AIDS AND RENDER YOUR MULTI BILLION OPERATIONS USELESS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STICK TO YOUR BIZ JETS AND MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PROFITS. AND PRAY THERE IS NO POWER ABOVE AS YOU WILL SURELY ROT IN HELL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this post particularly amusing after &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/catherine_deangelis_and_jama.php"&gt;yesterday's massive rant&lt;/a&gt; against JAMA and its failure to pollce an obvious big pharma conflict of interest, so much so that I giggled when I read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I keep wondering where my massive checks and business jets are as payment for my servile pharma blogging. Sadly, somehow they never materialize. Come on, pharma! Aren't my attacks on homeopathy worth something? Anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on, can't I at least have a ride in the black helicopter?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/i_get_comments_too.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/QQM6QB8aF2k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237955899036"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2636">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c87f8ce0989047d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="A Haunting in Connecticut"/><category term="Ed Warren"/><category term="Ghost Hunters"/><category term="ghosts"/><category term="Lorraine Warren"/><title type="html">Connecticut family haunted by ghost enthusiasts</title><published>2009-03-25T04:37:29Z</published><updated>2009-03-25T04:37:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/connecticut-family-haunted-by-ghost-enthusiasts/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="saps-taps-parody" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/saps-taps-parody.jpg?w=200&amp;amp;h=212" alt="saps-taps-parody" width="200" height="212"&gt;On Friday, another stupid horror movie about ghosts that’s touting itself as being “based on a true story” (you know, in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; was based on the true story of ideas that came out of George Lucas’ head or &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Storm&lt;/em&gt; was based on a true story of what happened on a boat where there were no survivors to tell the tale) hits theaters. The film is called&lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Haunting in Connecticut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090322/ap_on_re_us/haunting_in_connecticut_2"&gt;But the family that lives in the  house the film is said to be based on are being haunted by something a lot scarier than fairytale spectres&lt;/a&gt;, credulous ghost enthusiasts eager to spot a ghost. And it doesn’t seem to matter to them that the family living in the house has never encountered any paranormal phenomena because, of course, they’re not delusional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just been really, really stressful,” said Susan Trotta-Smith, who bought the home 10 years ago with her husband. “It’s been a total change from a very quiet house in a very quiet neighborhood to looking out the window and seeing cars stopping all the time. It’s been very, very stressful, and sometimes worrisome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family has never seen anything unusual inside their five-bedroom, two-family white wood-frame house and does not believe the property was haunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original account of ghosts comes from the family that lived in the house in the 1980’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The residents at the time, the &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Snedeker family&lt;/span&gt;, claimed their son would hear strange noises in his basement bedroom, which once held casket displays and was near the old embalming room. He also claimed to see shadows on the wall of people who were not there. A niece visiting the home said she felt hands on her body as she tried to sleep, and her covers levitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family brought in &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Ed and Lorraine Warren&lt;/span&gt;, self-described paranormal researchers, who became famous for documenting the alleged “&lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc"&gt;Amityville Horror&lt;/span&gt;” haunting of a home on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lorraine Warren&lt;/span&gt; says she felt an evil presence in the Southington home and experienced the haunting herself when she spent a night there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, it wouldn’t be a haunting without the grandparents of ghostly woo themselves, Ed and Lorraine Warren. These 2 con artis–err, I mean paranormal investigators are almost single-handedly responsible for all the modern day ghost hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

it is really helpful to people, so they keep sending me questions; and as usual, I do my best to try to answer them. Even if I don't particularly enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004984" title=""&gt;Light-Induced Fos Expression in Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells in Melanopsin Knockout (Opn4−/−) Mice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and exhibit robust synaptically driven ON-responses to light, yet they will continue to depolarize in response to light when all synaptic input from rod and cone photoreceptors is removed. The light-evoked increase in firing of classical ganglion cells is determined by synaptic input from ON-bipolar cells in the proximal sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. OFF-bipolar cells synapse with ganglion cell dendrites in the distal sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. Of the several types of ipRGC that have been described, M1 ipRGCs send dendrites exclusively into the OFF region of the inner plexiform layer where they stratify near the border of the inner nuclear layer. We tested whether M1 ipRGCs with dendrites restricted to the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer receive synaptic ON-bipolar input by examining light-induced gene expression in vivo using melanopsin knockout mice. Mice in which both copies of the melanopsin gene (opn4) have been replaced with the tau-lacZ gene (homozygous tau-lacZ+/+ knockin mice) are melanopsin knockouts (opn4−/−) but M1 ipRGCs are specifically identified by their expression of β-galactosidase. Approximately 60% of M1 ipRGCs in Opn4−/− mice exposed to 3 hrs of light expressed c-Fos; no β-galactosidase-positive RGCs expressed c-Fos in the dark. Intraocular application of L-AP4, a compound which blocks transmission of visual signals between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells significantly reduced light-evoked c-Fos expression in M1 ipRGCs compared to saline injected eyes (66% saline vs 27% L-AP4). The results are the first description of a light-evoked response in an ipRGC lacking melanopsin and provide in vivo confirmation of previous in vitro observations illustrating an unusual circuit in the retina in which ganglion cells sending dendrites to the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer receive excitatory synaptic input from ON-bipolar cells.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004999" title=""&gt;A Chromosomal Inversion Unique to the Northern White-Cheeked Gibbon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gibbon family belongs to the superfamily Hominoidea and includes 15 species divided into four genera. Each genus possesses a distinct karyotype with chromosome numbers varying from 38 to 52. This diversity is the result of numerous chromosomal changes that have accumulated during the evolution of the gibbon lineage, a quite unique feature in comparison with other hominoids and most of the other primates. Some gibbon species and subspecies rank among the most endangered primates in the world. Breeding programs can be extremely challenging and hybridization plays an important role within the factors responsible for the decline of captive gibbons. With less than 500 individuals left in the wild, the northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys leucogenys, NLE) is the most endangered primate in a successful captive breeding program. We present here the analysis of an inversion that we show being specific for the northern white-cheeked gibbon and can be used as one of the criteria to distinguish this subspecies from other gibbon taxa. The availability of the sequence spanning for one of the breakpoints of the inversion allows detecting it by a simple PCR test also on low quality DNA. Our results demonstrate the important role of genomics in providing tools for conservation efforts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004983" title=""&gt;Physiological Stress Mediates the Honesty of Social Signals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Extravagant ornaments used as social signals evolved to advertise their bearers' quality. The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis proposes that testosterone-dependent ornaments reliably signal health and parasite resistance; however, empirical studies have shown mixed support. Alternatively, immune function and parasite resistance may be indirectly or directly related to glucocorticoid stress hormones. We propose that an understanding of the interplay between the individual and its environment, particularly how they cope with stressors, is crucial for understanding the honesty of social signals. We analyzed corticosterone deposited in growing feathers as an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in a wild territorial bird, the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We manipulated two key, interrelated components, parasites and testosterone, which influence both ornamentation and fitness. Birds were initially purged of parasites, and later challenged with parasites or not, while at the same time being given testosterone or control implants, using a factorial experimental design. At the treatment level, testosterone enhanced ornamentation, while parasites reduced it, but only in males not implanted with testosterone. Among individuals, the degree to which both parasites and testosterone had an effect was strongly dependent on the amount of corticosterone in the feather grown during the experiment. The more stressors birds had experienced (i.e., higher corticosterone), the more parasites developed, and the less testosterone enhanced ornamentation. With this unique focus on the individual, and a novel, integrative, measure of response to stressors, we show that ornamentation is ultimately a product of the cumulative physiological response to environmental challenges. These findings lead toward a more realistic concept of honesty in signaling as well as a broader discussion of the concept of stress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I have been informed by my blogdaughter (I showed her how to get socially networked at an American Astronomical Society meeting last year!) Alice that her blog &lt;a href="http://www.alicesastroinfo.com/"&gt;Alice’s AstroInfo&lt;/a&gt; has moved to a new URL (that link goes to the current address). So update your links if you haven’t yet, and/or drop her in your feed reader if you haven’t been reading her stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Skepticamp guy Reed Esau tells me that there are two Camps this weekend: &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/SkeptiCampPhoenix2009"&gt;one in Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; (with the truly awesome Michael Stackpole), and &lt;a href="http://www.bcskeptics.info/skepticamp/2009.04.html"&gt;one in Vancouver Canadia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) I’ve mentioned this before, but just a reminder that &lt;a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/"&gt;100 Hours of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; is coming up in early April. Get ready. &lt;/p&gt;

Listen to what Ronald S. Hendel said about Jericho. He's a Professor of Hebrew Bible and Jewish Studies in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;amp;Volume=35&amp;amp;Issue=02&amp;amp;ArticleID=05&amp;amp;Page=0&amp;amp;UserID=0&amp;amp;"&gt;This is what he said matter-of-factly:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the best interpretations of the archaeological evidence, Jericho was destroyed around 1550 B.C.E. and was not settled again until after 1000 B.C.E. But the emergence of Israel dates to around 1200 B.C.E., right in the middle of this 500-year gap. &lt;strong&gt;If Joshua and his troops had surrounded Jericho, there would have been nobody home.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Then Hendel goes on to try to salvage some kind of historicity to the story itself involving mythical giants in the land, whom it was believed were sired from the sons of god mating with women (Genesis 6). But one myth cannot be used to lend credibility to another one. He may be correct about what the Israelites believed, but I see no reason to accept any of this as historical at all. Apparently there were a number of these giants in the land--even &lt;em&gt;Goliath &lt;/em&gt;was one of them. Where are the archaeological digs revealing any of the skeletal remains of even one of these giants? Again, there are none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian, does this not trouble you? It should. Such a lack of evidence as this is the same thing we find when it comes to the Mormon claims of people living in America that form the basis of the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;. You don't believe the Mormons precisely because of this lack of archaeological evidence. Why then do you not apply this same kind of evidential test when it comes to your own beliefs? This is what it means to take &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/outsider-test-for-faith_20.html"&gt;The Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science and religion deal with different things. Science tries to figure out how things work and religion teaches about morality and spirituality. There doesn't need to be a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete bullshit. I'd rather get my morality from reason and real world experience, from &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt;, and religion teaches &lt;b&gt;nothing&lt;/b&gt; about morality. Religion is about obedience to arbitrary rules. As for spirituality — I don&amp;#39;t need a cult to teach me about the nonexistent and irrelevant. Then last year, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/mixed_messages_from_the_nas.php"&gt;NAS came out with the same nonsense&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science and Religion Offer Different Ways of Understanding the World&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Science and religion address separate aspects of human experience. Many scientists have written eloquently about how their scientific studies of biological evolution have enhanced rather than lessened their religious faith. And many religious people and denominations accept the scientific evidence for evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this kind of conciliatory and entirely false cliched position that major proponents of better science education tend to take — because it&amp;#39;s popular, they pretend that religion is the gentle, benign bit of fluff that has some vague utility in making people better. It&amp;#39;s a lie told to calm the ignorant…the ignorant who will then turn about and obligingly stick a knife in our efforts to improve science, all in the name of their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never understood it. It simply grants religion an unquestioned privileged place as an equal to science, when it deserves no such prestige. Why aren't these pro-science organizations going out of their way to say, "Science and literature deal with different things" or "Science and Art Offer Different Ways of Understanding the World"? At least then they'd be saying something true.  At least then they wouldn't be promoting a damaging delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not a lonely voice crying out my frustration to an unheeding world, I'm pleased to say. I've heard from many fellow scientists who feel the same way. &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/"&gt;Larry Moran has always been vocal about the same problem&lt;/a&gt;. And of course we've got those cranky New Atheists busily publishing their demolitions of the validity of faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add another big name: &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/must-we-always-cater-to-the-faithful-when-teaching-science/"&gt;Jerry Coyne is making a similar argument&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that we can defend evolution without having to cater to the faithful at the same time. Why not just show that evolution is TRUE and its alternatives are not? Why kowtow to those whose beliefs many of us find unpalatable, just to sell our discipline?  There are, in fact, two disadvantages to the "cater-to-religion" stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By trotting out those "religious scientists", like Ken Miller, or those "scientific theologians," like John Haught, we are tacitly putting our imprimatur on their beliefs, including beliefs that God acts in the world today (theism), suspending natural laws.  For example, I don't subscribe to Miller's belief that God acts immanently in the world, perhaps by influencing events on the quantum level, or  that God created the laws of physics so that human-containing planets could evolve.  I do not agree with John Haught's theology.  I do not consider any faith that touts God's intervention in the world (even in the past) as compatible with science.  Do my colleagues at the NAS or the NCSE disagree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement that learning evolution does not influence one's religious belief is palpably false.  There are plenty of statistics that show otherwise, including the negative correlation of scientific achievement with religious belief and the negative correlation among nations in degree of belief in God with degree of acceptance of evolution.  All of us know this, but we pretend otherwise.  (In my book I note that "enlightened" religion can be compatible with science, but by "englightened" I meant a complete, hands-off deism.)  I think it is hypocrisy to pretend that learning evolution will not affect either the nature or degree of one's faith.  It doesn't always, but it does more often than we admit, and there are obvious reasons why (I won't belabor these).  I hate to see my colleagues pretending that faith and science live in nonoverlapping magisteria.  They know better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk compatibility with science, atheism is a far better fit to the evidence. It is ridiculous that we still try to link evolution and science education to an airily nebulous version of inoffensive religion that virtually no one accepts, and isn't even a reasonable model of the way the universe actually works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_heathen_are_raging_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tDqc-YV4jWM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237935660503"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/blasting_stereotypes_in_autistic_females">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bda53dd7b8359e66</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Blasting Stereotypes in Autistic Females</title><published>2009-03-24T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/blasting_stereotypes_in_autistic_females" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodsardine-clean/445373395/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/209/445373395_b294770a5c_m.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It's no secret that more males than females are diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. Evidence shows that there are differing behaviors between autistic males and females. Some feel the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorders, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV"&gt;DSM IV&lt;/a&gt;, has neglected to address this important issue. I suspect &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Baron-Cohen"&gt;Dr. Simon Baron Cohen's&lt;/a&gt; theory of autism being a form of an "extreme male brain" may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people question if autism is really different in females than it is in males, I find myself thrown back into a nice neat square box from which it seems there is no escape. Dr. Cohen, however, has stated that we shouldn't assume autism or Asperger syndrome will look the same in both sexes. This is no moot point, as there are a lot of females who are either passed over, or denied a diagnosis, due to the lack of sensitivity in regards to ferreting out the unique and succinct differences related to how autism may present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1836&amp;amp;a=17258"&gt;Dr. Judith Gould&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=10"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt;, states that characteristics such as shyness and over-sensitivity, common in autistic people, are sometimes deemed to be typically female traits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuroscience/Page.php?ID=12&amp;amp;ResearcherID=180"&gt;David Skuse&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatry professor from Institute of Child Health at University College London adds that because girls' general aptitude for communication and their social competence helps some Aspergers girls "pass"--they pick up on their difference and carefully mask it by mimicking other girls' speech, manner, and dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an autistic female, I can identify and attest to Dr. Skuse's commentary, as it is true in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I disclose my diagnosis as an autistic person, it is not uncommon for me to hear these types of remarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You seem so with it! Matter of fact, I have always admired how together you seem to have everything."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I am thinking about how shattered someone's image of me would be if only they knew how dysfunctional, cantankerous, and unreliable my executive functioning skills are. I conjur images of people visiting me at my home and becoming alarmed at my sudden change in behavior if anything is set out of place. Also mentionable, is my incessant staring off into space, trying to remember what it is that I was, or am supposed to be, doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But you speak so well and seem to have so much going for you! You seem so articulate and thorough. Gosh, I would never have known!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear these types of comments, which are often well-intentioned, it is reiterated that autism myths--including what autistic people should look and act like--need to be stamped out for good. It is important to realize that autistic people possess uneven skills. For example, being articulate, wearing make-up, and dressing in clothes that I think are fashionable, does NOT mean that I have it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't we all been warned not to judge books by their covers? Simply put, casually pointing fingers--or not--at autism is a subjective business.&lt;/p&gt;

Creationists, whether &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/dp" rel="external "&gt;YECs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/darwin-reader-darwins-racism/" rel="external "&gt;IDers&lt;/a&gt;, just can’t help falling over themselves in their eagerness to tar the theory of evolution (and Darwin) as racist. This is nonsense for any number of historical reasons. Racism obviously had existed long before Darwin. Darwin, though he sometimes expressed statements that are racist by modern standards, was remarkably non-racist by the standards of his age and treated people of other races without prejudice, as well as being passionately opposed to slavery (he was far less racist than most Christians and creationists of the time). It’s true that evolution was pressed into service to provide justification for racism, but &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/racism.html" rel="external "&gt;the same could be said of Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. Such arguments were invalid and are not a logical consequence of evolution. &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth/hitler-eugenics" rel="external "&gt;Nor is there any truth&lt;/a&gt; to the smears that evolution caused the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the strangest thing about creationists trying to link evolution and racism is that creationists generally &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; some of the theory of evolution. Not all of it obviously, but the major creationist organizations all accept the idea of natural selection and evolution within ‘kinds’ (a non-scientific creationist term that, in practice, is defined to be whatever amount of evolution creationists are willing to accept). Answers in Genesis even enthusiastically affirms that &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2009/03/12/where-darwin-got-it-right-natural-selection" rel="external "&gt;it has no problem with the concept of natural selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists don’t accept that evolutionary change can accumulate indefinitely and that humans could have evolved from apes or earlier primitive animals, but that’s not the scale of change involved in the evolution of all living humans from their most recent common ancestors. Human racial differences are minor and easily explained by natural selection. To creationists, humans are a ‘kind’, and human races evolved within that kind. So if the theory of evolution is racist, that makes creationism equally racist.
&lt;/p&gt;

Harvey Burnett recently asked me this question: &lt;blockquote&gt;How much knowledge of the natural universe do you have? What is the percentage? Give me an estimate. I would like to know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The import of such a question is reflected in the title to this post. Some believers think, perhaps Harvey does too, that in order for me to claim a god doesn't exist I need to know all things. Really? This is so laughable I hardly know where to start, but here we go...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I need to have omniscience before I can claim the following things?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) That there are no unicorns, elves, trolls, or hobbits.&lt;br&gt;2) That there is no Santa Claus or Easter bunny.&lt;br&gt;3) That there is no Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Artemis, Juno, Janus, Hermes, Aphrodite, Baal, Asherah, Molech, Ra, Hathor, Osirus, Seth, Horus, Thor, or one of the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Gods-Over-Deities-World/dp/0816029091/ref=ed_oe_h"&gt;2,500 deities of the world&lt;/a&gt;? Logic alone tells me they cannot all exist! &lt;em&gt;Atheism Blog&lt;/em&gt; informs us that at least 500 of these deities &lt;a href="http://atheismblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/dead-gods.html"&gt;are dead&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this J.L. Schellenberg argues that the odds are always going to favor the conclusion that your view is wrong in this situation. There are just too many other gods out there that undermine the probability that you’ve got the right one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I merely mentioned a few things that directly relate to whether I can claim to know the Christian God exists, there are a host of other things I can claim to know without also claiming omniscience. This includes everything I claim to know, as in E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G, since Harvey likes to use capital letters to emphasize things. Even though I do not have omniscience I can still claim to know everything that I claim to know, all of it. And trust me on this, there are degrees of assuredness to the things I claim to know, so when I say I know George Washington was the first President of the United States my assuredness of that fact in the past is always going to be less than my claim that when I drop a book it will fall because of gravity. So along with any knowledge claim there is an implicit assuredness factor that is left unstated. But I could state them for you if you want me too, with some further reflection. This means there is always a probability factor involved in all knowledge claims, and I also have a good grasp of those claims of mine that have a higher level of assuredness to them than other things I claim to know that I am less sure about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when it comes to my denial that the Christian God of the Bible exists I am about as sure of this as I am that George Washington was our first president, since whether or not this God exists is also a historical conclusion regarding the claims that such a God revealed himself in the past--the ancient superstitious past, mind you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in answer to Harvey’s question I know enough to know I don't know that much about the universe, kinda like Socrates who said that the wise person is the one who claims not to know much at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, what I do know tells me there is no creator God, no Holy Spirit, no Trinity, no fall into sin in the Garden of Eden, no universal flood, no Exodus or Canaanite conquest, no prophecy about Jesus that specifically points to him as the Messiah, no virgin birth, no incarnation, no atonement, no resurrection, no ascension into the sky, no future coming of the Son of Man, no great white throne judgment, no Satan, no heaven above nor hell below, and no inspired writings from God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could be wrong about these things though, as Harvey will be quick to say since I've just admitted I don't know much about the universe. Yes, I could be wrong. I admit this. I could be wrong about George Washington too. But I consider what I do know to virtually eliminate that possibility. You cannot drive a truckload of silly hypotheses and ignorant conjectures based upon non-veridical religious experiences through that small hole of a possibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I have a question to ask you Harvey. How much do YOU know about the universe (and I’ll throw in the history of theology, the history of the Bible, the history of the church, apologetics, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy)? ;-) My claim is you don’t know what I do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-4456005652541667322?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I need not go into details — you can find my arguments &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/20/is-obama-going-to-gut-nasa/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/21/nasas-budget-as-far-as-americans-think/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/08/06/neil-tyson-on-exploring-space/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/14/what-value-space-exploration/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  — but let me just say that science always pays off in the long run. Always. And many times in the short run as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in hard economic times, we have to fund research. If we don’t, we make things that much harder on ourselves later. Now please, don’t tell me we can’t afford anything for science, or that I’m asking too much. This argument is not so clearly black and white: I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying we can afford to fund everyone’s research at the levels we do during economic boom times, of course. But unless this country (and in fact the whole world) slides into a vast depression, then we certainly do need to keep some money flowing, even if only at a tighter level, into research. We don’t know what major advance will come out of some medical research, or engineering research, or even space research. So even if we restrict the flow, it’s important to keep at least some flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does mean some research may get funded at the expense of something else, but the last thing we need is squabbling inside the fence of science between projects that are all facing cuts. Doing that poisons the scientific community. And doing it &lt;em&gt;in public&lt;/em&gt; is ugly and extremely bad form, since that cannot help but make the public turn against science in one form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I am particularly unhappy with &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amitai-etzioni/bring-nasa-back-to-earth_b_177328.html"&gt;an editorial in the Huffington Post by Amitai Etzioni&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an attack on NASA, set up as a false dichotomy between space research and ocean research, and uses narrow-minded opinions that I don’t think reflect those of the American public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, Etzioni complains that &lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;the Kepler mission&lt;/a&gt; — designed to look for the signatures of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars — is essentially a waste of money:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA has a very effective propaganda machine. Whatever modest little mission it pursues, it frames as if it was of grand importance not merely to the United States but to the human race. The most recent example is the launch of a telescope which costs a ‘mere’ six hundred million dollars, the immodestly labeled ‘Kepler’ mission. For those who have not kept up with the philosophical implications of their astronomy lessons, Johannes Kepler revolutionized our view of the world by revealing that we are not the center of the universe, that we are among a bunch of other planets which are circling the Sun rather than Mother Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ed Weiler, Head of Science Missions at NASA, told NPR that Kepler “is a historical mission. I maintain it really attacks some very basic questions that have been part of our genetic code since that first man or woman looked up in the sky and asked the question: Are we alone?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could say this is merely one overblown piece of PR, dished out by those who try to justify why they are spending hundred of millions of dollars on projects that will yield very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yield very little&amp;quot;? Dude. Seriously? The question of whether we are alone in the Universe, and even if there are other planets capable of sustaining life, is certainly deeply ingrained in our minds. &lt;em&gt;This is one of the biggest remaining unanswered philosophical questions in science!&lt;/em&gt; For Etzioni to poopoo it is not only insulting, but so egregiously wrong-headed that it boggles my own mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/nasa_v_noaa.jpg" alt="What’s better, Kepler or ocean studies? Neither. They’re both important!"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of big questions in every field of science, but I think asking if there is life in space transcends any one field, if only because the question itself involves so many scientific disciplines: astronomy, geology, biology, physics, and more. And now, for the first time in history, we can make solid progress towards answering that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but Kepler will yield vast amounts of data useful in a lot of astronomical subdisciplines. It’s not like all we’ll get out of it is a simple statistic like, &amp;quot;1 out of every 18 stars has planets&amp;quot;. Any type of survey undertaken in astronomy is incredibly useful in cross-disciplinary work. Perhaps Etzioni should have talked to an astronomer before writing what he did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His basic premise in the HuffPo piece is that we should be spending that money on deep sea research, and not space. This is the false dichotomy I mentioned earlier. Here’s a thought he doesn’t talk about: &lt;em&gt;why not fund both?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, there is not as much money to go around as there used to be, but why suggest we cut off funds for one kind of research to feed another? Sure, oceanography is important, interesting, and could yield economic boons, but so does space exploration. His strawman argument of NASA helping create Teflon is pretty awful; he ignores the impacts of, say, weather satellites, communication satellites, solar weather prediction, the huge benefit computers got from Apollo, and the creation of the digital photography industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you some piffling examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the links I provided at the top of this article for more. And if you think Etzioni is not really attacking NASA — and hurting all of scientific research — in his article, then read how he ends it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, Obama has more urgent priorities than worrying about either outer space or deep oceans. However, presidents have assistants, and they have assistants. Somebody, one cannot but hope, can bring some sense into setting priorities in spending those dollars dedicated to exploration. These may well be dedicated to discovering ways to fight disease and finding sustainable new sources of energy. But do not look for NASA for much help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, to be blunt, ridiculous. Not the first part; he’s correct there. But that last part simply and baldly pits all of research against NASA, and that is grossly unfair. Not only that, it’s dead wrong. For example, the NOAA — which does the type of research Etzioni is suggesting we do instead of space exploration — &lt;a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy09.htm"&gt;got about an 8% increase in its budget from 2008 to 2009&lt;/a&gt;; NASA got about 5%. DOE science got 15%. In &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; numbers, NASA’s budget is much larger than NOAA, but that’s not surprising since, in general, it’s harder and more expensive to get into space than it is to explore the oceans. But we do spend quite a bit on the exploration Etzioni is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Mr. Etzioni: we’re all in this together. You may note that in this essay I am not saying we should ditch one kind of science to support NASA, or vice-versa. I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; saying that to do this the right way, we need to support everyone. Scientific in-fighting, back biting, and narrow-minded territorial defensiveness will not help anyone, &lt;em&gt;and in fact hurts everyone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only possible, but I believe &lt;em&gt;mandated&lt;/em&gt;, that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us who love science and want to further the knowledge of humanity support each other’s endeavors. The public does in fact have a great interest in many fields of science, including space exploration, ocean exploration, biological exploration…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key word there is &lt;strong&gt;exploration&lt;/strong&gt;, and there’s enough Universe out there for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

As quoted by John McIntyre &lt;a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/mcintyre/blog/2009/03/so_our_headlines_stink.html"&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your headlines repeatedly use forms of the verb "to be".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, a headline on the homepage of the website right now reads, "Two men are slain in shooting at city carryout".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I'm sure your copy editors understand, this is a newspaper no-no because:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) It slows down the reader;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) It takes up precious headline space;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) It's just plain not classy; and most importantly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) It undermines the credibility of the reporter and, ultimately, the newspaper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your editors are having difficulty writing long-enough headlines, they find a solution that avoids the lazy decision of using a "to be" filler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's just so much here, not all of it touched on by McIntyre and the commenters on this posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last thing first: the charge of laziness. Commenters on usage quite commonly &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/attititudes-and-attributions/"&gt;attribute the motive&lt;/a&gt; of &amp;quot;laziness&amp;quot; to the user of any variant they believe to be incorrect/wrong. The idea is that the writer or speaker was too lazy to find out what the correct/right variant is — or if the writer or speaker believes that their variant is in fact correct/right, then they were too lazy to have learned otherwise (&amp;quot;they should have known better&amp;quot;). It&amp;#39;s not enough to say that the variant is incorrect/wrong, but the user of the variant must also be maligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then point 3, which baffled McIntyre and several commenters. I think I see what's going on here: the commenter believes that No &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; is actually one of a number of generalizations characterizing correct headline form, analogous to the generalizations characterizing (formal) standard (written) English — what many people think of as the &amp;quot;rules of grammar&amp;quot; for English. (Think of this as point 0: &amp;quot;this is a newspaper no-no&amp;quot;.) So using forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; in headlines would be analogous (for the complainant) to using flagrantly non-standard variants (like "double negatives", &lt;em&gt;ain't&lt;/em&gt;, 3sg &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt;, past-tense &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) in serious writing. That is, it's not "classy", in the same way that "I ain't done nothin' about it" isn't "classy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point 4 follows from this: if the paper uses non-standard variants, its reputation is tarnished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the objection is point 0, the claim that the characteristically "telegraphic" features of headlines are &lt;strong&gt;normative&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, effectively obligatory for good headlines. This is just nutty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telegraphic features of headlinese did, of course, evolve as a way of compressing information into small spaces: omitting (certain instances of) forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;, omitting (certain instances of) the articles &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, using simple present for perfect ("two men are slain" for "two men have been slain", when the former is virtually impossible in non-headline writing, or of course in speaking, to report a recent slaying), and so on. But they've never been obligatory; longer variants have always been possible, and can be found all over the place (I'll discuss some examples below). What headlinese offers is &lt;strong&gt;alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; — plus an indexing of the world of newspaper headlines, hot news, distanced reporting, and the like. More modest use of headlinese can convey a more conversational and engaged tone and the like. One of these is not better than the other; they&amp;#39;re simply different ways of talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to point 2: well, not taking up precious headline space is not the only virtue in the world. Clarity and comprehensibility are also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplifications of headlinese eliminate all sorts of clues to structure and meaning, forcing the reader to fall back on context, background knowledge, plausibility, and the like. All those "little words" are precious cues to meaning and intent. Excising them is not necessarily a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me back to point 1, the claim that the more explicit variants slow down readers &lt;strong&gt;simply because&lt;/strong&gt; they have more words. It's true that each word takes some time to process, but the time is tiny, and the processing burden is exquisitely sensitive to what sorts of words we're talking about. "Structure words", like forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;, articles, etc. facilitate processing by giving cues to structure and function. They can speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the complainant's deeper objection seems to be a version of Omit Needless Words, carried to an absurd conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; omit some word(s), you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, if the conventions of headlinese allow you to omit certain material, you must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would someone think this? I believe that there are three relevant background assumptions here, which I'm stating in very loose terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A) Semantic Equivalence: alternative formulations are in general equivalent in meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(B) One Right Way: alternative formulations are to be shunned; in any given context, only one of the alternatives should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(C) Brevity Rules: a shorter alternative is always to be preferred to a longer (because the longer alternatives are said to be fuzzy, imprecise, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted a number of times on the first two assumptions, not much on the third, though I must say it&amp;#39;s a very odd idea — forcing readers to do a ton of inferencing when they could be given at least some clues, even within the strictures of the headline world. No doubt (C) is a response to the practices of novice writers, who often ramble and embellish, but we&amp;#39;re not talking about novice writers here. This is about journalistic practice, and I can&amp;#39;t see why headline writers shouldn&amp;#39;t give readers as much help as they can, within the space limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A side point: reader Karen Ross posted on McIntyre's blog on 19 March to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was taught headlines should convey as much action as possible and using forms of "to be" make [sic] a headline more passive (and therefore less interesting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to which McIntyre replied that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two men slain in carryout" is every bit as much a passive construction as "Two men are slain in carryout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while noting that passive constructions are appropriate in various circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier note The Ridger (confronting the idea that "to be" = passive) replied to commenter M.C., saying that "it's nutty to assume using forms of "to be" is sloth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic for another day: the idea that frequent words — like forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;HAVE&lt;/small&gt;, the preposition &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; — should be avoided wherever possible. I suppose this is a muted version of &amp;quot;if they do it too much, they should be told not to do it at all&amp;quot;, which is &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003721.html"&gt;regrettable advice&lt;/a&gt; in general. Repeal Zipf's Law!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a few headlines from the 21 March 2009 issue of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (the first section of the National Edition). Page 1 has six articles that in principle could have omitted, though not with equal felicity (I'll cite the heads as single lines, without reproducing the line divisions in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Delayed Bank Rescue Will Set Up &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; Public-Private Partnership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar Is Back on Food Labels, This Time as &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; Selling Point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An&lt;/strong&gt; Old and Faraway Dispute Goes Home with &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; Cleaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Nod Before Iran's Election&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; Game At 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus a copula in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Back on Food Labels … [above]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the conjunction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Old &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; Faraway Dispute … [above]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there's an &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in a progressive construction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adventure Travelers, Your Tour Bus &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Now Boarding for Basra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty more article and &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; examples (5 article examples just on p. A2), but now I'll restrict myself to forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;. A sampling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's Video Message to Iran &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning of Diplomatic Push (A2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team U.S.A. &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Unlikely Undedog (A3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upset &lt;strong&gt;Was&lt;/strong&gt; Just the Beginning (A3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama's Positive Message to Iran &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; an Opening Bid in a Diplomatic Drive (A4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada: Antiwar Briton &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Barred (A5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico Ex-Governor &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; Aquitted Of Graft (A9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo's A.I.G. Moment &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; His Political Moment (A11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspected Riverdale Archer &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; New Neighbor with an Old Story (A13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Boundaries &lt;strong&gt;Are&lt;/strong&gt; Melting, a Place to Celebrate Differences (A14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not all of these would be equally felicitous with the form of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; excised, though most would get by.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we've got ordinary copulas (with NP complements, but elsewhere with AdjPs and PPs), &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; in passives, and &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; in progressives, in considerable profusion. I don't think this deviates a lot from journalistic practice these days, though I don't doubt that the frequencies have shifted over the years and vary from publication to publication, and from section to section within a publication. But the idea that all these examples would be better with the forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; excised is just ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog may recall that I am a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/11/the_stemwedel_index_of_luddite.php"&gt;tremendous Luddite&lt;/a&gt;.  Obviously, this should not be taken to mean I am against all technological advances across the board (as here I am, typing on a computer, preparing a post that will be published using blogging software on the internet).  Rather, I am suspicious of technological advances that seem to arise without much thought about how they influence the experience of the humans interacting with them, and of "improvements" that would require me to sink a bunch of time into learning new commands or operating instructions while producing at best a marginal improvement over the outcome I get from the technology I already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is to say, my own inclination is to view technologies not as ends in themselves but as tools which, depending on how they are deployed, can enhance our lives or can make them harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddites"&gt;original Luddites&lt;/a&gt; were part of a workers' movement in England in the early 19th century.  The technologies these Luddites were against included the mechanical knitting machines and looms that shifted textile production from the hands of skilled knitters and weavers to a relatively unskilled labor force tending to the machines.  In the current economic climate, it's not too hard to see what the Luddites were worried about: even if the Industrial Revolution technologies didn't result in an overall decrease in jobs (since you'd need workers to tend the machines), there would be no reason to assume that the owners of textile factories would be interested in retraining the skilled knitters and weavers already in existence to be the machine-tenders.  And net stability (even increase) in the number of jobs can be cold comfort when your job goes away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/a_tremendous_luddite_celebrate.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/a_tremendous_luddite_celebrate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/tK9yP9OrxRM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237916151885"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-24.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1959e5db266be04a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linkfest"/><title type="html">links for 2009-03-24</title><published>2009-03-24T13:05:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T13:05:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/N9jmbLh8z-g/links_for_2009-03-24.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-24.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

He has been working in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering"&gt;software engineering&lt;/a&gt; field since 1994. Isaac is an Adobe Community Expert for &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/"&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/a&gt; and is also the visionary behind &lt;a href="http://www.autlabs.com/"&gt;Autelligent Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Tell us about Autelligent Laboratories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac: AutLabs will create challenging and rewarding technical jobs for software engineers on the autistic spectrum. By creating a positive work environment in which autistic people can excel, we plan to provide excellent value to our clients, showcase the many talents of our employees and hope to achieve significant strides toward resolving other autism community issues such as communication challenges and social anxiety.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: Tell me about the conception of AutLabs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac: Fundamentally, my first goal is to make the world a better place to live in. On a personal level, I feel that Autlabs is the best way for me to make use of my talents in a way that fills a need that's currently under-served. There are a handful of companies that have started to seek out autistic workers although the ones I've seen are either on another continent or are within an established company. Autelligent will be the first company I'm aware of designed from the ground up to nurture the talents of autistic workers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: How can the Autistic community become involved in this project?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac: We encourage anyone interested in helping us to visit our website and to make contact with us. Spreading the word about our organization, via blogs and favorite forums, is also appreciated. We have particular interest in hearing from potential investors, as well as sales and marketing professionals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: What type of skills should potential employees possess and will AutLabs be able to provide on-the-job training?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac: Skills can be taught and yes we'll be learning them on the job. What employees need to have when they come to work with us is an interest in computers and software, as well as a strong desire to learn and excel. Software is among a handful of careers in which continual learning is absolutely essential, and I hope that we will continue to learn valuable communication and life skills as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elesia: What are the advantages of basing AutLabs out of Dallas, Texas?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac: There's a good technology base here in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area with the telecom corridor in the north Dallas area. It's also a bustling metropolis in general and that's good news for any software company. It means we can find clients next door although I'm sure we'll have clients across the country and around the world as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac has created a Wiki page in addition to the Autelligent Laboratories website. Click &lt;a href="http://autlabs.wikispaces.com/Business+Plan"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to visit the Wiki page and learn more about AutLabs' mission, philosophy, and business model.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Elesia Ashkenazy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237913758687"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_bus_drivers_name_is_mom">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffb4b28e0239b524</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">When the Bus Driver's Name is Mom</title><published>2009-03-24T15:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T15:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_bus_drivers_name_is_mom" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://lehmanbussales.com/inventory/upload/car_14.jpg" height="140" alt="School bus image from Lehman Bus Sales http://lehmanbussales.com/" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="210"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/whos_driving_the_school_bus"&gt;Who's driving the school bus&lt;/a&gt; has been a question often on my mind since Jim and I put Charlie on a little yellow school bus six and a half years ago. It felt like a leap of faith to consign then 4 1/2 year old Charlie to the care of Mr. Richard, on a bus that already contained some ten other children on the spectrum (and, improbably, no bus matron). Charlie was in an in-district autism program in the public schools then and his ride was not too long. But in the winter and spring of 1995-1996, he attended a private school and had a 45 minute "commute" each way: Not the longest, but a ride on which things could potentially go awry and sometimes did (the aide spoke no English and all of us had doubts at how much "training" she and the driver, who were both very good-hearted, had with kids with disabilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I didn't feel too surprised to read about a New Jersey mother, Alison Torres, who drives her three sons, all of whom are on the autism spectrum, to school and is paid $75/day by the Winslow Township School District for doing so. The $75 is for car and gas expenses, and for "additional car insurance injury liability coverage to $1 million." Reports yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20090323/NEWS01/903230325"&gt;Courier-Post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslow Schools Superintendent H. Major Poteat said it's a win-win situation for the school district. State officials agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was the most economic decision. If I had to hire another bus, and aide, it would cost me over $21,000. If I had gotten a taxicab, the driver needs a certain certification to do it. That would cost over $15,000," Poteat said. "When you talk about cost-efficient, this was the most cost-efficient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement is a rare parent-driving contract, one of 152 statewide this year, according to state Department of Education records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the tri-county area, nine similar contracts have been approved for the current school year as of Oct. 15, 2008, with West Deptford holding one-third of them worth more than $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in Hainesport is for $3,459. And the district's superintendent, Mark Silverstein, said it is worth every penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torres notes that she'd rather her children take the bus; since her children don't attend the school nearest her house, a ride on a school bus route would mean that they'd be late 10 to 15 minutes every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an intriguing situation, with a public school district paying a parent to provide transportation that's mandated as part of Torres' sons' right to a "free and appropriate public education." I'm not sure if this economic solution is truly appropriate: One thing to get driven to school in your parent's car, another thing to ride a bus with a driver and other kids, and without a parent. What lessons aren't Torres' children learning by not riding a school district-provided bus?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237913409978"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1284">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/154b7bf847b28c21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Health Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense</title><published>2009-03-24T15:18:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T15:18:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dcscience.net/?p=1284" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The Health Professions Council (HPC) is yet another regulatory quango.

&lt;p&gt;Just stop there and savor it. The man who wants to dictate what all of the children in one of the largest educational systems in the country should learn about science believes his pathetic and patently false superstition supersedes the evidence and the informed evaluation of virtually all the scientists in the world. There is no other way to put it than to point out that McLeroy is a blithering idiot who willingly puts his incompetence on display. His job is not at risk, and he's even advancing his freakish agenda with some success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a marvel, isn't it? A fellow just wants to laugh and shoo him back to his church and his dental practice, but instead, he's been given all this power over the education of American children, and it's hard to laugh, because it is so damned terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! The unbelievable insanity is not yet complete! The &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB123777413372910705-lMyQjAxMDI5MzI3MzcyNzM0Wj.html"&gt;Texas school board is debating and will vote on a revised curriculum this week&lt;/a&gt;, a curriculum in which the uninformed, uneducated doubts of this arrogantly ignorant man will be enshrined in the lesson plans of every child in Texas. And the board is about evenly split!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a deeper problem here than the simple superficial fact that we've got influential people trying to push nonsense into science classrooms. It's that somehow, we have a system that &lt;i&gt;gives&lt;/i&gt; flaming incompetents this kind of power — that we willingly hand over important decisions about the education of our children to people who aren&amp;#39;t qualified, who have no understanding of science, and who want prioritize a page and a half of vague, poetic metaphor from a ragged old hodge-podge of a book of mythology over the concrete, well-tested, and well-documented body of modern scientific information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's ludicrous and painful to watch. &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/commons/readerblogs/evosphere.html?plckController=Blog&amp;amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;amp;plckPostId=Blog%3af12fd84e-253f-46cf-9408-ee579f9a3a0bPost%3a064ef55c-80b1-44b4-ae22-cec837a93d8f"&gt;Steve Schafersman will be live-blogging the proceedings&lt;/a&gt;. I think we're obligated to follow along, in order to suffer for our national shortcomings. Think of it as penance, and as an object lesson. We need to correct the structural problems in the governance of our educational systems, no matter which way the decision goes. If you are in Texas, and you care about good science, then you should plan on &lt;a href="http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer?pagename=SBOE_Testimony_FAQ_Page"&gt;showing up and testifying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even that is sad and pitiful. We rely now on getting enough presentable people to show up and speak forcefully in order to persuade a state board of education to support science?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/how_did_we_get_to_this_point.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UDo_kyOBEtE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237912938132"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/03/with-all-due-respect/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6916c36f1e2313b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skeptics"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">With all due respect…</title><published>2009-03-24T16:33:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T16:33:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/03/with-all-due-respect/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a great comedy piece a few years back (whose origin escapes us) that gave examples of how the English would use their language when speaking to a non-native speaker to imply the precise opposite of what was actually being understood. This allowed the English to feel superior without actually damaging international relations. One example was the phrase "with all due respect" which is generally understood to imply that the speaker has a great deal of respect for their counterpart, while the speaker is actually implying that they have no respect in the slightest for their interlocutor. The respect due being precisely zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought occurred to us when a few of us opened our email this week to see a draft ad being sent around by the Cato Institute (i.e. Pat Michaels) looking for signatories prior to being published in "major US newspapers" sometime soon:   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/docs/cato_ad.pdf"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/cato_ad.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of amusing details here. While we are curious about the credentials of "Dr. N. Here",  we certainly understand why they are looking for a little more variety on the list. More surprising (and somewhat ironically) the mailing list for signature requests includes a number of scientists who don't agree with these sentiments at all. It's as if Michaels and Cato actually believe that these various lists of "dissenting" scientists are accurate reflections of support for their agenda. They appear to be have been conned by their own disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exercise for our readers, perhaps people would like to speculate on who is going to end up on the published list? (If indeed it gets published). Ginger Spice would be likely on past form, but they might improve the screening this time around…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most amusing are the footnotes that they use to bolster their case. There are four: the brand new &lt;a href="http://www.uwm.edu/~kswanson/publications/2008GL037022_all.pdf"&gt;Swanson and Tsonis&lt;/a&gt; (GRL, 2009), Brohan et al (JGR, 2006) (which is there to provide a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/"&gt;HadCRU temperature data&lt;/a&gt;),  Pielke et al (BAMS, 2005),  and the oft-derided &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117857349/abstract"&gt;Douglass et al&lt;/a&gt; (IJoC, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these papers, not one has the evidence to support the statements attributed to them in the main text. To wit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now.&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the first part of the statement is exactly what you expect with a modest long-term trend in the presence of internal variability and is not controversial in the least. The "global warming stopped" meme is particularly lame since it relies on both a feigned ignorance of the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/01/uncertainty-noise-and-the-art-of-model-data-comparison/"&gt;statistics of short periods&lt;/a&gt; and being careful about which data set you use. It also requires cherry-picking the start year, had the period been "exactly a decade" or 12 years then all the trends are positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the recent Swanson and Tsonis paper is simply opportunism. Those authors specifically state that their results are not in any way contradictory with the idea of a long term global warming trend. Instead they are attempting to characterise the internal variability that everyone knows exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This references a short comment in BAMS that didn't present any original research. The latest figures show that weather-related damages have increased markedly, though whether there is a climate change component is &lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/gore-pulls-slide-of-disaster-trends/"&gt;hard to tease out&lt;/a&gt; given the large increases in vulnerable infrastructure and relatively poor data. The actual statement that a clear global warming-related trend in damages hasn't been clearly demonstrated doesn't imply that you can state definitively that there is no effect. There might be one (or not), but formal attribution is hard. However, whatever the attribution ends up being, pointing out that there are other problems in the world &lt;a href="http://thingsbreak.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/lomborg-long-game/"&gt;doesn't imply&lt;/a&gt; that anthropogenic climate change is not worth worrying about. One might as well state that since knee injuries on ski-slopes have increased over time one shouldn't support flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Abjectly&amp;#39;? Very strange choice of word…. and an even stranger choice of reference. This is of course the same Douglass et al paper that used &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/tropical-troposphere-trends/"&gt;completely incoherent statistics&lt;/a&gt; and deliberately failed to note the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/tropical-tropopshere-ii/"&gt;structural uncertainty in the observations&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, Michaels does not reference the rather comprehensive demolition of the Douglass methodology published by &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/tropical-tropopshere-iii/"&gt;Santer et al (2008)&lt;/a&gt; (and on which one of us was a co-author). More fundamentally however, the current temperatures are still within the spread of the models even if you cherry pick your start date. No-one expects the real world (a single realization) to follow the mean forced trend at all times. How is that a failure, abject or otherwise? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly is what is not cited. President Obama's &lt;a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president_elect_obama_promises_new_chapter_on_climate_change/"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;"The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear", can't possibly refer to every issue in science or every potential fact. Instead he is likely referring to the basic and pretty much uncontested facts that i) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases have increased due to human activity. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in particular continue to increase at a rapid rate; ii) the effect of these gases is to warm the climate and it is very likely that most of the warming over the last 50 years was in fact driven by these increases; and iii) the sensitivity of the climate is very likely large enough that serious consequences can be expected if carbon emissions continue on this path. We would be astonished if Michaels disputed this since he is on record as agreeing that the IPCC climate sensitivity range is likely to be correct and has never questioned the human contribution to CO2 and other GHG increases. He and his colleagues have even done analyses that show that after correcting for ENSO effects, there is no sign of a slowdown in global warming at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead this is a classic red-herring: Ignore the facts you don't dispute, pick some others that are ambiguous and imply that, because they are subject to some debate, we therefore know nothing. Michaels (and Cato) presumably thinks this kind of nonsense is politically useful and he may be correct. But should he claim it is scientifically defensible, we would have to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With all due respect, Dr. Michaels, that is not true."&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who isn’t already following their excellent work is encouraged to go have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great timing, as Sheril and Chris are experts in the intersection of science and journalism (among other intersections), and that’s going to be a hot topic in the days to come.  There was something of a dustup a few months ago, set off by dueling Bloggingheads dialogues, first from science bloggers &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/16352"&gt;Abbie Smith and Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, then by journalists &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/16633?in=00:46:39&amp;amp;out=00:51:05"&gt;George Johnson and John Horgan&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently Abbie was questioning the role of journalists in an era where scientists can reach out themselves through blogs, and George responded in a somewhat intemperate fashion.  (He later apologized for the tone, although not really the sentiment.)  Much back-and-forth ensued — see responses by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2008/12/science_bloggers_vs_journalist.php"&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/12/bloggers_vs_journalists_alephn.php"&gt;Chad Orzel&lt;/a&gt;.  And just last week, Geoff Brumfiel at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; wrote a feature exploring the relationship &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html"&gt;between science journalism and science blogs&lt;/a&gt;, with the tagline:  “But can the one replace the other?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no.  Science blogging will never replace science journalism, any more than other kinds of blogging will replace other kinds of journalism.  (Of course blogging can include just about any kind of writing, including what we usually call “journalism”; I’m thinking here of the specific case of people whose day job is doing science, and who blog in their spare time.)  They have very different roles.  Journalists are paid to cover stories of wide interest, to get multiple perspectives on new results, and to be as objective as possible in separating the wheat from the chaff.  Science bloggers are sometimes going to blog about something newsworthy, but most can’t be bothered trying to cover every interesting story, and years will pass before a typical blogger picks up a phone to interview a source before posting.  Instead, they bring a special expertise and inside knowledge to a field that no general-purpose journalist can hope to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what the source of controversy really is.  It seems perfectly obvious that science blogging should enrich and extend conventional science journalism, not aspire to replace it.  (See also sensible takes from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/03/is_the_internet_to_blame_for_t.php"&gt;Jessica Palmer at bioephemera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/natures_artificial_divide.php?page=al"&gt;Curtis Brainard at the &lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  [Hey!  A blogger and a journalist!])  Movies didn’t replace live theater, airplanes didn’t replace cars, mammals didn’t replace birds.  These are things that serve different functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation we should be having is how the two forms can work together.  How great would it be, for example, if major newspapers regularly linked to relevant blog entries by real experts when a big science story broke?  It might actually require some effort to make something like that happen, just because of the way journalism these days works, including the tradition of embargoed results.  When the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/08/21/dark-matter-exists/"&gt;Bullet Cluster results indicating the existence of dark matter&lt;/a&gt; were first released, I was lucky enough to be a participant in the original press conference, so I had access to the papers before most people did.  Consequently, I was able to write an informed post that could be pointed to by people looking for an expert-level discussion.  But ordinarily, such pre-embargo access is only given to professional journalists.  If the communities worked a bit more closely together, we might be able to more regularly combine the reportage and explanatory skills of professional journalists with the in-depth perspective of professional scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1883785,00.html"&gt;newspapers are dying&lt;/a&gt;.  CNN &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/03/cnn-catches-the-stupid/"&gt;shut down its science division&lt;/a&gt;.  The amount of real science journalism is shrinking dramatically, and any scientist who thinks that’s a good thing for the field as a whole is living in crazy land.  The old ways of doing business are crumbling, and we have to find new ways to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

Simon is a pro at delivering an absorbing history filled with colorful characters, and in this book one that stood out was Sophie Germain, a French mathematician. In honor of &lt;a href="http://www.deliberatepixel.com/2009/01/08/ada-lovelace-day"&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/a&gt; (already?? It seems to come earlier each year) I figured I’d tell you a little about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie was born in Paris on April 1, 1776, a time when women weren’t seen as the mathematical sort. You and I were also born during a time like that, but at least we’d have had a slightly easier time getting into college to study it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the French Revolution started heating up, Sophie’s family locked her up in their house to keep her safe, at which point the 13-year old girl took an interest in mathematics. Supposedly, she was inspired by the story of Archimedes, who was so engrossed in a geometry problem he failed to notice that he was about to be murdered by a Roman soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_germain"&gt;&lt;img title="Sophie Germain (via Wikipedia)" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Germain.jpeg/225px-Germain.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Taking advantage of her father’s extensive library, she taught herself math as well as Greek and Latin so she could study classical scholars. Her parents didn’t like all that book learnin’ (who would marry a girl like that?), so she studied at night until they took away her candles to keep her from reading after dark. She was so committed that eventually her parents gave in, and she became one of the most talented mathematicians in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man named Monsieur Le Blanc was studying math at the world-famous École Polytechnique, but he ultimately proved to be an uninspired and untalented mathematician. When he left the school for new adventures, Sophie took on his role at the school, using him as a pseudonym to get lecture notes and engage in correspondence with other scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s greatest mathematicians were impressed with M. Le Blanc’s work, and a few of them ended up discovering that Sophie was the real genius behind the name. The most interesting story is Sophie’s relationship with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss&lt;/a&gt; (whose work helped astronomers study Ceres). Gauss and “Le Blanc” had a long and fruitful correspondence, until word reached Sophie that Napoleon was preparing to invade Gauss’ Prussian hometown. Sophie was worried that Gauss would be killed, and so asked a general (who happened to be a family friend) to protect him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauss was spared, and when the general informed him that he owed his life to one Sophie Germain, Abbot-and-Costello-like antics ensued. Eventually, it came out that Sophie was Le Blanc, and Gauss was blown away. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how to describe to you my admiration and astonishment at seeing my esteemed correspondent Monsieur Le Blanc metamorphose himself into this illustrious personage who gives such a brilliant example of what I would find it difficult to believe. A taste for the abstract sciences in general and above all the mysteries of numbers is excessively rare: one is not astonished at it: the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a person of the sex which, according to our customs and prejudices, must encounter infinitely more difficulties than men to familiarize herself with these thorny researches, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, then without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius. Indeed nothing could prove to me in so flattering and less equivocal manner that the attractions of this science, which has enriched my life with so many joys, are not chimerical, [than] the predilection with which you have honored it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aww. Both mathematicians went on to do more great work. Sophie contributed to the effort to develop a proof for Fermat’s Last Theorem by using prime numbers, discovering (among other things) the importance of prime numbers that fit the equation: if p is a prime number, then 2p+1 is also prime (thanks to Blake for pointing out that I screwed up my math facts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Gauss fell out of touch with Sophie when he saw something shiny in another field of mathematics. Possibly hoping to make up for his poor correspondence later, he petitioned the University of Göttingen to grant her an honorary degree. Unfortunately, by the time they agreed to give it to her in 1831, Sophie lost a battle with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it – an awesome lady who fought hard to make great contributions to the world of mathematics. Happy Ada Lovelace Day!&lt;/p&gt;

That is the new name for what is known in popular culture as cold fusion - the production of energy from nuclear fusion as room temperature or other low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold fusion made its first big splash 20 years ago this week when Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons held a press conference in which they claimed that they had created energy from cold fusion in their lab. Their announcement was met with both excitement and skepticism. The skepticism, it turns out, was justified as in the years following no one has been able to replicate the alleged cold fusion of Pons and Fleischmann, including them. They spent years in a French lab trying to replication their effects and failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement is easy to understand, as is a resurgence of interest. Energy is the primary limiting factor of civilization and quality of life - energy use tracks very closely with material quality of life. The expense of energy is part of the expense of almost all goods and services. And right now we are facing concerns over the environmental impact of our energy infrastructure. A source of abundant, cheap, clean, renewable energy would solve a great many problems and be a boon to human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusion occurs when like-charged atomic particles - like protons, or atoms of protons and neutrons, are forced together under great temperature and pressure so that they fuse together to make a larger atom. The electromagnetic repulsion of the like charges has to be overcome and the particles brought close enough together so that the nuclear forces will take over and fuse them together. For elements lighter than iron fusion results in an excess of energy, and for elements heavier than iron energy has to be put into the system for fusion to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear fusion is what powers the sun - right now mostly hydrogen being fused into helium. Fusion bombs work by using a fission bomb to force a pellet of nuclear material together with sufficient force to cause fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is that some form of confinement is needed to force the protons together. Stars use gravitational confinement - their immense gravity pushes the hydrogen together until it fuses, and hold it together despite the outward explose force of the energy created by fusion. Fusion bombs use inertial confinement created by the fission explosion. But there can also be magnetic confinement where strong magnetic fields force the charged particles together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limiting factor in all of these scenarios is that extreme force must be used to force fusion to happen. This is great for creating a bomb, but nof for a sustained controllable reaction where the energy can be harnessed. Engineers are working on creating hot-fusion for energy, but the engineering challenges are extreme and we cannot even predict at this point when such technology will be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Fusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the allure of cold fusion. If we could somehow cajole hydrogen atoms, or some other light element, to fuse together without the extreme activation energy needed for known methods of confinement, we could theoretically have a low energy nuclear reaction - LENR or cold fusion. This would be easier to control and harness. Nuclear reactions results in vast amounts of relesed energy, so such a source could be abundant. The process would not generate any greenhouse gases or radioactive waste. Hydrogen as a fuel source could be harvested from water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that so far there is no evidence that anyone has been able to do it. There have been many claims, even beyond Pons and Fleischmann, but they all suffer from the same problem - lack of reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold fusion claims tend to take the form of Pons and Fleischmann’s claim - a laboratory setup that seems to produce a bit of excess energy, often in the form of heat. The claim for nuclear fusion is mainly based upon an argument from ignorance - there is a bit of unexplained energy in the experiment, therefore that energy is coming from nuclear fusion. This is the same logic used to argue that an unidentified light in the sky is a flying saucer, or an unexplained blob of light on a photo is a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with this line of evidence. The first is that it is easy to miss a subtle source of energy. Basing a claim on the inability to explain a tiny bit of energy is inherently weak - evern the tiniest error or oversight could explain the results, and tiny errors and oversights are common. Only through rigorous replication designed to eliminate as much as possible any such errors or oversights would a cold fusion claim be compelling, and so far no such claims have survived attempts at replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is the absence of positive evidence for fusion specifically as the source of the unexplained energy. If hydrogen is being fused into helium, then helium should be detected. This process also produces neutrons, tritium, and gamma rays. So far no experiment claiming excess heat from cold fusion has been able to document the simultaneous presence of helium, neutrons, tritium and gamma rays in sufficient quantities to what is predicted should occur if fusion is the cause of the excess heat. Some researchers have claimed finding these things in excess of background levels, but just barely, and still orders of magnitude less than predicted. So again, slight experimental error is a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspiracy Theories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course any controversy such as this, especially with high stakes and government involvement, will attract the conspiracy theorists like a tub of rocky road at fat camp. “Big Oil” needs to protect their profits from the prospect of cheap abundant energy, therefore they and their government stooges are suppressing real evidence for cold fusion. This is the typical argument from final consequences logical fallacy of many conspiracy theorists - someone has a motivation to commit such a conspiracy, therefore they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who disagrees with the claims of cold fusion, regardless of the logical and scientific nature of their objections, is part of the conspiracy or a hopeless dupe. Only the “army of light” can see the conspiracy for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, we are no where near achieving cold fusion, which may not even be possible. Justifications for cold fusion at present are purely speculative. I have no problem with companies or individuals dedicating their time and resources to researching cold fusion. I think it is prudent to invest a small amount in research into unlikely claims that are at least possible and would have a huge payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, large scale government investment does not seem warranted by current evidence and theory. This also brings up the relationship between basic scientific research and translational research. The purpose of the latter is to take basic research and find specific applications in the real world. I am all for fairly open-ended basic research. Let scientists pursue the questions that interest them. That is likely to produce the most bang for our research buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem arises, however, if translational research is embarked upon prematurely - translational research that is not justified by the basic science.  Translational research usually is framed as addressing a specific problem - curing a disease, or finding an alternate energy source. Justification for such research is often made according to need - this is a bad disease, or we really need clean energy. This is legitimate, but insufficient. Such research needs to also be based upon solid basic science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the basic science does not point the way to a plausible solution, then diverting funds from basic science to translational problem-solving research is likely to be counterproductive. It will not solve the problem and will slow the basic research that might eventually illuminate a possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to cold fusion, it seems to me (as an outside lurker and not a nuclear physicist) that the basic science is not here, and no one knows if it ever will be. We are better off continuing basic science research to uncover and explore possible new physical processes that might be exploited in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, hedging our bets with a small amount of cold fusion research is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also true that sometime application research comes before basic science research - in that someone discovers an effect which cannot be explained, and this spawns basic science research to explain it. Therefore, if someone could demonstrate cold fusion then basic science researchers would have a new avenue of research to explore. However, in such cases it is necessary to document to a very high degree of scientific confidence that the new and unexplained phenomenon actually exists. So far this has not been done for cold fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor has it been done for anomalous cognition or ESP, ghosts, alien spacecraft, spontaneous human combustion, or the typical long list of dubious claims skeptics often confront. This puts cold fusion squarely in the “alternative science” camp. Serious researchers claim that Pons and Fleischmann have “ghettoized” their field of research with their premature claims. This may be true - but the lack of replicable evidence has kept it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple - show us the cold fusion.&lt;/p&gt;

What impressed the atheist community, too, was that this was not a case where the crew credited some fickle deity for keeping them alive — it was good old skill, training, and keeping a cool head in times of danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, instead, the pilot had trusted in a god? &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0324/breaking25.htm"&gt;We've got an example of that&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plane made a similar emergency water landing off the coast of Sicily in 2005. In this case, the Tunisian pilot panicked, and instead of taking emergency measures or even trying to reach a nearby airport, he instead chose to &lt;i&gt;pray&lt;/i&gt; loudly. I'm sure that was reassuring to the passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen people died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason gets some revenge, though. The pilot has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for his neglect of his responsibilities. I like that; resorting to prayer represents an abdication of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/what_not_to_do_in_an_emergency.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/u9uWvxjtytI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237909909925"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/in_which_i_am_woefully_accurat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53328bb2d2fa6353</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">In which I am woefully accurate</title><published>2009-03-24T15:15:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T15:15:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ecWODr5jVdg/in_which_i_am_woefully_accurat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/in_which_i_am_woefully_accurat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/octopods_from_the_cretaceous.php"&gt;spectacular Cretaceous octopus fossils&lt;/a&gt;, and I made a blatant prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accustomed as I am to the workings of the minds of creationists, though, I'm sad to say that I also immediately saw how this find will be abused. I guarantee you that Harun Yahya is grabbing these images and planning to stuff them into his next bloated and repetitive tome, with a caption that announces that there has been no change in octopuses over 95 million years, therefore evolution is false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After explaining the differences between these fossils and modern forms, and showing a chart that illustrated the transitional nature of their morphology, I further stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the superficial resemblance — there are more subtleties to being an octopus than simply having eight arms. What these fossils reveal is more detail about the evolution of the octopods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my only error was on pinning this kind of stupidity explicitly on Harun Yahya. I should have known there were plenty of local idiots who would, in their sublime ignorance about cephalopods, leap to the &lt;a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/literature/2009/03/20/cretaceous_fossil_assigned_to_the_recent"&gt;false conclusion that this is an example of stasis&lt;/a&gt; (it isn't: these are &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; than modern forms), and claim that the octopus &lt;a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2009/03/evolution-in-95-million-years-couldnt.html"&gt;"did not evolve at all"&lt;/a&gt;. Please note: having eight arms is a very general property of the octopods. You can't just throw away all the evolutionary change that is described because you are so unaware that you see everything with eight arms as being the same creature. There are over 200 species named in the family Octopodidae, with over 100 waiting further description and classification, and no doubt many more awaiting discovery. They are incredibly diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these blind kooks are doing is the equivalent of pointing out that paleontologists have discovered 365 million year old tetrapods, that all mammals today still have four limbs, and claiming, therefore, that evolution did not occur.&lt;/p&gt;

Simon is a pro at delivering an absorbing history filled with colorful characters, and in this book one that stood out was Sophie Germain, a French mathematician. In honor of &lt;a href="http://www.deliberatepixel.com/2009/01/08/ada-lovelace-day"&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/a&gt; (already?? It seems to come earlier each year) I figured I’d tell you a little about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie was born in Paris on April 1, 1776, a time when women weren’t seen as the mathematical sort. You and I were also born during a time like that, but at least we’d have had a slightly easier time getting into college to study it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the French Revolution started heating up, Sophie’s family locked her up in their house to keep her safe, at which point the 13-year old girl took an interest in mathematics. Supposedly, she was inspired by the story of Archimedes, who was so engrossed in a geometry problem he failed to notice that he was about to be murdered by a Roman soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_germain"&gt;&lt;img title="Sophie Germain (via Wikipedia)" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Germain.jpeg/225px-Germain.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Taking advantage of her father’s extensive library, she taught herself math as well as Greek and Latin so she could study classical scholars. Her parents didn’t like all that book learnin’ (who would marry a girl like that?), so she studied at night until they took away her candles to keep her from reading after dark. She was so committed that eventually her parents gave in, and she became one of the most talented mathematicians in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man named Monsieur Le Blanc was studying math at the world-famous École Polytechnique, but he ultimately proved to be an uninspired and untalented mathematician. When he left the school for new adventures, Sophie took on his role at the school, using him as a pseudonym to get lecture notes and engage in correspondence with other scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s greatest mathematicians were impressed with M. Le Blanc’s work, and a few of them ended up discovering that Sophie was the real genius behind the name. The most interesting story is Sophie’s relationship with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss&lt;/a&gt; (whose work helped astronomers study Ceres). Gauss and “Le Blanc” had a long and fruitful correspondence, until word reached Sophie that Napoleon was preparing to invade Gauss’ Prussian hometown. Sophie was worried that Gauss would be killed, and so asked a general (who happened to be a family friend) to protect him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauss was spared, and when the general informed him that he owed his life to one Sophie Germain, Abbot-and-Costello-like antics ensued. Eventually, it came out that Sophie was Le Blanc, and Gauss was blown away. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how to describe to you my admiration and astonishment at seeing my esteemed correspondent Monsieur Le Blanc metamorphose himself into this illustrious personage who gives such a brilliant example of what I would find it difficult to believe. A taste for the abstract sciences in general and above all the mysteries of numbers is excessively rare: one is not astonished at it: the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a person of the sex which, according to our customs and prejudices, must encounter infinitely more difficulties than men to familiarize herself with these thorny researches, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, then without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius. Indeed nothing could prove to me in so flattering and less equivocal manner that the attractions of this science, which has enriched my life with so many joys, are not chimerical, [than] the predilection with which you have honored it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aww. Both mathematicians went on to do more great work. Sophie contributed to the effort to develop a proof for Fermat’s Last Theorem by using prime numbers, discovering (among other things) &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is a prime number, then 2&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;+1 is also prime.&lt;/span&gt; the importance of prime numbers that fit the equation: if p is a prime number, then 2p+1 is also prime (thanks to Blake for pointing out that I screwed up my math facts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Gauss fell out of touch with Sophie when he saw something shiny in another field of mathematics. Possibly hoping to make up for his poor correspondence later, he petitioned the University of Göttingen to grant her an honorary degree. Unfortunately, by the time they agreed to give it to her in 1831, Sophie lost a battle with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it – an awesome lady who fought hard to make great contributions to the world of mathematics. Happy Ada Lovelace Day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The HPC’s strapline is
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with health professionals to protect the public”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/hpc-logo.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present &lt;a href="http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/"&gt;the  HPC regulates&lt;/a&gt;; Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists,  clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department  practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists,  radiographers and speech &amp;amp; language therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are thirteen very respectable jobs.  With the possible exception of art therapists, nobody would doubt for a moment that they are scientific jobs, based on evidence. Dietitians, for example, are the real experts on nutrition (in contrast to “nutritional therapists” and the like, who are part of the alternative industry).  That is just as well because the ten criteria for registration with the HPC say that aspirant groups must have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Practise based on evidence of efficacy”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then came the Pittilo report, about which I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece"&gt;commentary in the Times&lt;/a&gt;, and here, &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=251"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both the Pittilo report, the HPC, and indeed the Department of Health itself (watch this space), seem quite unable to grasp the obvious fact that   you cannot come up with any sensible form of regulation until after you have decided whether the ‘therapy’ works or whether it is so much nonsense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  no sense can “the public be protected” by setting educational standards  for nonsense.  But this obvioua fact seems to be beyond the intellectual grasp of the quangoid box-ticking mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That report recommended that the HPC should regulate also Medical Herbalists,  Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners. Even more absurdly, it recommended degrees in these subjects, just at the moment that those universities who run them are beginning to realise that they are anti-scientific subjects and closing down degrees in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could these three branches of the alternative medicine industry possibly be eligible to register with the  HPC when one of the criteria for registration is that there must be “practise  based on evidence of efficacy”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impossible, I hear you say.  But if you said that, I fear you may have underestimated the capacity of the official mind for pure double-speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HPC  published a report on 11 September 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf"&gt;Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the last conclusion contradicts directly the requirement for “practise based on evidence of efficacy”.  I was curious about how this contradiction&lt;br&gt;
could be resolved so I sent a list of questions.  The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/dc-to-hpc%205%20Dec%202008.pdf"&gt;full  letter is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was addressed to the president of the  HPC, Anna van der Gaag, but with the customary discourtesy of such organisations, it was not  answered by her but by Michael Guthrie, Head of Policy and Standards   He said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our Council considered the report at its meeting in July 2008 and decided that the regulation of these groups was necessary on the grounds of public protection. The Council decided to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Health that these groups be regulated. &lt;a href="http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf&lt;/a&gt; “.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, doesn’t answer any of my questions.  It does not explain how the public is protected by insisting on formal qualifications, if the qualifications&lt;br&gt;
happen to teach mythical nonsense. Later the reply got into deeper water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would additionally add that the new professions criteria are more focused on the process and structures of regulation, rather than the underlying rationale for regulation - the protection of members of the public. The Council considered the group’s report in light of a scoring against the criteria. The criteria on efficacy was one that was scored part met. As you have outlined in your email (and as discussed in the report itself) the evidence of efficacy (at least to western standards) is limited overall, particularly in the areas of herbal medicines and traditional Chinese medicine. However, the evidence base is growing and there was a recognition in the report that the individualised approach to practice in these areas did not lend themselves to traditional RCT research designs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, based on process and structures (without engaging the brain it seems).   Rather reminiscent of the great scandal in UK Social Services. It is right  in one respect though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence base is indeed growing, But it is almost  all negative evidence. Does the HPC not realise that? And what about “at least  by Western standards”?   Surely the HPC is not suggesting that UK health  policy should be determined by the standards of evidence of Chinese herbalists?  Actually it is doing exactly that since its assessment of evidence was based on the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;Pittilo report&lt;/a&gt; in which the evidence was assessed (very badly) by herbalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One despairs too about the statement that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“there was a recognition in the report that the individualised approach to practice in these areas did not lend themselves to traditional RCT research designs”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes of course the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;Pittilo  report&lt;/a&gt; said that, because it was written by herbalists!  Had the HPC bothered to read Ben Goldacre’s column in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; they would have realised that there is no barrier at all to doing proper tests.  It isn’t rocket science, though it seems that it is beyond the comprehension  of the HPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href="http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf"&gt;followed  the link&lt;/a&gt; to try again to find out why the HPC had reached the decision  to breach its own rules. Page 10 of the HPC Council report says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The occupation must practise based on evidence of efficacy  This criterion covers how a profession practises. The Council recognizes the centrality of evidence-based practice to modern health care and will assess applicant occupations for evidence that demonstrates that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their practice is subject to research into its effectiveness. Suitable evidence would include publication in journals that are accepted as&lt;br&gt;
learned by the health sciences and/or social care communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an established scientific and measurable basis for measuring outcomes of their practice. This is a minimum—the Council welcomes&lt;br&gt;
evidence of there being a scientific basis for other aspects of practice and the body of knowledge of an applicant occupation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It subscribes to the ethos of evidence-based practice, including being open to changing treatment strategies when the evidence is in favour&lt;br&gt;
of doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that sounds fine. Except that research is rarely published in “journals that are accepted as learned by the health sciences”.  And of course most of the good evidence is negative anyway. Nobody with the  slightest knowledge of the literature could possibly think that these criteria  are satisfied by Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese  Medicine Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does the HPC make of the evidence?  Appendix 2 tells us. It goes through the criteria for HPS registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Defined body of knowledge:  There is a defined body of knowledge, although  approaches to practice can vary within each area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no mention that the “body of knowledge” is, in many cases, nonsensical  gobbledygook and, astonishingly this criterion was deemed to be “met”!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This  shows once again the sheer silliness of trying to apply a list of criteria  without first judging whether the subject is based in reality&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of efficacy.    There is limited widely accepted evidence of efficacy, although this could be partly explained by the nature of the professions in offering bespoke treatments to individual patients. This criterion is scored part met overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly we are not told who deemed this criterion to be “part met”.  But it does say that “This scoring has been undertaken based on the information outlined in the [Pittilo] report”.  Since the assessment of evidence in that report  was execrably bad (having been made by people who would lose their jobs if&lt;br&gt;
they said anything negative). it is no wonder that the judgement is overoptimistic!&lt;br&gt;
Did the HPC not notice the quality of the evidence presented in the Pittilo report?   Apparently not.    That is sheer incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the criterion was not “met”, so they can’t join HPC, right?   Not at all. The Council simply decided to ignore its own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 5 of the Council’s report we see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Steering Group [Pittilo] argues that a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base (p.11, p. 32, p.34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question can be a controversial area and the evidence base of these professions was the focus of some press attention following the report’s publication. An often raised argument against regulation in such circumstances is that it would give credibility in the public’s eyes to treatments that are not proven to be safe or efficacious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second point is dead right, but it is ignored.  The Council then goes on to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the HPC’s existing processes, a lack of ‘accepted’ evidence of efficacy is not a barrier to producing standards of proficiency or making decisions about fitness to practise cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This strikes me as ludicrous, incompetent, and at heart, dishonest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no sense in policy in this area until the question of efficacy is referred to NICE.  Why didn’t the HPC recommend that?  Why has it not been done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that I discovered recently that, although there are  two scientific advisers in the Department of Health,. both of them claim that it is “not their role” to give scientific advice in this area.  So the questions get referred instead to the Prince of Wales Foundation.  That is no way to run a ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that the HPC, like so many other regulatory agencies, fails utterly to protect the public from fraudulent and incompetent practitioners. In fact it actually protects them, in the same way that the &lt;a title="Paul Krugman, on Madoff" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/opinion/19krugman.html?_r=1&amp;amp;em"&gt;financial ‘regulators’ protected fraudulent bankers&lt;/a&gt;.  They all seem to think that ticking boxes and passing exams is an effective process. Even if the exams require you to memorise that &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts “emit  high Yin energy&lt;/a&gt; so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbance as all levels of being”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237907205675"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6223">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/59991716a357413d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="music"/><category term="Paul Krugman"/><category term="recession"/><category term="Youtube"/><title type="html">Hey, Paul Krugman</title><published>2009-03-24T13:59:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T13:59:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/d10AmGbqjV8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/hey-paul-krugman/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">As noted here earlier, this recession (depression? repression?) is inspiring some pretty decent pop music.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;… Mable Jamison, an independent notary,&lt;span&gt; testified that Brown phoned her in an effort to dissuade her from collecting&lt;span&gt; absentee ballots from voters that “his people,” such as Windham, intended to&lt;span&gt; collect: “[h]e pretty much said that his people had did the initial leg work and I&lt;span&gt; shouldn’t be picking up his ballots.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to Victor Steinbok. An earlier version of this posting was posted on ADS-L.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two aspects to Jamison's &lt;em&gt;had did&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; plus PSP (past participle), possibly conveying simple past rather than past perfect; and &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; (rather than &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;) as PSP of the verb &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt;. The first of these is a well-known feature of AAVE, but the second hasn't been so much discussed, though it wasn't entirely new to me. The most common (non-standard) leveling of PSP and PST (past) forms for &lt;small&gt;DO&lt;/small&gt; is in favor of &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;quot;I done it yesterday&amp;quot;) — &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;2 lists it as colloquial, dialectal, and U.S. — but here the leveling is in the other direction, in favor of &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, and it's not in the &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call the quotation from Jamison example (1). Here are a few more "had did" examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2) he was really upset that i had did this and sent his goons &lt;span&gt;after me to bring me back to him. (&lt;a href="http://answers.psychcentral.com/story/title/i-had-this-very-strange-dream-and-it-is-still-bothering-me-can-someone-help-me-understand-it"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) omg i would soooo love it if they did "Reden" or "Wo sind eure &lt;span&gt;hande"!!!!! i wish they had did an english version of that song too.. the beat is just so fun and makes me want to dance.. i should &lt;span&gt;go look up the translation for it… (&lt;a href="http://tokiohotel.pop24.de/forum/us/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=8507&amp;amp;p=729014"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) After a year we had did a song with a dude that was singin. [black speaker] (&lt;a href="http://www.murderdog.com/archives/dirty/dirty.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) I didn't realize Cedeno had did that. That's funny. It takes Theriot 2 days to slug that much, wow. ! (&lt;a href="http://www.forums.mlb.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=11&amp;amp;nav=messages&amp;amp;webtag=ml-cubs&amp;amp;tid=351973"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some discussion.  I find the interpretation of (2), like (1), &lt;span&gt;uncertain; (3) looks pretty clearly like a past perfect; (4) seems &lt;span&gt;equally clearly to have AAVE &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;+ PSP used as a simple past; and (5) &lt;span&gt;could go either way, but I'm leaning in favor of the simple past (I &lt;span&gt;don't know what the race of the writer was).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are occurrences of PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; outside of &lt;em&gt;had did&lt;/em&gt;: perfect &lt;em&gt;have/has did&lt;/em&gt; and passives combining a form of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; with &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some perfect examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok i hate this man but i shouldnt have did that? [black writer] (&lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307135111AAw6oBC"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only thing that I could have did that I can think of was &lt;span&gt;clicked on a few sites to unsubscribe(HTML)porn sites … [race of writer unknown] (&lt;a href="http://www.faqs.org/qa/qa-3497.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She shouldn't have did that."  [black speaker] (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BrEpcxEbsQcC&amp;amp;pg=PA140&amp;amp;lpg=PA140&amp;amp;dq=%22have+did+that%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=qbeeuWRl31&amp;amp;sig=Rt7Igbi6WDuPBax3MZIPFsF6SNg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=RLjDScruH5HItQODmbGCBw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes you can try and then you say "I'm tired of trying." I have did that. [black speaker] (&lt;a href="http://www.poverty.smartlibrary.org/newinterface/segment.cfm?segment=1626"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are plenty more — including one wonderful &amp;quot;might would have did that&amp;quot; &lt;span&gt;– most of them clearly from black speakers or writers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some passive examples, in particular with &lt;em&gt;was did&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone knows how to fold paper with After effects like the video at 2:28? I know that maybe that was did by creating a stop-motion sequence but maybe there is a good way to do it in AE too (&lt;a href="http://motionographer.com/2008/07/09/psyop-converse/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original version to &amp;quot;More Like You&amp;quot; was did by Michael Omartian, released in 1977 on his album &amp;quot;Seasons of the Soul&amp;quot; … (&lt;a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Christian-Music-2785/2008/8/song-title-3.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what you did to PSC would be called vandalism if it was did by an anon user … (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Blitzkrieg/archive1"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter further explained that this was did by the God who had raised Jesus … (&lt;a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/h/holy_spirit.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of these, and they don't seem to be particularly race-related. So, at least from a first sampling of the data, the perfect instances (forms of &lt;small&gt;HAVE&lt;/small&gt; plus PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;) seem to be heavily AAVE, while the passive instances (forms of &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; plus PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;) seem to be more generally usable (though both are non-standard) — an interesting split in the way PSP &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamma rays are the 800 pound gorillas of photons&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#grfootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the highest energy form of light. Even the wimpiest gamma ray has about a 500,000 times the energy of a visible light photon, and so you might imagine it takes a pretty seriously scary event to make one. You’d be right: we’re talking exploding stars, black holes being born, flares from stars, super-duper magnetic fields, and the like. Nuclear bombs make them too, but compared those other events, a nuke detonating is small potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why this map this new picture of the sky is so seriously cool: &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gammaray_best.html"&gt;it’s the highest resolution map ever made of the entire sky in gamma rays&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gammaray_best.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/fermi_allsky.jpg" alt="The gamma-ray sky as seen by NASA’s Fermi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map was made with &lt;a href="http://fermi.sonoma.edu/"&gt;Fermi&lt;/a&gt; (what used to be called GLAST when I worked on it), a gamma-ray observatory launched last year. It detects those bullet-like photons that have an energy from 15 million to 150 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; times the energy of the kind of photon you can see with your eye; the gamma rays used to make this map all had energies higher than 150 million times that energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s seriously high-energy indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image was made over the course of three months. Fermi sweeps across the sky, recording the energy and position of every gamma ray it detects. Over time, it builds up a map of the sky in gamma rays. Where it sees more, the map is bright, and where it sees fewer the map is dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s so much to see in the image! The flat line across the center is actually our own Milky Way galaxy. The map has been set up in such a way that the center of the galaxy is the center of the map, and the flat disk we see edge-on because we’re inside it — what we actually do call the Milky Way when we see it at night — runs along the middle. All those gamma rays are coming from incredibly energized gas, old dead supernovae, black holes, ultra-dense neutron stars, and other exotic beasties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are lots of other sources too. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/317870main_Fermi_3_month_labeled_new.jpg"&gt;Go to the high-res version&lt;/a&gt; and look to the upper right. See that thin arc? That’s the Sun! Over time, as the Earth moves around the Sun (and Fermi sticks close to the Earth) the position of the Sun on the sky moves, and the way the map is laid out (in what we call galactic coordinates) the Sun’s motion translates to that arc over the three months it took to create this image. It’s funny — we’re at a minimum of solar activity right now, so in any given gamma ray snapshot of the Sun it would be invisible, lost among all the other solitary dots of gamma rays from the sky. But its motion betrays it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the other bright blobby sources are supernova remnants — Geminga, the Crab, and Vela. The one labeled PSR J1836+5925 (left of center and just above the galactic disk) is a pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star that’s left over from a titanic supernova explosion. Most of the rest are distant galaxies, their central black holes voraciously consuming matter and spitting some of it out in the form of twin beams of energy; if they happen to be aimed right at us we see gamma rays from them, and Fermi detects them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the coolest things in the image, the things that makes scientists squee, are the blobs that are unidentified. Quite a few bright sources in the map are simply unknown, and not identified with any visible source. The reason we can identify so many objects in the map is because when we look with our &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; telescopes, we see something there and can say, &amp;quot;Here be a supernova!&amp;quot; But those unidentified ones? Nope. We look with our optical telescopes and there’s nothing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what scientists live for. These may be a whole new class of object! Or, more likely, something we already know about but behaving in a weird way. A galaxy that spews out gamma rays, but no optical light. Or a pulsar that for some reason sends only super-high-energy light our way, and nothing else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, just maybe, it’s something no one has thought of before. How cool would that be? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/19/swift-bags-most-distant-titanic-explosion-ever-seen/"&gt;Gamma-ray bursts&lt;/a&gt; — unbelievably violent explosions that occur when a black hole is born, and which could vaporize our planet without even blinking — were totally unknown until the 1960s. So who knows what’s still out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With observatories like Fermi, we get a glimpse into the Universe’s more terrifying objects… and what we see is not only incredible, it’s also &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. And that, my friends, is why we do this. We want to understand more and more, but, as a happy circumstance, the only way to do that is to find more things we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the fun is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;a name="grfootnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Come to think of it, if you could actually turn an 800 pound gorilla into photon, it really would be a gamma ray. When you convert an object into energy (which is what a photon really is), the amount of energy you get out is huge for even a tiny amount of mass. An 800 pound gorilla, converted into energy, would explode with the same yield as about 8000 one-megaton nuclear bombs. By definition, any photon above about 500,000 times the energy of a visible light photon is a gamma ray, so if you could somehow squish all that energy from the suddenly energized simian, it would be a gamma ray. And it would be really ticked off.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was an opportune time, coming as it did around the time when he had just published his new blockbuster story about how Andrew Wakefield, architect of the MMR vaccine scare in the U.K., had apparently falsified data for his infamous 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper that started it all. The symposium was entitled &lt;em&gt;Science, the Media and Responsibility for Child Health: Lessons Learned from the MMR Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;, and its was (or so I thought) the role of the press and journals in perpetrating or preventing such scandals and fueling vaccine scares. Sharing the stage with him was Catherine DeAngelis, the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;. I have to admit that I was puzzled by the combination. Deer gave a really entertaining talk about how he first became interested in the Andrew Wakefield case, how he pursued it, and, finally, about the role of irresponsible journalists in promoting the MMR scare based on the truly bad science pushed by Wakefield. Even though it had been raining and I was nearly soaked from my walk from my car to the lecture hall, I enjoyed Deer's talk immensely and even got to speak to him briefly after it was over, before he was whisked away to various social functions. I was also flattered to learn that Deer does from time to time check out this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was Dr. DeAngelis' turn to speak, and it was clear that the two talks really had little or nothing to do with each other. Hers was clearly a generic, canned talk that didn't even reference pediatric issues for the most part. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good talk, but it was clear that she hadn't even made even a slight effort to tailor her talk to her audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started out rather amusingly, displaying this conflict of interest slide (photo taken with my iPhone, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/03/catherine_deangelis_and_jama_bullies/IMG_0097.JPG" width="450" height="338" alt="IMG_0097.JPG"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was half-tempted to construct a slide like that for myself, except that I prefer to joke that no pharmaceutical company has found my research sufficiently interesting or promising to want to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Dr. DeAngelis played her tough-but-lovable Italian mother schtick to a tee, charming the audience and leading it along with her as she discussed conflicts of interest (COIs) in the medical literature, particularly undisclosed COIs. During her talk, she discussed several examples of COIs, disclosed and undisclosed, by authors submitting manuscripts to JAMA and how she dealt with them forthrightly and honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember one anecdote she told in particular about how she fought the influence of big pharma in JAMA because it was the most amusing--and, well, memorable--of the lot. In brief, a story was scheduled to be published in JAMA that reported favorable results for a drug made by a certain pharmaceutical company. Because the company had been involved with the study, it knew the planned publication date of the manuscript. To take advantage of the favorable study, a representative of the pharmaceutical company apparently had been pestering the ad department of JAMA to sell it advertising space in the same issue in which the article was to appear. At this point DeAngelis emphasized that it was JAMA policy that no ads would be sold to a pharmaceutical company whose product was being featured in a study published in JAMA in the same issue in which that study was published. It sounded like quite the reasonable policy, a sensible means of preventing pharmaceutical companies from too blatantly capitalizing on favorable studies and preventing JAMA from being too tempted to jack up its rates and solicit pharmaceutical companies for ads in issues where favorable articles were to appear. Apparently this particular pharmaceutical company's representatives were particularly persistent and annoying; DeAngelis described a call from one of JAMA's advertising sales staff begging her to let him sell the ad and telling her that it was a lot of money for the journal. DeAngelis told him the company could have as many ads as it wanted, just not in that issue, to which the salesman responded that the company was interested only in that issue. DeAngelis then slyly grinned and related to the audience how she told him, in essence, "OK, you can run the ad in that issue." She then told the audience with a grin that immediately after that call she called the publisher and changed the publication date of the study to a different date. Whether her talk was canned or not, I had to admit that she was successfully representing herself as a defender of the integrity of medical publishing, and she even had me believing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I heard about how JAMA deals with criticism when it screws up over--yes, you've got it--undisclosed conflicts of interest (COIs). Then I heard how Dr. DeAngelis called someone who dared to call JAMA out for failure to police its COI disclosure policies adequately a "&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/03/13/jama-editor-calls-critic-a-nobody-and-a-nothing/"&gt;nothing and a nobody&lt;/a&gt;" when questioned about reports that she and another of her editors had tried to intimidate the letter writer and his dean. If the story is true, apparently Dr. DeAngelis' &lt;em&gt;schtick&lt;/em&gt; was just that--&lt;em&gt;schtick&lt;/em&gt;, at least when it comes to her personally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/catherine_deangelis_and_jama.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/catherine_deangelis_and_jama.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/l0ECfLxiYGA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237900495650"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/danish_metal_detector_festival.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7dbbd65696cc8368</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Danish Metal Detector Festival</title><published>2009-03-24T13:20:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T13:20:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/ejwyaYptxB8/danish_metal_detector_festival.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/danish_metal_detector_festival.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/03/danish_metal_detector_festival/Folketidene%2021-3-09%20%20samlet%20artikel.pdf"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/03/danish_metal_detector_festival/Danish%20metal%20detecting.jpg" width="324" height="400" alt="Danish metal detecting.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Denmark has an excellent system in place to enable and govern a responsible and constructive metal detector hobby. While the UK's ploughsoil heritage is largely being trashed by nighthawks (despite the valuable efforts of the &lt;a href="http://www.finds.org.uk/"&gt;Portable Antiquities Scheme&lt;/a&gt;) and Sweden's is left to corrode untouched out in the fields, the Danes organise metal detector festivals, inviting skilled amateurs and professionals alike! One is taking place at Halsted on Lolland between 3 and 5 April. The public is welcome to watch on Saturday the 4th. Rest assured that the international crew of 70 detector-wielding participants will re-write the area's history and later prehistory in those scant three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks to Tobias for the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/03/danish_metal_detector_festival/Folketidene%2021-3-09%20%20samlet%20artikel.pdf"&gt;press clipping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update same day:&lt;/b&gt; A few commenters feel that I've overstated the problem with nighthawking, i.e. clandestine metal detecting, in the UK. I based my assertion on an article on page 5 of the April issue of &lt;i&gt;Current Archaeology&lt;/i&gt; (#229), which reports on a recent investigation by English Heritage:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The survey found that nighthawking was rife on scheduled ancient monuments and 'honey pot' sites (mainly Roman settlements and villas) that have been targeted repeatedly, with considerable damage to crops and fields, as well as to archaeology." There is "... a vicious circle of under-reporting of the crime, which in turn creates a false picture of the seriousness of the situation, making this a low priority crime for the police."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 26 March:&lt;/b&gt; For some perspective on whether the UK nighthawk problem is serious or not, see these links provided by &lt;i&gt;Aard&lt;/i&gt; regular Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://coinarchaeology.blogspot.com/2009/02/some-recent-discussions-about.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=tTm&amp;amp;q=metal+detector+rally&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;meta="&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.detecting.org.uk/html/Metal_Detecting_Rallies_In_The_United_Kingdom.html"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/News/Article.aspx?articleID=5141"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the nighthawks, of course the UK has major legislative problems in this area. Landowners own all finds (!) and the archaic "treasure trove" law presupposes an interpretation by the county coroner of &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; each individual find was buried back in the day.

&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Four people ranging in age from 19 to 21 were killed early yesterday in Culpeper County, Va., when their car collided with a vehicle that was going the wrong way, Virginia State Police said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Police said a Chevy Tahoe sport-utility vehicle was driving on the wrong side of a two-lane stretch of Route 3 when it struck the Toyota Corolla about 2:50 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpert's suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Just based on the facts in the Post article, we can say, "A 29 year old man was driving his Chevy Tahoe SUV on the wrong side of Route 3 early yesterday when he struck and killed four people in a Toyota Corolla." Why can't the printing press at the Washington Post say that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Close reading of Alpert's post suggests that he may know what &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;passive voice&lt;/span&gt; means, unlike most of the contemporary intellectuals who complain about it (e.g. Nancy Franklin in the 3/23/2009 issue of the New Yorker, discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1242"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or the bloggers discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000991.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000236.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  At least, in two out of three cases where Alpert specifically complains about the passive voice, there is actually a passive-voice construction somewhere in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in his proposed edit replaces the passive "were killed" by the active "struck and killed". And his complaint about the language of medical reports also correctly identifies two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Many fields use too much passive voice. MRI reports, for example, read like this: "Mild Straightening of the cervical lordosis is demonstrated. Mild mucosal thickening is incidentally noted at the floor of the sphenoid sinuses." The straightening didn't observe itself. The doctor observed it. Why not just say that on the report?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The answer, of course, is that the report is about the straightening or the thickening, not about the doctor; but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Alpert also gives us this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;After doctors, journalists writing about car crashes seem to overuse passive voice the most. Though we only seem to do this for cars, not for bicycles. In the excellent book &lt;a href="http://tomvanderbilt.com/traffic/"&gt;Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us&lt;/a&gt;), author Tom Vanderbilt (and not any inanimate object) writes,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:80px;font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In a study, [Ian Walker of the University of Bath in England] had subjects look at various photographs of traffic and describe what was going on. When subjects saw a photograph with a car, they were more likely to refer to the photo's subject as a thing. When subjects looked at a picture that showed a pedestrian or a cyclist, they were more likely to use language that described a person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about reference, personification, focus, and many other things, but it has nothing to do with voice, passive or otherwise. So maybe Alpert's correct identification of passive voice in the other two cases was just good luck. And he ends in this grammatically unpromising way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[O]ur habit of dehumanizing the actions of cars tends to create assumptions that their actions are not actually someone's responsibility. A driver hit and killed some people in another car in Culpeper. It's extremely unlikely his car magically malfunctioned. And even if it did, we don't engage in the same linguistic contortions to say, for example, that a police officer's bullet impacted a suspected robber, who had himself been holding a gun which fired into someone else earlier in the day. That would be silly. So is this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But choosing whether to say that someone was killed by a driver or a car or a collision — or by a shooter or a gun or a bullet — is not a choice of active or passive voice, it&amp;#39;s a choice about how to attribute agency, as well as a choice about how to focus a description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these choices tend to be made differently in writing about cars and and about guns, that's probably  because vehicle collisions are typically somewhat more complex events than gunshots are, and the attribution of intent and moral responsibility is typically more difficult. Indeed, especially when the description focuses on the details of the event, or agency and intent are unclear, news stories often do talk about guns and bullets as agents or at least grammatical subjects. Thus &lt;a href="http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/norwalkadvocate/news/ci_11926611"&gt;a recent news story&lt;/a&gt; about a shooting incident includes sentences like these, where a bullet and a gun are the subjects of active verbs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The .45-caliber bullet entered&lt;/strong&gt; an adjacent unit, &lt;strong&gt;passing&lt;/strong&gt; within 12 feet of a man eating dinner on his living room couch, then &lt;strong&gt;lodged&lt;/strong&gt; in another wall, Lt. Sean Cooney said. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Cooney said Milligan called police at about 7:30 p.m. Thursday to report &lt;strong&gt;his gun had discharged&lt;/strong&gt;. Milligan told investigators that he invited Getting into his apartment to see his gun collection, Cooney said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;During the visit, Milligan handed Getting the gun, which Milligan recently purchased, and &lt;strong&gt;it discharged&lt;/strong&gt;, Cooney said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.semissourian.com/article/20090324/NEWS01/703249993"&gt;Another story&lt;/a&gt;, this one about a murder trial, features the passive "was shot", and an active sentence attributing grammatical agency to the bullet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In his opening argument, assistant attorney general Kevin Zoellner said Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. was ambushed in his driveway March 20, 2005, after completing his shift for the day. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Graham was shot&lt;/span&gt; in the back with a high-powered rifle and suffered a skull fracture when he fell backward from the impact. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The bullet severed&lt;/span&gt; his spine, Zoellner said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not, I think,  because the prosecutor is dehumanizing the actions of the rifle and the bullet, but because that's how law, or at least legal custom, prescribes that a murder case should be framed. Attributions of moral responsibility follow soon after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"A coward shot him in the back," Zoellner said, then with a shotgun pumped two shots into his head, peppering Graham's face with shotgun pellets. "His name is Lance Shockley and he's sitting here," Zoellner said, pointing to Shockley, who wore a blue dress shirt and brown slacks, seated between his defense team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in news reports of fatal vehicle collisions, moral responsibility is often flagged separately from the description of the sequence of events in the collision. Thus I'm not convinced that there's even a statistical correlation between indication of apparent human moral responsibility and use of active vs. passive voice.  Attribution of apparent agency to vehicles probably tends to correlate negatively with attribution of agency to humans, at the single-clause level, but I'm not entirely sure about even that much. Some random examples from today's Google News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A wrong-way driver was killed in a head-on collision in El Sereno Monday night &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[+responsibility, -personification, +passive]&lt;/span&gt;, and a 50-year-old woman and her daughter in her 20s suffered minor injuries &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[-responsibility, -personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A truck’s brakes stopped working at Corredor Norte, near the San Miguelito entrance, colliding with two cars on Saturday &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[-responsibility, +personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt;. One of the cars was carrying three adults and one child [-responsibility, +personification, -passive]. Both the truck and the car instantly caught fire, killing all of the car’s passengers &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[-responsibility, +personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt;.  The truck was driven by Joseph Nataniel Donalson, currently under police investigation &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[+responsibility, -personification, +passive]&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;At around 4 p.m. Jacob Ryan White, a resident of Stansbury Park, was driving along state Route 138 when police say he apparently fell asleep, causing his car to cross into oncoming traffic and strike another vehicle head-on, said trooper Clint Sawson with the Tooele County Sheriff's Office &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[+responsibility, +personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are even some cases in such reports where grammatical agency is attributed to drivers who may have been dead at the time of the accident, as here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A 67-year-old visitor from Alaska died Friday &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[-responsibility, -personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt; after being involved in a two-vehicle collision on Akoni Pule Highway &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[-responsibility, -personification, +passive].&lt;/span&gt; … officers determined that the victim was operating a 2008 Mercury four-door sedan and traveling north on Akoni Pule Highway when he ran off the right side of the road, struck a guardrail, crossed the centerline and collided into a 2006 Chevrolet bus traveling south &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;[+responsibility, -personification, -passive]&lt;/span&gt; … Police are going to wait for the results of the autopsy to see if the victim died from a medical condition or from injuries in the crash before counting this death as a traffic fatality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Alpert presumably believes that that civic virtue would be increased if the caption for the picture below, instead of being &amp;quot;Two vehicles collided head-on Saturday afternoon near Stansbury in Tooele County, claiming the lives of three people and injuring a fourth&amp;quot;, were — what?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href="http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705292593,00.html"&gt;the accompanying story&lt;/a&gt;, maybe his prescription would be &amp;quot;By falling asleep at the wheel, Jacob Ryan White was said to have caused this head-on collision, claiming the lives of three other people and injuring himself&amp;quot; — even though the original caption was entirely in the active voice, and the main verb of the proposed substitution is passive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure whether Alpert is right about the value of publicly naming and shaming drivers with various levels of apparent culpability for serious collisions.  But either way, I'm positive that this has nothing whatever to do with the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22passive+voice%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;unjustly maligned passive voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237899452561"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_633.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea3829838edfeaab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-03-24T12:56:17Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T12:56:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Xtja7wgrQSQ/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_633.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_633.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_633.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_633.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Xtja7wgrQSQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237891559484"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-8937012139021339374">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49a6dd5620fab8e9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Metablog" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Link Love" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Ack!</title><published>2009-03-24T09:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T09:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/03/ack.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt;, I'm busy.

Deinstitutionalization was intended to restore their civil rights and improve their lot. Did it? By 2006, there were only 40,000 people in institutions. What happened to the other 518,000?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are living in the community with supportive family members, taking their medications, and contributing to society. Some of them have been ghettoized in halfway houses or group homes in crime-ridden and run-down neighborhoods. Some of them are homeless, living on the streets and eating out of garbage cans. Some of them are in jail. Some of them have killed family members or have killed multiple people in “rampage” murders provoked by their psychotic delusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate numbers are difficult to obtain. By some estimates, as many as 30-50% of the homeless (and even more of the hard-core homeless) and as many as 40-50% of the jail population are mentally ill. There are more mentally ill people in jails than in hospitals. The mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence and rape and are more likely to be shot by the police in “justifiable homicide” incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentally ill people who are adequately treated are no more violent than the non-mentally ill, but a disproportionate number of murders are committed by the mentally ill. The risk of violence increases with past history of violence, substance abuse, anosognosia with medication noncompliance, antisocial personality disorder, paranoid symptoms, and male sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil rights advocates argue that patients with other illnesses like heart disease or cancer have the right to refuse treatment – but those patients presumably are capable of understanding that they are ill. About half of psychotic patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill – the lack of insight or anosognosia is part of their disease, similar to the anosognosia of a stroke patient whose brain damage makes him unable to recognize that he is paralyzed on one side. If you truly believe you are God, you’re not about to let anyone give you pills intended to make you think otherwise. If you can’t recognize that you are ill, why would you accept treatment for a condition you firmly believe you do not have? Are we really giving these patients their civil rights, or are we denying them their right to be treated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for involuntary treatment – TB patients are a prime example. If they refuse medication or take it inconsistently they are putting their communities at risk, so the courts allow compulsory treatment under direct supervision. The Virginia Tech shooter had been hospitalized after harassing two female students and was under court order to get outpatient treatment; the University knew about the court order but did not enforce it. We can never know for sure, but there is a good chance that if he had been forced to take antipsychotic medication his 32 victims would still be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become next to impossible to get a patient involuntarily committed. You have to show that they are an immediate danger to themselves or others. When they are committed, the typical course is that they are given medication, their symptoms subside, they are discharged, they go off their meds, and the symptoms recur. One police officer described picking up the same woman and taking her to the hospital 16 times for lying down in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put a human face on the dilemma, imagine you are the parent of a paranoid schizophrenic who has been repeatedly hospitalized and jailed, whose psychotic symptoms disappear when he takes his meds but who refuses to take them. He has repeatedly threatened to kill you and other family members, saying God wants him to root out the evil. You awaken in the middle of the night to find him hovering menacingly over your bed. He sleeps with an ax. He regularly gets drunk and disorderly. He has battered down the door of your apartment in the middle of the night, causing your landlord to evict you. You are desperately afraid for your life and for the lives of your family members. You have repeatedly pleaded with police and mental health authorities for help, and all they do is tell you to make him take his meds – which you can’t do. Society will do nothing to help you until he actually hurts someone. Families have even moved out and left the house to the mentally ill person, but it did no good – he followed them. One woman had a psychotic brother who had repeatedly threatened to kill her only daughter; she believed the threats and was desperate to save her daughter’s life. After years of fruitlessly begging for help from every available resource, she ran out of options, killed her brother and went to jail for murder. Imagine pleading repeatedly and unsuccessfully with the authorities to get treatment for your wife and coming home to find she has killed all your children because Satan told her to. Imagine begging authorities for help because your son has threatened his mother, being told he does not meet the criteria for involuntary commitment, and then coming home to find he has beaten his mother to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, mentally ill people have civil rights, but so do their families and other victims.&lt;/strong&gt; There are effective, humane programs for outpatient treatment of the mentally ill, and some have ingenious incentive programs to increase medication compliance. Unfortunately, these programs only reach a tiny fraction of the patients at risk. And unfortunately, it is the most dangerous patients who are the least likely to recognize that they are ill and the most likely to refuse treatment. Surely as a society we can do more to help these unfortunate patients and their just-as-unfortunate families and victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is wrong to confine patients against their will. But, as Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be remembered that for the person with severe mental illness who has no treatment, the most dreaded of confinements can be the imprisonment inflicted by his own mind, which shuts reality out and subjects him to the torment of voices and images beyond our powers to describe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the creators of a strict state statute later said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted the LPS act to help the mentally ill. I never meant for it to prevent those who need care from receiving it. The law has to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Stephen Rachlin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paramount civil right of the patient should be that of adequate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are abandoning sick patients to live on the streets, forage from garbage cans, and bounce in and out of jail, and we are exposing our society to unnecessary violence. Surely we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1994 I was at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where I had a year-long fellowship to work on my dissertation. The Classics department was in Steton Hall, and in its basement was the mailroom where, from time to time, I'd see a small blond woman putting letters into the mailboxes and carrying around bins of mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know it, but that woman was most likely &lt;a href="http://www.jessicapark.com/"&gt;Jessica Park&lt;/a&gt;, the painter whose life has been chronicled by her mother, Clara Claiborne Park, in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316690694/ref=sim_books/107-6376146-5405360"&gt;The Siege: A Family's Journey Into the World of an Autistic Child&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.jessicapark.com/exiting.html"&gt;Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316690694/ref=sim_books/107-6376146-5405360"&gt;The Siege&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first accounts by the mother of an autistic child that I read and I've remembered Park's careful charting of her daughter's days, in a time when parents were routinely blamed for causing a child to become autistic. The Parks raised their youngest daughter at home, and as I read, I'd picture the streets of Williamstown, lined with woodframe houses and quaint storefronts, and the understated buildings of Williams College. This was where Park grew up and some of the Victorian houses in Wiliamstown are the subjects of her paintings, depicted in the precise patterns of color and shape that are features of all of her work----you can see examples on &lt;a href="http://www.jessicapark.com/prints.html"&gt;Jessica Park's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park was featured in an article (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_7"&gt;noted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by Dora) in last Sunday's &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/03/22/for_an_artist_with_autism_precision_is_all/?page=1"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; which notes her interest in "abstract shapes and color gradations" and numbers as a child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..........her room is a window on what she calls enthusiasms and others call obsessions. Her previous enthusiasms - the subjects of Park's early paintings - include radiators, dials, and heaters. In recent years, Park's artwork has been dominated by Victorian houses surrounded by weather anomalies and set against night skies made of "purplish black," her favorite color. The skies are invariably filled with stars, painstakingly depicted in their correct positions and dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, posters of "rainbows, lightning, Las Vegas, and astronomical phenomena" cover the walls of Park's bedroom and studio, and dozens of containers of body creams and perfumes are lined up on her dresser. The &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/03/22/for_an_artist_with_autism_precision_is_all/?page=3"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; article notes that Park "would rather talk about the difference between perfume and eau de toilette" than discuss herself as the "gripping subject of books, a film, and gallery exhibitions," and why not, as the former are what interest her and, I think, offer more insight into her art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.jessicapark.com/exiting.html"&gt;Exiting Nirvana&lt;/a&gt;, Clara Park describes her daughter's system of "flavor tubes" (lemon, rice pudding, blueberry) and it's from studying the patterns of color and form in her paintings that I've gotten a better sense about how my own son takes in the world. He has always been attentive to &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3127531998/"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt; and taste and texture and smell and not only &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3126705039/"&gt;organizes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3202472247/"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; according to these; by understanding what this order means to him, I feel I've been able to understand him more. As Jessica Park's brother, Paul Park (a writer of science fiction) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an autistic person's paradise, 50 [skin care] products at each counter [at the mall]. Is this one a.m. or p.m.? Before or after bath? Cream or powder? Everything has a category with tiny gradations, and because she's got a powerful intellect Jessy turns it into a system that she invests in. She's the same way with bathroom cleansers and appliances and vitamin pills.......It's the way she does her art."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same with Charlie. Everyone who knows him well, from his teacher to Jim and me, knows he's got a "powerful intellect" driving what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And slowly, slowly, I do think, like Jessica Park, Charlie's figuring out how to tell us about all that he sees and knows.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237878891470"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2632">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4dabf9ad84c54a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Jerry Falwell"/><category term="Kevin Roose"/><category term="Liberty University"/><category term="The Unkikely Disciple"/><title type="html">Friendly Atheist interviews The Unlikely Disciple</title><published>2009-03-24T05:46:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T05:46:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/friendly-atheist-interviews-the-unlikely-disciple/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/21/spring-break-jesus-style/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/roose.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/roose.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="445"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A few days ago I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the excerpt from Kevin Roose’s new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044617842X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=044617842X"&gt;The Unlikely Disciple: A Sinner’s Semester at America’s Holiest University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Salon Magazine.

I explained in detail &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/carrboro_citizen_a_model_for_t.php" title=""&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; their model and why I think this is the future of journalism. Now, the Editor, Kirk Ross, gives us the &lt;a href="http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/2009/03/23/letter-from-the-editor-the-future-of-journalism/" title=""&gt;inside story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can't be in this business without wondering how much wilder the ride can get. I've written about this before, so I'll spare you the wind up. The talking points are that &lt;strong&gt;not every newspaper is in trouble and that most that are hurting are chain-owned metro dailies burdened by debt brought on by a mergers-and-acquisition craze&lt;/strong&gt; reminiscent of the Dutch tulip bubble.

&lt;p&gt;-----------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, when we started that was a pretty lonely place. Some of the better business minds in the area were quick to point out that we were daft since print is a dying part of the information industry. Our contention was then, and is now, that print may be shrinking, but it is hardly dying. Having the opportunity to start from scratch, post Internet, provided us with the chance to incorporate a lot of hard-learned lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all that and the print product too would be worthless without the one thing that gives purpose to our endeavor: journalism. &lt;strong&gt;It is quality work, solid reporting and good storytelling that empties the racks each week. Technological advances can enhance that, but not replace it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is anything that underlines the insanity of the current situation in newspapers, it's seeing another round of layoffs at a paper that is still turning a profit. I've had a lot of very sobering discussions of late with young people interested in taking up journalism. They are genuinely worried, and rightly so. They know that for the near term their chosen profession is on shifting sands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hold in your hand the first issue of the third volume of The Carrboro Citizen. Each week, more than 5,000 people like you prove to those students and to us that there is a future for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphases mine. Yes, this is the only newspaper I read in hardcopy. And the only newspaper I truly enjoy reading instead of cussing and cursing at the idiotic coverage of news or silly editorials which other papers serve. May they publish on paper forever!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/carrboro_citizen_-_the_hyperlo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/G0cVlRUHkeA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237872727853"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/23/happy-anniversary-universe-today/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3820418fa0f3bb27</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Happy Anniversary, Universe Today!</title><published>2009-03-24T05:16:59Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T05:16:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/23/happy-anniversary-universe-today/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is what I get for reading my RSS feeds too late: today (as I still write this, barely) is &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/23/universe-today-turns-10/"&gt;Universe Today’s 10th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/23/universe-today-turns-10/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/ut_logo.jpg" alt="Universe Today logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. It’s not an exaggeration at all to say I owe pretty much everything to Fraser Cain, who started UT. He called me out of the blue back in 2000, talking about ways to help each other. He started an advertising network before websites had ads, really, and while it didn’t last long there was a month or two there where the extra money really helped. Fraser convinced me to start a newsletter (also urged by Jeff Golick, the editor on my first book) and also talked me into eventually turning it into a blog. I still remember the conversation we had when he had to twist my arm into writing more than one blog post a day. Hard to believe, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/fraser_me_canada_2007.jpg" alt="Fraser and me in Canada, 2007"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser and I have one rule, and when he’s trying to talk me into something, he always says, &amp;quot;What’s the rule?&amp;quot;, and, wearily but resigned to the truth, I reply: &amp;quot;Fraser is always right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. He was always right there, just ahead of the curve of the web, always giving me advice, always wanting to help both of us. When we merged our bulletin boards into &lt;a href="http://www.bautforum.com"&gt;the Bad Astronomy/Universe Today forum&lt;/a&gt;, he was the driving force, and the one who did almost all the work (I’m fairly useless with such things and probably would have somehow set fire to the forum if allowed to run around unsupervised). He started &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/carnival-of-space/"&gt;the Carnival of Space&lt;/a&gt;, now nearing the 100th episode. He started &lt;a href="http://www.astronomycast.com/"&gt;the Astronomy Cast podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and asked me to partner with him. I was swamped with work, and regretfully turned him down. But hey, I told him, I know this awesome astronomer named &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt; who is looking to do an astronomy podcast; you should talk to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I got to repay at least some of Fraser’s monumental help to me with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap! I just remembered that it was at Dragon*Con in 2006 when Fraser and I met &lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com/"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt; together, too. Wow. That’s where I met &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/"&gt;Derek and Swoopy&lt;/a&gt; in real life for the first time, too. Fraser’s been around for a lot of world-changing web-based events for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest decisions I have ever made in my life was to move to Discover Magazine, because it meant I couldn’t do a lot of the stuff Fraser and I had always done together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still doing things together. We’ve gone to professional astronomy meetings and live-blogged them (and shared more than one hotel room together, too). He’s visited me IRL, and me him. We don’t chat nearly as often as I’d like, but we’re still there for each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser, for everything you’ve done for me, well, &lt;em&gt;thanks&lt;/em&gt;. Universe Today is a monster success, one of if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; biggest and best astronomy news sites on the web. It’s popular because it deserves to be, well-designed because Fraser wouldn’t have it any other way, and still a great read because he’s involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237870829392"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a04b18bcd32980bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Seeing Red</title><published>2009-03-24T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/485-seeing-red.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/169/6/543"&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine reported that a new study&lt;/a&gt; confirmed previous studies that showed a correlation between consuming a large amount of red meat and a shorter life.

&lt;p&gt;It was from &lt;a href="http://www.consumerfreedom.com/pressRelease_detail.cfm/release/256"&gt;The Center for Consumer Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, a “nonprofit coalition supported by restaurants, food companies, and consumers, working together to promote personal responsibility and protect consumer choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And basically they said: eh, no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were a boy growing up in the late ’80s or early ’90s, odds are you had a crush on &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=danica+mckellar&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danica McKellar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She played &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=winnie+cooper+wonder+years&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winnie Cooper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the object of Fred Savage’s obsession on “&lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=the+wonder+years&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;The Wonder Years&lt;/a&gt;.” The nostalgia-fueled sitcom has been off the air since ‘93, but Ms. McKeller still has legions of fans. Today, most of them are heartbroken. Their fair Winnie is officially &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20267146,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines"&gt;off the market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shapingyouth.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/danica_mckellar_2.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.shapingyouth.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/danica_mckellar_2.gif" alt="" width="268" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was indeed a boy growing up in the late ’80s or early ’90s, and yes, I had a crush on Danica McKellar. The man who’s taken Winnie off the market is composer Mike Verta. I also found this portion of the article rather funny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maid of honor got some love as well. Danica’s sister, &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=crystal+mckellar&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal McKellar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was in the wedding party. Crystal is best known for playing Kevin’s ex-girlfriend turned archrival, &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=becky+slater&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;Becky Slater&lt;/a&gt;. She memorably punched Kevin in the stomach after he broke up with her. Fans of the show haven’t forgotten about the oft-spurned Becky. After news of the wedding hit, queries surged on “&lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=crystal+mckellar+photos&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;crystal mckellar photos&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of The Wonder Years gang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b105621_wonder_years_winnie_weds.html?sid=rss_topstories&amp;amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss_topstories"&gt;E! Online&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Savage (now a director of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462244/"&gt;dubious talents&lt;/a&gt;) didn’t attend the wedding, but his TV parents, &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=dan+lauria&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;Dan Lauria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=alley+mills&amp;amp;cs=bz&amp;amp;fr=buzz"&gt;Alley Mills&lt;/a&gt;, were there. No word on Josh Saviano, who played Kevin’s best friend, Paul Pfeiffer. Regardless, queries surged on the Pfeif. Also spiking: the popular urban legend that states that Mr. Saviano and shock-rocker Marilyn Manson are actually one and the same. &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/marilyn.asp"&gt;They’re not&lt;/a&gt;, but the truth is a lot scarier: Saviano is now a &lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2006/03/16/paul_pfieffer_l.php"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:ZeHECd7fAPp-zM:http://www.mathgoodies.com/images/mckellar_bookcover_large.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:ZeHECd7fAPp-zM:http://www.mathgoodies.com/images/mckellar_bookcover_large.jpg" alt="" width="89" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Since the show that made her famous Danica has coauthored a scientific paper, the results of which are termed the ‘Chayes-McKellar-Winn theorem. She’s also written 2 books, &lt;em&gt;Math Doesn’t Suck: How to Survive Middle-School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail&lt;/em&gt;, which encourages girls in middle school to enjoy and succeed at mathematics and &lt;em&gt;Kiss My Math: Showing Pre-Algebra Who’s Boss. &lt;/em&gt;The first, she said she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I just received confirmation today in a letter from the Open Records Office at the University of Oklahoma. The letter confirms that on the day of Dawkins’ speech, Oklahoma State Representative Rebecca Hamilton requested substantial information relating to the speech from Vice President for Governmental Relations Danny Hilliard. Representative Hamilton’s exhaustive request included demands for all e-mails and correspondence relating to the speech; a list of all money paid to Dawkins and the entities, public or private, responsible for this funding; and the total cost to the university, including, among other things, security fees, advertising, and even “faculty time spent promoting this event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Farmer, the director of committee staff for the Oklahoma House of Representatives, also wrote the University on March 12, requesting confirmation that Dawkins had indeed waived all compensation for the speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, being an atheist and one of the most respected scientists in the world makes you a danger to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now some of you–though I hope not too many–may wonder: “What’s wrong with the legislature investigating a speech by a famous evolutionary biologist at a public university?” Well, a lot of things, actually. As I wrote in my post on Dawkins’ website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this investigation is indeed taking place, what the state legislature needs to understand is that in court cases dating back to the days of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, even investigating clearly protected speech on the basis of its viewpoint violates the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: If every time a student or faculty member invited, say, Rick Warren to speak on campus, they knew they would be subjected to a thorough and time-consuming investigation by state officials, you can all but guarantee that schools across the country would think twice before inviting Rick Warren. This would be a great way for state legislatures to chill speech they dislike without ever having to find the speaker guilty of a single thing. Talk about your un-American activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the fact the legislature clearly is concerned with nothing other than Dawkins’ viewpoint, such an investigation is improper and should end immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man who heads an institution with an &lt;a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/7047/the-vaticans-top-exorcist-sends-the-devil-packing"&gt;official top exorcist&lt;/a&gt; is asking Africans to &lt;a href="http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=d1f6f272-055c-466d-9acf-2f7aea5319cc"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“shun witchcraft”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and to reject fear-mongering talk of evil entities…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his homily, he urged his listeners to reach out to those Angolans who believe in witchcraft and spirits. &lt;span&gt;“So many of them are living in fear of spirits, of malign and threatening powers. In their bewilderment they even end up condemning street children and the elderly as alleged sorcerers,”&lt;/span&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, I look forward to listening to The Pope explain that warewolves don’t exist after getting off the phone with his official vampire slayer. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;

But that’s not to say that New Scientist is incapable of publishing some great opinion articles like &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20127006.600-fears-over-designer-babies-leave-children-suffering.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on how the superstitious fears of soon-to-be parents can lead them to pass up safe genetic alterations to weed out hundreds of potential genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can parents stand by and let their children die instead of doing all in their power to get the best medical care available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this is precisely what society is doing. We now have the ability to ensure that children are born free of any one of hundreds of serious genetic disorders, from cystic fibrosis to early-onset cancers. But children continue to be born with these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All would-be parents should be offered screening to alert them to any genetic disorders they risk passing on to their children. Those at risk should then be offered IVF with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (IVF-PGD) to ensure any children are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month Barack Obama gave an amazing speech about the importance of science, but the 1 glaring exception I and many scientists took to his speech was the part where he went out of his way to condemn cloning. I imagine he figured this was a benign way of pandering to the religious right during a speech he knew they’d otherwise hate, but such statements aren’t benign. What’s the harm in demonizing cloning and other genetic research? The unnecessary suffering of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....At nearly every fisheries management meeting he attends, Baker hears the same complaint: North Carolina's recreational fishermen don't have to account for their catch. Two years ago, during a regional meeting about snapper and grouper, Baker looked down at his hands and finally saw a possible answer: his mobile phone.

&lt;p&gt;"I wondered if you could send a text message to a computer database somewhere instead of just texting from phone to phone," he says. "And if you could do that, maybe that was something recreational fishermen could do to track their catches and fishing effort."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial fishermen and seafood dealers must submit extensive paperwork tracking what they bring in on a daily basis. But there is no such requirement in the recreational industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------snip-------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker first shared his text messaging idea with friend Ian Oeschger, a software developer. A self-described "nerdy person," Oeschger was intrigued. He agreed to build a system to accept text messages from anglers and translate that information into data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When I think of an idea that seems juicy like that, I just can't help myself," Oeschger says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With funding from a North Carolina Sea Grant minigrant, Baker and Oeschger designed a pilot project to test their idea. The pair asked six Wilmington-area charter boat captains to use pre-paid mobile phones to text their fishing reports to an online text messaging service called "Twitter" (www.twitter.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free service, Twitter allows people to connect with each other through "micro-blogging," or posting messages that are no more than 140 characters. Once used primarily by teenagers and Blackberry addicts, "tweeting" is entering the mainstream -- NASA even has a Twitter account posting status updates for high profile projects like the Mars I-Rover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Baker and Oeschger, Twitter provided an ideal online "collection bin" for the anglers' experimental texts. Oeschger then built a separate database to continually query Twitter for new updates and put data into useable form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most of the work was figuring out, 'What does the data need to do?' and 'What is the most concise way for fishermen to communicate?'" Oeschger explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, he and Baker designed a compact syntax for fishermen to text in their reports, thereby minimizing reporting time and allowing for more content to be submitted in a single text message. For example, N2 E4 FA8R BL3 WEx20 translates to: Two anglers fished (N2), They fished for four hours (E4), They released eight false albacore (FA8R), they kept three Bluefish (BL3), and they kept one 20-inch weakfish (WEx20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an 18-week period, the charter captains submitted 128 trip reports describing 1957 finfish catches - 1123 were kept, 834 released. The captains describe the system as convenient, cost efficient and timely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------snip---------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to more accurate data, the immediacy of text-message based reporting systems may help all fishermen feel a greater sense of ownership when it comes to management decisions, Baker points out. Extensive paperwork for commercial fishermen and third person reports from the recreational industry's MRIP can take several weeks or months to process. During that time, fisheries may be opened and closed based on old data, something that affects livelihoods on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By having fishermen report data in a fast and efficient manner, you make them a greater part of the management process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Read the entire text for more details. This strikes me as a really innovative and useful application of Twitter. Hopefully it will spawn other copy-cats by people who can put microblogging platforms to a good use in scientific, medical or environmental fields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/an_innovative_use_of_twitter_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/zlI7scnfwhA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237865572814"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/150c6edfa75b9f6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">So long, and thanks for all the fish</title><published>2009-03-24T03:05:30Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T03:05:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/OVRd5gPsQEc/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another tectonic shift just occurred today in the science blogging ecosystem - Chris and Sheril have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/the_intersection_moves_to_disc.php" title=""&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that they have moved &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;The Intersection&lt;/a&gt; from scienceblogs.com to the new digs on Discover (joining the likes of Bad Astronomy, The Loom and Cosmic Variance) at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2001, Charles Vest, then President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, announced that MIT would make most of its course material freely available online. Browsing the Web site of MIT's Open Courseware (OCW) project (http://ocw.mit.edu), you feel the stirring of a "my God, it's full of stars" transformation: you can borrow material for your courses, study other teachers' teaching methods, maybe even retake college courses you regret having slept through! Remarkably, OCW is just one highly visible part of an "open education movement." The essays collected in Opening Up Education, edited by Toru Iiyoshi and M.S. Vijay Kumar, describe ways in which individuals and institutions intend to exploit digital communications technology, develop innovative and freely redistributable educational methods and resources, and improve education at all levels throughout the world.

&lt;p&gt;But what does "open education" really mean? What is "closed" about education? Should education be free as in no cost, or is there something about education that needs to be freed as in freedom? This sort of ground is already well-trampled by debates about two better-known "open" predecessors, open-source software and open-access publication, and it is instructive to make the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000076" title=""&gt;Going With the Glow: How Bacteria Integrate Molecular Signals to Synchronize Bioluminescence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a long day in the microbiology lab, Vibrio harveyi may just want to relax, but if enough of its neighbors are game for a group project, it just can't say no. V. harveyi is a bioluminescent marine bacterium that uses a chemical peer-pressure process called quorum sensing to determine whether to emit light and carry out other collective activities. Quorum sensing, which occurs in other bacteria as well, is both fascinating in itself and instructive for an array of disciplines from entomology to robotics. It goes like this: Quorum-sensing bacteria release small molecules called autoinducers. These molecules convey the presence of the cells to neighboring bacteria. When enough autoinducer molecules float around in the extracellular medium, the bacteria, sensing a critical mass, produce a synchronized response--in V. harveyi's case, this response is a group glow.

&lt;p&gt;Quorum sensing in bacteria that respond to a single autoinducer is understood fairly well to cause changes in gene expression that are induced by the accumulated autoinducer. V. harveyi, however, uses three autoinducers to get its herd mentality message across. The three autoinducers, called AI-1, CAI-1, and AI-2, are detected by the transmembrane receptors LuxN, CqsS, and LuxPQ, respectively, which then inhibit the transcription of genes whose products, in turn, block the production of another protein, LuxR. When the autoinducer concentration "tipping point" is reached, gene transcription is inhibited sufficiently and thus LuxR is produced, causing the bacteria to glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world and one of the greatest global public health problems. The Plasmodium falciparum parasite causes approximately 500 million cases each year and over one million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 40% of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The parasite is transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. These insects inject a life stage of the parasite called sporozoites, which invade human liver cells where they reproduce briefly. The liver cells then release merozoites (another life stage of the parasite), which invade red blood cells. Here, they multiply again before bursting out and infecting more red blood cells, causing fever and damaging vital organs. The infected red blood cells also release gametocytes, which infect mosquitoes when they take a blood meal. In the mosquito, the gametocytes multiply and develop into sporozoites, thus completing the parasite's life cycle. Malaria can be prevented by controlling the mosquitoes that spread the parasite and by avoiding mosquito bites by sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets. Effective treatment with antimalarial drugs also helps to decrease malaria transmission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Approximately 36% of East Asians (Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans) show a characteristic physiological response to drinking alcohol that includes facial flushing (see Figure 1), nausea, and tachycardia [1] . This so-called alcohol flushing response (also known as "Asian flush" or "Asian glow") is predominantly due to an inherited deficiency in the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) [2]. Although clinicians and the East Asian public generally know about the alcohol flushing response (e.g., http://www.echeng.com/asianblush/), few are aware of the accumulating evidence that ALDH2-deficient individuals are at much higher risk of esophageal cancer (specifically squamous cell carcinoma) from alcohol consumption than individuals with fully active ALDH2. This is particularly unfortunate as esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide [3], with five-year survival rates of 15.6% in the United States, 12.3% in Europe, and 31.6% in Japan [4].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000052" title=""&gt;Guidelines for Field Surveys of the Quality of Medicines: A Proposal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been relatively little apparent interest in the quality of medicines used to treat common life-threatening diseases despite the logical implication that poor-quality medicines will reduce the effectiveness of therapy and encourage drug resistance. Evidence suggests that a significant proportion of drugs consumed in the developing world are of poor quality [1-25]. Translating evidence on drug treatment outcomes into treatment policy is futile if the medicines actually used have substantially inferior efficacy compared with the medicines originally evaluated [7]. Poor-quality medicines are conventionally classified into three main categories: counterfeit, substandard, and degraded (Box 1).&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_biolo_37.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TxMrv_nOmq0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237865572813"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_140.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c325bffa2e5d073f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-03-24T01:24:29Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T01:24:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/MVK8ivRKQbw/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_140.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_140.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=3&amp;amp;day=24&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;13 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004957" title=""&gt;Expert Financial Advice Neurobiologically 'Offloads' Financial Decision-Making under Risk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Financial advice from experts is commonly sought during times of uncertainty. While the field of neuroeconomics has made considerable progress in understanding the neurobiological basis of risky decision-making, the neural mechanisms through which external information, such as advice, is integrated during decision-making are poorly understood. In the current experiment, we investigated the neurobiological basis of the influence of expert advice on financial decisions under risk. While undergoing fMRI scanning, participants made a series of financial choices between a certain payment and a lottery. Choices were made in two conditions: 1) advice from a financial expert about which choice to make was displayed (MES condition); and 2) no advice was displayed (NOM condition). Behavioral results showed a significant effect of expert advice. Specifically, probability weighting functions changed in the direction of the expert's advice. This was paralleled by neural activation patterns. Brain activations showing significant correlations with valuation (parametric modulation by value of lottery/sure win) were obtained in the absence of the expert's advice (NOM) in intraparietal sulcus, posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus, precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Notably, no significant correlations with value were obtained in the presence of advice (MES). These findings were corroborated by region of interest analyses. Neural equivalents of probability weighting functions showed significant flattening in the MES compared to the NOM condition in regions associated with probability weighting, including anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC, thalamus, medial occipital gyrus and anterior insula. Finally, during the MES condition, significant activations in temporoparietal junction and medial PFC were obtained. These results support the hypothesis that one effect of expert advice is to "offload" the calculation of value of decision options from the individual's brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004956" title=""&gt;Detecting Linkage between a Trait and a Marker in a Random Mating Population without Pedigree Record&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern linkage-based approaches employing extended pedigrees are becoming powerful tools for localizing complex quantitative trait loci. For these linkage mapping methods, it is necessary to reconstruct extended pedigrees which include living individuals, using extensive pedigree records. Unfortunately, such records are not always easy to obtain and application of the linkage-based approaches has been restricted. Within a finite population under random mating, latent inbreeding rather than non-random inbreeding by consanguineous marriages is expected to occur and is attributable to coalescence in a finite population. Interestingly, it has been revealed that significant random inbreeding exists even in general human populations. Random inbreeding should be used to detect the hidden coancestry between individuals for a particular chromosomal position and it could also have application in linkage mapping methods. Here we present a novel method, named finite population based linkage mapping (FPL) method, to detect linkage between a quantitative trait and a marker via random inbreeding in a finite population without pedigree records. We show how to estimate coancestry for a chromosomal position between individuals by using multipoint Bayesian estimation. Subsequently, we describe the FPL method for detecting linkage via interval mapping method using a nonparametric test. We show that the FPL method does work via simulated data. For a random sample from a finite population, the FPL method is more powerful than a standard pedigree-based linkage mapping method with using genotypes of all parents of the sample. In addition, the FPL method was demonstrated by actual microsatellite genotype data of 750 Japanese individuals that are unrelated according to pedigree records to map a known Psoriasis susceptible locus. For samples without pedigree records, it was suggested that the FPL method require limited number of individuals, therefore would be better than other methods using thousands of individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_140.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/MVK8ivRKQbw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237863951788"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2620">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de37306014f09843</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="statutory rape"/><category term="teenagers"/><category term="Wisconsin"/><title type="html">Teens, statutory rape, and double standards</title><published>2009-03-24T03:04:57Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T03:04:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/teens-statutory-rape-and-double-standards/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sheboygan, Wis., a 17-year-old boy was arrested and charged with felony sexual assault for having consensual sex with his 14-year-old girlfriend.

Albright (1891–1971) and the Albright School&lt;/a&gt;, the historicity of both the Patriarchs and Moses are now understood as pure religious myth.) &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result of this edited legacy, the Israelite priests severed the Temple and whose control was nothing short of divine dynasty (After the reform of Josiah ended local shrines that posed competition for the Jerusalem Temple 2 Kings 22 - 23).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here the grain, meat and drink offerings where served to the national god &lt;em&gt;Yahweh &lt;/em&gt;only by this limited and tightly controlled priesthood. While whole offering sacrifices are discussed in the Hebrew text, the late and general procedure for offering a sacrifice, was (as in the case of meat) by taking only the best unblemished animals (“without blemish” is the requirement for sacrifice that runs throughout the entire book of Leviticus or a text constituting a major document of the Priestly school). Moreover, slaughtering it in the proper kosher method by bleeding it and then burning the fat, guts and bones to Yahweh while keeping the eatable portions for the priests themselves. What was not eaten by the priests was sold to the general Israelite population living in Jerusalem or the neighboring towns for money to maintain the Temple and spending money for these priests to support their families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Priestly Code is a complex religious document that demands sacrifice for sin offerings from everything from childbirth to a national Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) of an animal sacrifice by the High Priest to a yearly massive slaughter house event require of all Israelites called Passover. It is at such time as Passover that the strong stench of animal urine, dung and blood along with the bellowing cries of animals waiting for slaughter could be totally over powering when the streets around the Temple ran red with animal blood diluted with both urine and fecal matter. This, to such over lords as the Greeks (Seleucids such as Antiochus IV) and the Romans, Jewish sacrifice was totally repulsive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should this lunar event fall further into the heat of spring, the stench was multiplied along with pollution and disease. (We might note here that, just like a slaughtered Temple animal, the dying Jesus’ blood, as well as that of the other two criminals crucified on either side of him would have also been mixed with his own urine and fecal matter along with vomit which would most likely would have covered his chest due to a slow suffocating death.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{In this respect, the Catholic crucifix (which depicts a loin cloth over the Jesus‘ private parts) is nothing but a pious depiction of the horrible reality of Roman crucifixion created not to offend its use in public churches above the altar. (The fact that medieval religious art depicts only Jesus nailed to the cross while the other two criminals are tied to their crosses is simply to help the pious religious mind think that ONLY Jesus alone shed his blood and clearly to teach a major Christian dogma in the doctrine of atonement and salvation.)}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the Temple rededicated under the Hasmonaeans and the Jews now under Roman control, Judea was now given to Herod the Great to rule. To keep things civil, Herod's religious choices made sure the Temple affairs were run by secular priests or, what the New Testament calls Sadducees. (Josephus Antiques XV, XVI, XVII 1-8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the average religious Jew, secular life and religious law were meshed into one. Other than satisfying the tax burden of Rome, the life of a pious Jew as to satisfy the Torah requirements of their national religious life and heritage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no separation between religion and state, Temple corruption was rampart as noted by both Josephus and the Gospels. In short, what we find in the selling of animals in the Temple was none other than one of the first examples of a Capitalistic economy where profit is a motivating factor. Or better put, why travel to Jerusalem with an animal which one must feed and water on the journey and which may get blemished on the way; when one could simply take advantage of the “Buy Here; Sacrifice Here” convenient store Temple offerings. After all, money was a lot easier to carry up to Jerusalem for Passover than an animal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the secular Sadducees control the Temple and the selling of sacrificial animals near the altar; for a price, one was guaranteed an animal without blemish would be guaranteed pass the test of the priest and leave everyone happy (whether it was in fact spotless could be certainly over looked for a good selling price).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that Jesus is depicted in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 21: 12 - 14; Mark 11: 15 -18; Luke 19: 45 - 47) as objecting to the buying and selling in the Temple places his theology more in line with the Pharisees who were highly conservative in their theology, but who lack any control over the Temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mixture of religion, state and Capitalism ended abruptly in 70 CE when the Romans burnt the last Temple ending both the secular sect of the Sadducees and over 2,000 years of sacrificial of offerings to Yahweh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6140610739723085848?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/name-a-piece-of-the-space-station/"&gt;As you may recall&lt;/a&gt;, NASA opened up a contest to name Node 3, a connecting module to be put on the International Space Station next February. The name &amp;quot;Serenity&amp;quot; (awesome!) was doing very well, and then &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/08/30/stephen-colbert-on-notice/"&gt;my arch-enemy&lt;/a&gt; Stephen Colbert started asking his Nation to send in votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29841715/"&gt;there were 230,000 votes for &amp;quot;Colbert&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, 40,000 more than for &amp;quot;Serenity&amp;quot;. But this is not over, because NASA was smart in the original contest. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/rules.html"&gt;Contest Rule #4&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA will take into consideration the results of the voting. However, the results are not binding on NASA and NASA reserves the right to ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency, its needs, and other considerations. Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names. NASA’s decision shall be deemed final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll watch Colbert tonight, and I’m sure he’ll claim victory. But that clause means NASA doesn’t have to use the winning entry! Of course, it would be smart in a PR way for NASA to name it &amp;quot;Colbert&amp;quot; — and even if they don’t, I just bet the astronauts will, informally — but we’ll see. I’m still holding out for the right choice. After all, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0579533/quotes"&gt;like the man said&lt;/a&gt;, you treat her proper, she’ll be with you for the rest of your life. &lt;/p&gt;

Basically a group of morons spouted off and ragged on the Canadian military for potentially taking time off at the end of the current mission.  Calls and emails abounded and half-assed apologies were issued - all worthless.  Especially noteworthy, however, was what one panel member, Bill Schulz, said on his Twitter account:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To all canadians that keep emailing me: R u really from the land of SCTV and jim carrey? Lighten the fuck up."&lt;/blockquote&gt;All misspellings and text-slang are his, obviously.  Those extra four letters and three capitals take time to include and he's clearly got a lot of dicks to suck.  Time is money, bitches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, this is why people hate you, Bill.  Not just you, by the way, I'm referring to the &lt;i&gt;grand&lt;/i&gt; "you"...as in &lt;i&gt;all of you&lt;/i&gt;...as in Americans.  You say stupid, ignorant, insulting, fucking brain-dead bullshit, then get called on it - but then you can't even muster the goddamn humility to say you're sorry in any meaningful way.  You get smarmy and fuckish about it, making everyone go from hating you to wanting you to die in a car fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and yes, "jim carrey" (sic) is from Canada (we capitalize proper nouns up here, not that you'd know that or what a proper noun is), but we knew that his lame dick and fart jokes, retreaded movie ideas, and penchant for woo-woo bullshit would make him fit right in down there with you folks.  Enjoy him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and we're Canadians, not canadians.  No wonder your economy collapsed if you can't even string a fucking sentence together.

&lt;em&gt;In the wake of President Obama's remarks about the Special Olympics last Thursday on The Tonight Show, this post takes another closer look at the Special Olympics. A &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_olympics_for_who_i"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Sunday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE0yAEvVsUo"&gt;clip of the President making the comment&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE0yAEvVsUo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; it can be noted that what Obama says about his bowling score is "This is just like Special Olympics," with the meaning that the support he's getting for his bowling, regardless of his score, is just like the support Special Olympics audiences give their athletes---namely, everyone is cheered unconditionally. Right after this, Jay Leno says, "Oh no, that's very good. That's very good, Mr. President" and applauds Obama's bowling score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping this in mind, and the &lt;a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/otherviews/1490262,CST-EDT-open23a.article"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; directed to the President in the wake of his remark, consider again what Canadian journalist Lauren McKeon writes in &lt;a href="http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2008/05/letmeplay.php"&gt;This Magazine&lt;/a&gt; (May-June 2008), &lt;a href="http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2008/05/letmeplay.php"&gt;Why won't you let me play?: Is the Special Olympics discriminating against the kids it's supposed to help?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of the Special Olympics they picture cheery children with Down syndrome or autism, perhaps somewhat befuddled by the life around them. With marketing material full of inspiring images of young athletes waving victory Vs, hugging in camaraderie and “Winning at Life,” SOC promotes a specific image of its mission and its athletes. But like so many marketing campaigns, the pictures used to make the sell don’t tell the whole story. It is true that SOC is inspiring, enabling and, well, special, but it is not the organization so many visualize: one that is there for everybody. Contrary to popular perception, the reality is that SOC’s highest-ranked athletes—those who go on to provincials, nationals and worlds—are often adults. Perhaps more troubling, however, is that the hierarchy of competition tends to favour the more able athletes. These are the athletes who, while they may not appear as frequently in promotional materials, receive a disproportionate amount of the revenue the pitches generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKeon is throughout careful to note that chapters of the Special Olympics vary in how they organize their activities. Fitness and the promotion of lifelong health through athletics and physical activity is the main goal of many families who seek out the Special Olympics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Special Olympics doesn’t consistently reward lower-functioning athletes, but it does use them to promote the games to volunteers, would-be athletes and funders. A few years ago, one Special Olympics club member gave the Ontario office a picture of two young girls with Down syndrome gleefully smiling. It’s now plastered on banners, awards and other promotional material. She wonders how much reward those two girls, and others like them, are receiving from all that promotion. “People donate thinking it’s going to stay in the community, but once they write that cheque, it’s gone,” says Theresa Grabowski, co-founder of Challenge League Sports. “I think the intent of it all is good—and nothing runs perfect—but it’s not as evenly distributed as they’d like you to believe it is.” She adds, “But, I’ve got to say, on the other hand, if I were fundraising and marketing for these people, that’s the way to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that a more equitable distribution of donations would go a long way toward mitigating the ill effects of the emphasis on competition and winning. Special Olympics Canada has its own operating budget, mainly devoted to the higher levels of competition and the athletes competing in those games. In 2006—the most recent return filed to the Canada Revenue Agency—its revenue was $4.8 million. About $1.3 million of that came from fundraising, both corporate and event based, just under $30,000 from tax-receipted gifts—donations—and about $950,000 from the Canadian government. There is about $2.1 million worth of revenue slotted under the “other” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grabowski does wonder sometimes why those selling Special Olympics cannot receive a greater chunk of the benefits. She founded Challenge League Sports in 1994 with her husband because at the time her local region had no Special Olympics programs for her eight-year-old son. “When we took him to [Special Olympics] swimming they wouldn’t take him because he couldn’t swim two lengths of the pool. If you can’t swim two lengths you’re not ready for training, for competition. It was, ‘Go learn to swim, because we’re not teaching you how to swim,’” she recalls. But, she is careful to add, programs and policies can vary from club to club. “If you go to another town they might have the volunteers and the space and the time. They might teach you how to swim, or develop your swimming so that you can become competitive and swim in a race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, though, her only choices were to enroll him in a generic club, which she tried to do with baseball—“The parents were not too understanding of why he thought he could go to bat twice, or why he didn’t want to stop at first base, or why he was sliding at home—all kinds of whys”—or start her own club, which she also did. In the beginning, it was just a group of people she knew getting together to play baseball, but after an ad in the local paper, Challenge League was officially formed. For the first five years, the organization wasn’t even affiliated with Special Olympics and made a go of it on its own, aligning itself with the community-level Oshawa Minor Baseball Association for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid to say, but our experience to have Charlie---who is (and I know I am his mother, but this is a fact, not only a boast) a superior swimmer---join our local Special Olympics chapter was met with a puzzling disinterest. We explained that Charlie can swing lap after lap; we were also told that we ought only to come back "when he can do the strokes." We've often seen the Special Olympics team practicing when we go to the YMCA to swim on the weekends and I've noted that there are many more athletes than staff and volunteers to pair with them. Charlie would &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_not_swimming_alone"&gt;need a 1:1 aide&lt;/a&gt; so, for this reason alone, our local Special Olympics is not for him, yet; maybe in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is just what happened one afternoon when we made one inquiry to one Special Olympics coach. We've since just continued to encourage Charlie to swim for fitness and fun: After all, the point of him swimming is not so he can win medals and accolades, but so that he's doing something for his health and well-being, something that he enjoys, that soothes and calms and delights him, and that we can do together as a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKeon writes that Carol has played goalie for the Durham Dragons, a hockey team for players with disabilities, since 2000. The team is not associated with Special Olympics. In 2007, Carol had her "shining moment" at the big league tournament in Arlington, Virginia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stoned the opposing team’s star player, who’d already scored five goals, when he was sure he would make it six with a penalty shot. Two weeks later, at the year-end banquet, the head coach told the story of “the best save of the tournament.” Carol received a standing ovation from the entire league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what it's all about, and Charlie biking away with Jim bringing up the rear: That's what it's all about, those moments that are invisible trophies of achievement. These are truly special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these trophies don't get dusty.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237856808322"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/made-my-first-risotto-and-it-t/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3fc9ecc14af9c57c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">made my first risotto and it t…</title><published>2009-03-24T01:01:32Z</published><updated>2009-03-24T01:01:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/made-my-first-risotto-and-it-t/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;made my first risotto and it turned out pretty damn good: onion, arboreo rice, vermouth, chicken stock, coconut milk !shortrecipes&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237855132775"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/pipe_smoking_tango_listening_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ed88d3b2ec96e6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Art"/><title type="html">Pipe Smoking, Tango Listening Auteur</title><published>2009-03-23T22:03:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T22:03:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/-inJybIhrWI/pipe_smoking_tango_listening_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/pipe_smoking_tango_listening_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/hzzgzRzBxU0%26hl%3Dsv%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is it not a status symbol of sorts to have a noteworthy collection of &lt;a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt; magazines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading National Geographic since I was a young child. It fills me with utter delight to hold a fresh copy within my hands.  As I venture into the magazine, I know that I will read and learn about the world in positive exciting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a new plant, or the study of a newfound creature, warrants utmost caution, care, and environmental respect. Scientists go through great lengths to efficiently recreate plant and animal environments when necessary. It would be an abomination to encroach upon, change, or redirect the fine ecosystem of a unique organism. It is highly likely that the press and media surrounding any new discovery is carefully thought out and sincere in its depiction. Mistakes may be pointed out and corrected, but generally, there is mentionable collaboration amongst scientists and other involved peoples. Oftentimes, the species or organism itself is allowed to do the teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there were to be an Autism Geographic magazine? I can only imagine the excitement of collecting such a periodical. Inside, there would be autistic people worldwide, wearing all sorts of facial expressions, and doing all sorts of different things. I would run my fingers over the high gloss pages and spend a lot of time rereading especially enticing articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine that there would be many people who would want to crush, alienate, or annihilate a new plant or animal species—unless it proved to be fatal to our survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are many wells from which prejudice is drawn from. Both hatred and misunderstanding stem from fear and miscommunication. It was not so long ago when mass consciousness projected thoughts that women, people of color, foreigners, and children, for example, were not only of lesser status, but also of unsound mind. Disability has been accommodated to some point, but there has not been enough of a shift in public perception regarding those who are different. Only in recent times, has the voice of the autistic come to be heard. Despite the best of intentions from those who care, wrongdoing and atrocity continue to prevail while feeding from ignorance and widespread lack of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in an indispensable world that dispenses. We are, at times, divided and broken, yet there is always power amongst like-minded individuals. There need only be one catalyst to ignite magnificent change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autistic children grow to be autistic adults. It is imperative that resources be directed toward providing and sustaining appropriate and effective education, integration, acceptance, opportunity, and legal protection. Housing and quality healthcare are also of utmost importance.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voices, both autistic and non-autistic, are rising above the suffocating binds of invisibility, oppression, and misrepresentation. Now is the time to strike.

Here is my lengthy response in its entirety and unedited: &lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't bother with them much. They're in a world of their own. One simply cannot presuppose the truths of disputable historical events prior to investigating whether or not those events actually took place and keep a straight face.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1379429843041253570?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to extend the virtual welcome mat (made of electrons only) to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;The Intersection&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;del&gt;the Hive Overmind’s&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine’s newest blog! Actually, it’s not new: written by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum, it’s actually been around a few years, but it’s new to DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name refers to the intersection between science and politics, and they both have a lot to say about that. Most of their stuff is a lot more measured and stated more politely than mine — though I would never be &lt;em&gt;rude&lt;/em&gt;, heaven forbid — but I think you’ll find a lot of what they say thought-provoking to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never met Sheril (that’ll happen eventually, no doubt at the annual cotillion DM hosts on its floating sky platform high above the forests of Brobdignang), but I’ve hung out with Chris once or twice in the past; you’ll see his name peppered throughout my blog. He wrote &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Storm World&lt;/em&gt;, two books I highly recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So fire up your feed reader and drop them in. I guarantee you’ll find their blog an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237844249610"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/circumstances_under_which_it_i.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d471ba13cbe9133</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communication"/><title type="html">Circumstances under which it is OK for scientists to pull numbers out of thin air?</title><published>2009-03-23T18:51:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T18:51:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/fa0dCitm6Og/circumstances_under_which_it_i.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/circumstances_under_which_it_i.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some commenters on my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/a_habit_that_never_ceases_to_a.php"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; seem to be of the view that it is perfectly fine for scientists to pull numbers out of thin air to bolster their claims, at least under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

People are out of jobs like crazy.

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’ve lost your job. With the competition so steep for jobs, would you be willing to take anything? Could you take a job promoting Sylvia Browne or Jenny McCarthy’s vaccine awareness knowing that you may not see another job opportunity for months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/butterfly-timelapse-videos/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/tkiU9uFwqmw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly interesting to see these color changes as the butterflies develop–and then they suddenly turn a milky color. What’s happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for shedding a skin, an insect secretes &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The-arthropods-moulting-3.gif"&gt;moulting fluid&lt;/a&gt;.  This liquid separates the old skin from the new one underneath it–and eventually partially dissolves the cuticle.  This changes the color and opacity of the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of other nifty time-lapses at that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=2E6F66D887AE1EA7"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;–These &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3jbzq-_7bU"&gt;swallowtails&lt;/a&gt; are fascinating to watch as they wriggle out of their larval skins like an old sock, and a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPVEug_uFZk"&gt;silkmoth spins a cocoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For amazing shiny beauty, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; watch this&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyWJlpIchkE"&gt; lifecycle of purple hairstreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, were you trying to get work done? Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

In any case, the 108th Meeting of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; is fast approaching. In fact, it's a mere two and a half days away! This time around, it will land in the very capable hands of &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/"&gt;Podblack Cat&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, March 26. As always, the guidelines for submissions can be found &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the host-specific contact information for this week can be found &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1301"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Don't let a feline down; send her your best stuff by Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as always, hosts are needed. I'd very much like to fill out the summer schedule within the next month or two, so that I can just chill and go on vacation. (I wish!) In any case, if you have a blog and think you have what it takes to pilot one of these puppies in for a successful landing, take a gander at the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;guidelines for hosts&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/contact.php"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt;. I'll peruse your blog to make sure you aren't Casey Luskin or Dean Ornish in disguise trying to infiltrate and then I'll plug you into the schedule.&lt;br&gt;

And it really is one I can’t share just now. I promised someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may speculate all you want in the comments, and I won’t confirm or deny anything until the time is right, and I can reveal all. It’s not Earth-shattering or anything, but if things work out the right way, it’ll be a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, for reasons I can’t explain just yet, I need some help. It’s totally self-serving, and I make neither apologies nor excuses for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I’d like for you, me droogs, to spread the word about my blog. I don’t want anything artificial, like people clicking my posts lots of times just to rack up traffic — that won’t help, and may hurt, so seriously, please don’t. I want this to be at least somewhat organic, though with a kick start. If you like something I’ve written, tell a friend. Email someone with a link to a post here that you liked. You can help promote it via social networks like Digg, Reddit, and StumbleUpon (use the buttons at the top of each post; you may need to register with those sites which is free and actually worth your time, since there’s lots more great content waiting for you there). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also do a lot of chit-chatting and such on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, so you can follow me there (I link to a lot of friends’ stuff you might otherwise miss, too). I’m also on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=33206428"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this is self-serving, but the end result should be fun. And if it pans out — well truly, even if it doesn’t, but I hope it does — I’ll reveal everything, in probably more detail than you’ll want. That’s a promise to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237840636542"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/i-so-want-this-mirror-fabulous-marquetry-from-hudson-river-inlay.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e5b009ac7ad9f34b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="House"/><title type="html">I So Want This Mirror (Fabulous Marquetry from Hudson River Inlay)</title><published>2009-03-23T01:04:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T01:04:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/i-so-want-this-mirror-fabulous-marquetry-from-hudson-river-inlay.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just garden stuff at the &lt;a href="http://www.gardenshow.com/sf/index/index.cfm"&gt;San Francisco Garden Show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hudsonriverinlay.com/"&gt;Hudson River Inlay &lt;/a&gt;had a booth -- I covet the &lt;a href="http://com/pages/mirrors/lgmirrors/1001/1001be.htm"&gt;Floral Garland Mirror&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our mission is to bring the timeless beauty and spiritual richness of tropical South-East Asia to our customers&amp;#39; gardens and homes by providing a collection of the region&amp;#39;s finest artistry and craftsmanship.

&lt;p&gt;
Gardensia owner Sekti Artanegara, hopes to bring the essence of his Indonesian homeland to gardens and homes in the US. With the help of college-friend Handri, Sekti and his wife, Lisa C. Ho, fill their 6,000 foot Berkeley, California showroom with fine ornamental carvings, art stone statues, fountains, old teak architectural elements and furniture from workshops and villages in Java, Bali and other tropical getaways.

 I was remiss in not mentioning it earlier.  Last night was a sung Requiem Eucharist  for Jacques Littlefield at his home church, &lt;a href="http://www.ccpvw.org/?PageID=1499"&gt;Christ Church Episcopal&lt;/a&gt;, where he was for many years a member of the choir.  The service was beautifully sung, and very moving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photo above was taken May 16, 2008, at &lt;a href="http://www.rrservices.co.uk/index2.html"&gt;Mike Stallwood&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.rrservices.co.uk/"&gt;RR Motor Services&lt;/a&gt; in Kent, England, and was a celebration of the Churchill Toad&amp;#39;s completion.  The Toad is now in the Littlefield Collection at the &lt;a href="http://www.milvehtechfound.com/"&gt;Military Vehicle Technology Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.   The photo is from &lt;a href="http://www.milweb.net/features/toad.php"&gt;this article at MilWeb &lt;/a&gt;-- photographer either Samuel Penhallow or &lt;a href="http://www.militaryvehiclephotos.com/index.htm"&gt;John Blackman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things Jumper Girl has said about what she&amp;#39;s learned in the last 10 weeks, speaking of the large turn-out for her father&amp;#39;s memorial service: &amp;quot;You probably have no idea about the number of people who are fond of you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other was, &amp;quot;When in doubt, wear plaid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237840636540"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/teacher-education-beliefbased-or-sciencebased.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23030bcd968566f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education: Independent And Private Schools"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><category term="Educational Therapy"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">Teacher Education: Belief-Based or Science-Based?</title><published>2009-03-21T15:31:24Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T15:31:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/teacher-education-beliefbased-or-sciencebased.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is from an interview between &lt;a href="http://www.childrenofthecode.org/boulton.htm"&gt;David Boulton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://web.mac.com/kstanovich/iWeb/Site/Home.html"&gt;Keith Stanovich&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.childrenofthecode.org"&gt;Children of the Code&lt;/a&gt;. The whole interview is called &lt;a href="http://www.childrenofthecode.org/interviews/stanovich.htm"&gt;Cognitive Science: The Conceptual Components of Reading &amp;amp; What Reading Does for the Mind&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
David Boulton: In particular, what I'm referring to is the way that we educate teachers. We don't take them into a first-person, grounded understanding of this challenge from which to become scientist-learners in their own right, in their practice of it, and they end up subscribing to belief mechanisms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Keith Stanovich: Yes.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
David Boulton: And in that sense, it's like competing religions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Keith Stanovich: Yes, very much so. They respond to the charismatic people they had in teacher education school and they're not given what I would call discipline-based knowledge. Actually it's not just reading I have an interest in, my other research area is critical thinking. Similar things go on there. You have teachers picking up knowledge from in-service gurus and teaching reading without a knowledge of phonology or orthography or the history of linguistic change, which I see is one of your interests, and what I would call information processing, cognitive psychology, for that matter, relevant issues and cognitive development. This is what I call the discipline-based knowledge that surrounds reading. Very little of it penetrates into reading education.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The point I make is that this is an unfortunately replicable phenomena. It happens in the area of critical thinking as well. Schools have programs they get, again, from commercial packages, in-service gurus, with no grounding in discipline-based knowledge in thinking and reasoning; and I mean discipline-based knowledge in philosophy, decision science, decision theory, cognitive science - where principles of rational thought are being studied empirically and theoretically by philosophers. None of this penetrates education. So, I think it's a recurring problem.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
David Boulton: And the biggest danger that I see as I bump into what you're talking about is that teachers are trained out of being learners. There’s such a difference between belief based on somebody else's knowledge...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Keith Stanovich: Right.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
David Boulton: And actually having an appetite to understand something for yourself, striving into your own learning, and then having access to the kind of resources that will support your learning and keeping it going right through your practice in school with kids.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Dr. Keith Stanovich: Well said. Every component of what you've listed is missing from the educational culture. I couldn't agree more.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It isn&amp;#39;t that the issue is unimportant, just more pressing things to talk about.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a panel at SXSWi: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/panels?action=show&amp;amp;id=IAP0901035"&gt;That&amp;#39;s Not My Name: Beating Down Misogyny Online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This panel explores the complex and violent ways that women are treated online, specifically feminists when they speak publicly about politics. Presenting some of the lead feminist voices on the internet we will discuss and share our war stories while offering tips for how to survive the anti-feminist internet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://liz-henry.blogspot.com/2009/03/sxswi-fighting-online-misogyny-panel.html"&gt;Liz Henry liveblogged the panel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still think that what Dorothea Salo said in 2007 is strong:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/archives/2007/03/30/what-some-folks-can-do-if-they-choose/"&gt;But the cycle can be broken.&lt;/a&gt; It just has to be broken by men.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is what you do, if you’re a man wanting to help. You say, “Um, was that supposed to be funny? Because, not laughing here.” You say, “Hey, could we not use that phrase? I don’t like it.” You say to the main perpetrators, in IRC whispers or private email or whatever, “Hey, would you mind toning down the jokes? That kind of talk really bothers me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is to express that the demeaning of women bothers &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, you &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spring Creek closes its doors
Posted: Wednesday, Jan 14, 2009 - 09:55:42 am MST
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;

Valley Press
Spring Creek Lodge closed its doors for the last time Friday Jan. 9, leaving everyone who had been employed there unemployed and the students at the lodge without a place to go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Representatives for Spring Creek Lodge could not be reached for comment by the Valley Press before press time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lodge first opened its doors about 30 years ago by Nancy and Steve Cawdrey. The lodge was opened as a place to address drug, alcohol and behavioral issues of young people from across the county.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lodge once had over 500 students enrolled, but during the past several years enrollment dropped down to less than 50.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thompson Falls Superintendent Jerry Pauli said that while he had no ties to the lodge, the Thompson Falls school system had been impacted by it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“As their enrollment numbers went down, people who worked there were unemployed, which caused kids to leave our schools because their parents needed to relocate,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At one point Spring Creek Lodge was the largest employer in Sanders County as it employed about 200 individuals in various positions throughout the lodge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pauli said that the Thompson Falls School Board will be holding a special meeting Tuesday Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. to discuss the expansion of their own Alternative Learning Center at Thompson Falls High School.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He said the Alternative Learning Center has been around for years and has had anywhere from 30-43 kids involved either part or full-time in the program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“What we’re doing is looking to expand that program to pick up some of the kids who were in Spring Creek,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pauli said there will likely be some students from Spring Creek that will be picked up by families in the Thompson Falls area and expanding the Alternative Learning Center would be a great way to help accommodate those students.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“At the meeting we’ll be addressing and hopefully making a decision on whether or not we should expand our services and this program to include these students,” he said. 
&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know how common it is for a lawyer to be selected for jury duty, but I’d guess it must be pretty rare. I know that as an expert witness I’ve never made it past the voir dire stage in the many times I’ve been summoned for jury duty. I’ve always been “struck” by the lawyers when they learn that I’ve been an expert witness in scores of trials. They don’t seem to want to let anyone who has professional experience analyzing evidence be a trier of the fact in their cases. And that may be the right way to do it, for all I know. In this case, however, the opposing lawyers actually picked another lawyer to be a juror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal injury case was Barber (a customer) v. Shoprite (a grocery store chain), in which Joyce Barber slipped on the floor and was severely injured.  During the usual voir dire of potential jurors, the opposing lawyers decided to include attorney and state senator Robert Martin as one of the six jurors to decide the case. At the end of the trial, this jury awarded the plaintiff $876,000 in damages resulting from her fall in a Shoprite store. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some months later, the defendant appealed this judgment on several grounds, one of which was that lawyer/juror Martin had subsequently published an article in a law journal describing his apparently unusual, enlightening, insider’s-experience as a juror. The three-judge appellate panel dismissed most of the defendant’s claims, but came down hard on lawyer/juror Martin, who was also the jury foreman. Not uncommonly, his fellow jurors were confused by some of the instructions the judge gave them before they retired to deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his law journal article, Martin described the jury instructions as an hour long “mini-course in tort law” and added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#993300"&gt;For example, I was asked to clarify what the judge meant by&lt;br&gt;
“proximate cause” and its significance in proving a negligence&lt;br&gt;
claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after the decision, the appellate court remanded the matter for a hearing in which the jurors, including Martin, were questioned. Here Martin openly reiterated what he said in his law journal article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#993300"&gt;We were going through [the] instructions, and I believe the words, “proximate cause”        were actually the language, and acouple—at least one juror wanted to have a little              more clarification as to what “proximate cause” was. And so we, you know, talked            about that…I am pretty familiar with the generalprinciples of tort law, and I heard              [the judge] give [his]instructions to us, and I could easily remember the instructions          that [he] gave us. And if there was a question or two, I could sort of regurgitate it              better than most because I was very familiar with the kind of language and the                  terminology and the way in which it’s applied in doing a personal injury case…I did          not, you know, present my own legal theory on what I think tort law should be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d guess that most of us, perhaps lawyers included, don’t have a very good idea of what “proximate cause” means.  The late highly respected legal analyst, David Mellinkoff, called this term of art “concise gibberish” (&lt;em&gt;The Language of the Law,&lt;/em&gt; ((1963, p. 401).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Garner’s &lt;em&gt;Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage&lt;/em&gt; (1995, p. 711) says proximate cause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt; …is a term of art having little to do with physical causation, emphasizing instead             the continuity of the sequence that produces an event. The meaning is elusive: a               cause to which the law will take notice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m confused about legal terminology, I usually go to Peter Tiersma’s book, &lt;em&gt;Legal Language&lt;/em&gt; (Chicago,1999), which has a marvelous chapter called “What Makes Legal Language Difficult to Understand?” Tiersma sees legal language from an enlightened position because he’s a law professor who also holds a PhD in linguistics. First on his list of difficult features is technical vocabulary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt; Some of the best evidence that people have trouble with legal terminology comes from the fact that jurors, after they have received their instructions, all too often turn to dictionaries for enlightenment. Jurors do this even though the rules prohibit them from consulting any outside source (which includes dictionaries). A survey of American decisional law found many cases in which jurors have been accused of misconduct for looking up words, including &lt;i&gt;assault&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;battery&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;culpable&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;custody&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;entrapment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;inference&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;insanity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;legal cause&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;malice&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;malpractice&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;motive&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;murder&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;negligent&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;possession&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;premeditate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;preponderance&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;proximate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;prudent&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rape&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;reasonable&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;undue&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;utter&lt;/i&gt; (as in &lt;i&gt;utter a forged check&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;wanton&lt;/i&gt;. (p. 203)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, “proximate” and “cause” are on Tiersma’s list. Remember, the Barber jurors only wanted to know what the judge meant by “proximate cause.” Yes, the jury could have given the bailiff a note to the judge requesting a definition. But based on what Mellinkoff, Garner, and Tiersma have to say about the expression, the chances of getting a helpful answer seem pretty slim.  We can only guess what Martin might have told his fellow jurors about “proximate cause,” but it can’t have been any more helpful than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the three-judge panel’s decision in Barber v. Shoprite.  The question was whether irregular influences on the jury could have a tendency to influence the jury in arriving at a verdict in a manner inconsistent with the legal proofs and the court’s charge. The panel wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt; Tendency to influence the verdict — not probability or likelihood – is the standard for determining whether a new trial should be granted…It is not the role of the foreperson to explain legal concepts to the other jurors…our review of the entire record in this case convinces us that Martin’s explanations to the jury had a &amp;quot;tendency&amp;quot;  to influence the verdict…That &amp;quot;tendency,&amp;quot; coupled with the cumulative trial errors, deprived defendant of a fair trial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court then remanded the matter for a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; jurors supposed to interpret judges’ confusing and complex jury instructions? The Barber jury got an unexpected bonus by having an attorney help them figure some of it out.  It seems unfortunate, if not unproductive, that the standards of law apparently prohibit juries from learning about legal concepts that are crucial to the trial but unknown to them.  It must have been difficult for Martin to tell them something like, “It’s concise gibberish and an elusive term of art.” No matter. Even if Martin had been able to give his fellow jury members a precise, non-elusive, non-gibberish explanation, he apparently deprived the defendant of a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a meaningful lesson here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237838353161"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6087">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b671885640b64b9f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="price theory"/><title type="html">Ladies' Day at the Beach</title><published>2009-03-23T19:43:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T19:43:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/LxJX51GSySI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/ladies-day-at-the-beach/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">he Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas boasts the &lt;a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/thingstodo/mooreabeachclub.aspx"&gt;Moorea Club&lt;/a&gt;, which it advertises as offering a European-style beach, with entry limited to ages 21 and over.

Representative Hamilton's exhaustive request included demands for all e-mails and correspondence relating to the speech; a list of all money paid to Dawkins and the entities, public or private, responsible for this funding; and the total cost to the university, including, among other things, security fees, advertising, and even "faculty time spent promoting this event."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rick Farmer, the director of committee staff for the Oklahoma House of Representatives, also wrote the University on March 12, requesting confirmation that Dawkins had indeed waived all compensation for the speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually too bad that Dawkins waived his fee — he was well within his rights to ask for it, and the university had the right to invest in bringing interesting ideas to campus. The issue is not whether speakers should be paid, it&amp;#39;s whether these witch-hunters are overstepping &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; bounds. Don't like an idea that's being expressed at a university? Call out the hounds and make 'em sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

Nicholson had been head of sustainability at Grainger plc, a residential property investment company, but claims his attempts at implementing environmental and corporate social responsibility policies were blocked by fellow executives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This case is noteworthy because it reveals several things - that someone could be fired for doing their job too enthusiastically, that Grainger plc possesses an asinine attitude toward their carbon footprint (on one occasion flying a member of staff to Ireland to return the CEO's Blackberry), - but most striking is the ruling that a 'philosophical belief in climate change' was on par with religious belief such Christianity or Islam. This may be a boost for environmentalism, but it comes at the expense of science.&lt;br&gt;

I knew this would mean we’d see transits of the moons: from our view, the moons seem to pass directly over the face of Saturn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5462/Moon_Shadow_in_Motion"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/cassini_epimetheus_anim.gif" alt="Cassini animation of the moon Epimetheus’s shadow on the rings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; think of is this also means the moons will cast shadows on the rings themselves! This is starting to happen now, and Cassini, our robot-on-the-spot, is now sending back spectacular pictures (like it ever sends back any other kind, duh) of these events! The animation you see here (click to embiggen) shows the tiny moon Epimetheus — only 113 km (70 miles) across — casting its own shadow on the rings. While it was still a million kilometers from the tiny world, Cassini took a series of images that the ground team strung together &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5462/Moon_Shadow_in_Motion"&gt;into this beautiful and somewhat eerie animation&lt;/a&gt;. The shadow moves across the rings because Epimetheus’s orbit isn’t precisely aligned with the rings, it’s tilted by less than a degree, but that’s enough to send its stretched-out shadow drifting across the rings like a ghost as the moon bobs above the ring plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="middle"&gt;If you look at this still frame from the animation, you can see incredible detail in the rings, and even that the shadow is not quite symmetric; probably a reflection (so to speak) of &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/search.php?search=epimetheus&amp;amp;page_0_0=1&amp;amp;page_2_0=1&amp;amp;page_2_1=1&amp;amp;page_3_0=1&amp;amp;page_3_1=1&amp;amp;page_3_2=1&amp;amp;page_3_3=1&amp;amp;page_4_0=1&amp;amp;page_5_0=1&amp;amp;page_6_0=1&amp;amp;page_7_0=1&amp;amp;newsearch=1&amp;amp;type=all&amp;amp;order=relevance"&gt;Epimetheus’ irregular shape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5451/Groundhog_Day_on_Saturn"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/cassini_epimetheusshadow.jpg" alt="Cassini picture of the moon Epimetheus’s shadow on the rings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other moons are creating these dances as well; here is the even smaller &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=3937"&gt;flying-saucer-shaped&lt;/a&gt; Pan (just 20 km (12 miles) across) as it orbits in a gap in the rings, casting its own shadow across the rings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5495/Pans_Very_Own_Shadow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/cassini_panshadow.jpg" alt="Cassini picture of the moon Pan’s shadow on the rings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see the moon Pan in the gap in the rings and its shadow? It’s tiny in that version, so take a look at this zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/cassini_panmshadow_zoom.jpg" alt="Cassini zoomed picture of the moon Pan’s shadow on the rings"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa, cool. Pan is actually orbiting in that ring gap, so the rings have to be almost perfectly edge-on to the Sun to get that shadow. Right now that’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the case; there’s still a bit of a tilt. But as Saturn orbits the Sun that angle will diminish, and in a few months (in August) it’ll be precisely 0. Then we’ll see the shadows stretching out along the rings, lengthened the same way your own shadow is elongated at sunset. As we approach this point in time — what’s really the Equinox on Saturn, the same as the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/19/its-the-eggquinox/"&gt;Equinox&lt;/a&gt; we just had on Earth — well see this more and more, so expect a ton more devastating animations and images from Cassini in the months to come!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237829715110"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4445">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/532cdcef8fe03da3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="crime"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Not as Authentic as It Seems</title><published>2009-03-23T17:30:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T17:30:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/2dcRm-en5c4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/not-as-authentic-as-it-seems/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I was recently reading a famous old economics paper called "The Fable of the Bees," by Steven N.S.

Siblings and Acceptance: &lt;a href="http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4735726/"&gt;Samantha McLeod (13) wrote a book&lt;/a&gt; called  &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback_book/normal/4395668"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Normal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which she sets out to make her autistic brother "normal"--after she figures out what "normal" is.  Her conclusion? "'No one is normal. Everyone is a freak,' she [Samantha] said."  (Note: I've not read the book.)  Opposing Views ran a &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/articles/opinion-how-do-siblings-affect-autistic-kids"&gt;piece on siblings&lt;/a&gt; and Media Dis-n-Dat ran a Chicago WLS-TV &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/03/program-supports-nondisabled-siblings.html"&gt;story on Sibshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Theatre and Acceptance: Aaron Jungels of Everett Dance Theatre created &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-multimedia-theater-performance.html"&gt;a multi-media performance&lt;/a&gt; piece "Silas the Teenager" inspired by his favorite nephew Silas who is autistic.  From the story: "By interweaving video projection, dialogue, choreography, and the use of kinetic-sculptural stage props, Jungels reflects upon the way Silas perceives the world. Excerpts from interviews include the perspectives and anecdotes of Silas's parents and siblings." Jungles works with themes of understanding, acceptance, bridge building, and reducing communication barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Jessica Park's Art: The Boston Globe did an niece story on &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/03/22/for_an_artist_with_autism_precision_is_all/?page=1"&gt;Jessica Park&lt;/a&gt; the now older adult who was the basis for the books &lt;em&gt;The Siege&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Exiting Nirvana&lt;/em&gt;.  While the Globe article included a lot about Park' art and the value of letting people pursue their passions, it does not include any pictures of Park' paintings--you can see Park' art at &lt;a href="http://www.jessicapark.com/index.html"&gt;her web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Dora's Week Off: I have a lot going on this week--an art show I'm preparing for, a workshop I'm attending, various other unusual obligations sure to make me incoherent.  So I'll be handing my side of the blog over to my good friend &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/profile/view/403974"&gt;Elesia&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the week.

Since there seems to be enough fans here, though, I&amp;#39;ll turn you loose on it. Great? Sucked? Eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't watch it because I haven't watched much of the series at all. There are a couple of reasons: 1) I'm old enough to remember the &lt;i&gt;original&lt;/i&gt; BSG, and was not at all interested (I know, it&amp;#39;s radically different, but I didn&amp;#39;t know that at the beginning); 2) it&amp;#39;s on the Sci-Fi Channel, which has become the label of instant recognition for cheesy formulaic crap; 3) I did see a few episodes early in the run, and was turned off by the god-happy nonsense in those few shows — again, I heard that they went off in some interesting directions after that, but the damage was done to my impression, and 4) it&amp;#39;s the kind of series that demands long investment in the full story, and I&amp;#39;ve never had the time to catch up with it all. I may grab the DVD of the whole series at some point, just to give it the attention so many people tell me it deserves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/battlestar_galactica_open_thre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DGeie8zZ6YI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237826127294"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_632.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84162ce4f0d43aed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-03-23T16:45:18Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T16:45:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ETbg7NBYrJ0/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_632.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_632.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_632.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_632.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ETbg7NBYrJ0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237826127294"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/todays_carnivals_349.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd602a3f2b5030ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-03-23T16:40:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T16:40:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/M1vnVukbE8E/todays_carnivals_349.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/todays_carnivals_349.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;World Water Day synchroblogging is up on &lt;a href="http://crikeycreekblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/transboundary-waterblogging.html" title=""&gt;Crikey Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I found out today their letter has had a very positive effect: on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Pharmedia News Reports&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;Commentary on Media Reports Worldwide that Affect Pharmacy&amp;quot;), their editor responded to the Australian ad, saying &amp;quot;we recommend that all practicing pharmacists evaluate what the Skeptics have to say, and if any part of your daily practice needs reviewing, then please take the time to undertake a proper adjustment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! And it gets better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following extracts were collated from the Pharmacy Board of NSW bulletins by Gerard McInerny (president).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative medical practice or therapies, such as iridology, aromatherapy, reflexology, homeopathy and similar “natural” approaches to health care have apparently found a place in the community, but the Board can see little or no place for them in the practice of pharmacy. Regardless of any pharmacist’s other heath care interests, no pharmacist may ever disregard their standing in the community as a provider of primary health care…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a recommendation by any pharmacist for a therapy or medicine gives that therapy or medicine special credibility, it is essential that the recommendation is soundly and scientifically based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s fantastic, and great to hear. &lt;strong&gt;Congrats to the Australian Skeptics! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second win for real medicine was in the UK. Prince Charles is a noted supporter of alternative medicine, and has a company called Duchy Originals. This company makes some sketchy claims about their products detoxifying the body (something that your body does just fine all by its lonesome, just look up what the liver and kidneys do). A consumer complained about these ads, and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/21/prince-charles-duchy-originals"&gt;lookee what happened&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven weeks of deliberation the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the licensing body responsible for assessing herbal medicines for safety, upheld the complaint prompting the company to change the wording of the adverts and remove the previous claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay again! Now, the company of course has claimed that they say their product is a &amp;quot;supplement&amp;quot;, and not a medicine or a cure. Lots of sham companies in the US make this same claim about their product, too. They have commercials that go on and on about what their product does to make you feel better, solving this body problem, fixing that condition. But then, in teeny tiny letters it says &amp;quot;This product not evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration&amp;quot;, which essentially means they’re lying. It’s incredible to me that some company can create pills that people can take internally, claim they’ll make you bigger or smaller or faster or pain-free or detoxified, &lt;em&gt;and these claims are not tested at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just that these pills almost certainly don’t do what they claim; they can also react to other pills you may be taking (science-based or not) and cause grievous health problems, such as, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.nt.gov.au/health/healthdev/health_promotion/bushbook/volume2/chap1/kava.htm"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m thrilled that real science is making headway. There’s a long long way to go, but this is good progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237823508224"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=6091">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7289fd0ca9416c4b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Bernie Madoff"/><title type="html">Thank God It Was $65 Billion</title><published>2009-03-23T16:23:16Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T16:23:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/0GiPmkYgZrY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/thank-god-it-was-65-billion/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">When Bernie Madoff turned himself in, his firm owed investors $65 billion, but had only about a billion dollars on hand.

Babies. Not toddlers. Not preschoolers. Babies. It’s called &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourbabycanread.com"&gt;Your Baby Can Read®&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s going to revolutionize the way we teach reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Titzer, PhD (yes, he’s both a doctor &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a PhD) claims that by waiting until preschool or kindergarten to introduce reading, we are not only hampering our children’s abilities to learn how to read, but also crushing their ability to develop reading skills as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.yourbabycanread.com/skins/Skin_36/images/dvd_set.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="148"&gt;Instead,  Doc Bobby Titz PhD has developed a *New*! and *Improved*! method of teaching kids to read.  All you have to do is buy his program (for the low low price of just $200) and plop your newborn in front of the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I’m not even being snarky about the newborn bit. His DVD’s are most effective when introduced at 3 months of age… after that the learning window starts to slowly close. If your kid is older than 3 months, relax, you still have time, just remember that every hour you wait is an hour your child will spend becoming irreversibly dumber until he’s pretty much permanently functionally illiterate by the age of 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Really, there just isn’t enough pressure these days to create perfect little over achievers. There’s nothing adding to parental insecurities. And have you noticed no one is out there promoting those condescending and petty my-baby-is-better-than-yours competitions between parents on playgrounds everywhere? Doesn’t anyone care anymore about totally fucking up kids with neurotic and unnecessary pressure to be the most developmentally advanced of all their peers?  (I’ve  been feeling a lot of pressure lately thinking that I’m the only one trying to get the message out. Every Tuesday I spend the day at the local NICUs handing out informational pamphlets titled &lt;em&gt;Prepping your newborn for success: A Parent’s guide to getting your child into the best kindergarten pre-med programs;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;12 weeks to Calculus: the dangers of ending your maternity leave before your baby learns advanced math&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raising Twins: don’t double your disappointment&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In actuality, the BobbyTits method is far from revolutionary. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="173705-2" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/173705-2-221x300.jpg" alt="173705-2" width="221" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend $200 on a reading system and BobbyTits mails it to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beaming with pride that your baby will be the last of his peers to sit up due to the weight of the knowledge in his head, you open the box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics to not let your kid watch TV until he’s at least 2, you pop the DVD in, and sit your illiterate disappointment of a newborn in front of the TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You log onto parenting forums to tell people not to vaccinate their kids and then take some “What kind of _____ are you?” quizzes on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An hour later, you return to your baby only to find that he can now read!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The Titz system is literally video flashcards - flashcards without the annoying responsibility of personally going over the content of the cards with your child. The DVD shows a word, someone says the word out loud, and then there is a short video clip of the word. For example, the screen shows “EAT”. Then someone says “eeeeeeeeeeet”. Then baby sees someone eating for 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The fact that this isn’t really even reading, but just association, does not bother Bobbytits. In fact he freely admits it on his site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the babies simply memorizing the words or are they actually reading?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: It is true that the babies initially memorize the shapes of the written words, but over time they will figure out the patterns of the written language in a way that is similar to how they figure out the patterns of the spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, to me that says that you are giving them flash cards; they memorize the flash cards and then they figure out how to read later when someone teaches them about things like phonics and the alphabet… you know, when they actually learn &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; reading works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, no. I’m wrong. The YBCR program is backed by RealScyence™! Just look at this very convincing statisical graph from their FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.yourbabycanread.com/skins/Skin_36/images/graph.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="254"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Yes, according to “scientific studies”, the majority of 2nd graders read at a 2nd grade level. They also “cite” “scientific studies” that “late age readers” read at a lower level than other kids their age. Even if we concede that this information is accurate (for the record, there are about a billion ways this data is probably skewed), they present it as if it’s something to fear, but it’s not. If a kid starts school later than other kids his age (thus being “introduced to reading” later), for whatever reason, he’s generally going to be behind other kids&lt;em&gt; his age&lt;/em&gt;. This chart leaves out information like whether the kid who starts reading at 6 1/2 is excelling or lagging behind other kids in &lt;em&gt;his grade level&lt;/em&gt;. Sure, at the age of 10 he’s reading at a 4th grade level, compared with a 5th grade level for other 10 year olds, but is this kid even in 5th grade? Maybe he’s only in 3rd grade. It’s quite fair to say that most of these “late reading” kids are about one grade behind other kids their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Most schools in Illinois have a September 1st birthday cut off for enrollment. This means that your son or daughter has to be 5 years old by Sept 1 in order to get into kindergarten in any given school year. So if your daughter is born Sept 2, she will have to wait until she’s 6 to start school. According to this chart, if she starts reading at the same time as her other &lt;em&gt;classmates&lt;/em&gt;, she’ll actually be reading at a level more advanced than her peers until around 5th grade when things seem to average out. (In fact, there are even parents who &lt;a href="http://www.kidsource.com/education/red.shirting.html"&gt;“red shirt”&lt;/a&gt; their 5-year-olds just to give them this advantage, arguing that older children are more intellectually mature and ready to learn.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Using this information, Dr. PhD then creates a carefully crafted and seductive non-sequitur argument that if most kids learn at an average pace, and kids who fall behind learn at a slowed pace, then by using his program, and learning to read early, babies read at a more advanced level. And he charts the evidence to convince you of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But the evidence for his program isn’t “cited scientific studies” like the ones he’s using to gather his comparative data; it’s evidence “based on information from children tested after learning to read using Your Baby Can Read”. Tested? How? How many children? How often were they tested? Once? Monthly? Tested while using the system? After? Were they tested before using the system? Are they receiving other reading instruction? Are they developmentally advanced in other areas? Tested by whom? Are these results typical? Can we see the study? No? Ok, then I’m holding on to my $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here’s the thing - there’s already a really great program available to parents that doesn’t cost $200. It’s proven. It’s recommended by child development experts almost unanimously. The problem is, you can’t bottle it up and market it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;All you have to do is sit down with your baby, every day, and read to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Show them books. Show them words. Talk to them about the words, interact with them during the story. The cost of this program is whatever you want it to be, as low as the cost of transportation to the library up to whatever you can budget for books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Yes, it’s more work. You can’t do the dishes or fold the laundry or work on employee reviews while you’re doing it. You can’t Google stalk the cheerleaders from your high school. You can’t catch up on the news or go over your fantasy baseball lineup one more time. But that’s the point. You can’t teach your kid by plopping him in front of the TV. You teach your kid to read by reading. Sooner than you’re ready, your baby will read, and when she does, it will blow your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Your daughter doesn’t need Your Baby Can Read. She needs her parents. She needs people to show her not only how to read, but why to read, to show her the fun of reading, to teach her the importance of reading.  Learning to love books and love reading is going to offer your baby benefits that this douche can’t put on a misleading scare-tactic chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;This is your child’s education, not a Walmart New Hire orientation. You can’t do it with a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;All Dr Titz’s program is going to do is take $200 out of your book budget. That’s about 20 books a kid isn’t going to own because of his parents’  need for him to learn to read early. Perhaps Dr. Titz never read the definition of “irony”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237823065232"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6581">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d69fe3ab8d890e3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 3.23</title><published>2009-03-23T12:45:30Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T12:45:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6581" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

But it's not like that. Not only is the list of prepositions longer than people think (probably over 200 items in all), it is growing.  New prepositions pop up from time to time, some borrowed from other languages and others derived from various sources within English.  Brett Reynolds and Rodney Huddleston have discovered a new one.  Brett heard somebody say (about a water contamination in Walkerton, Ontario): "How is the water, post Walkerton?"  And he suspected this meant &lt;i&gt;post&lt;/i&gt; had to be a preposition, so he mailed Huddleston about it.  Huddleston had already collected an example of the same kind: &lt;i&gt;Post the wash-out from the credit crunch, most assets globally were overpriced&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;The Weekend Australian&lt;/i&gt;, 26-27 April 2008, page 39).  And then just today he got a piece of mail including the sentence &lt;i&gt;Post the entitlement offer, the only remaining bank facility is with ABN AMRO Bank&lt;/i&gt;.  That's three. Get used to it, folks: we have a new preposition amongst us.  &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; is already in most dictionaries as a prefix.  Expect the dictionaries to add "&lt;i&gt;prep&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; to the entry in…  oh, about fifty years or so would be my guess (dictionaries don&amp;#39;t exactly work like greased lightning when it comes down to new usages like this: the new words they add every year or two are mostly new nouns).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Ken Ham is complaining that one of his staff members was "ambushed", because he wasn't given a solo interview, but had to share the discussion with a critic (meanwhile, Ham has no compunction about "ambushing", in the same sense, scientific discussions). What I found most interesting, though, were &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/03/21/bbc-radio-and-ambush-journalism/"&gt;Ken Ham's complaints about the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past week, Dr. Jason Lisle--our astrophysicist&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;—was invited to be on a BBC radio program out of Southampton , England (where I spoke a couple of weeks ago). We were told that it was just going to be an &amp;quot;examination of creationism.&amp;quot; Well, we are somewhat leery when it comes to dealing with the British media--by far, British journalists and commentators (and particularly those from the BBC) are the most mocking about biblical Christianity of all the media we&amp;#39;ve worked with over the years. We have had probably 20 different countries send reporters to the Creation Museum since we opened 22 months ago, and most of them have been fair and balanced in their coverage--but not so with the typical British reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a bow, any typical British reporters reading this. Could you please come over here and give lessons to typical American reporters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;You have to giggle at the idea of an astrophysicist who claims that the universe is only 6000 years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/high_praise_for_british_journa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/OZsWneqo-CY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237819287315"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pope_caught_mining_irony_in_af.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab56ef7023c528f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Pope caught mining irony in Africa</title><published>2009-03-23T14:14:09Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T14:14:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/aQnisR3aJyE/pope_caught_mining_irony_in_af.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pope_caught_mining_irony_in_af.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Pope is on a grand tour of Africa, where he has been striking up a theme of — brace yourself — opposing superstition. The man who heads an institution with an &lt;a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/7047/the-vaticans-top-exorcist-sends-the-devil-packing"&gt;official top exorcist&lt;/a&gt; is asking Africans to &lt;a href="http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=d1f6f272-055c-466d-9acf-2f7aea5319cc"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"shun witchcraft"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and to reject fear-mongering talk of evil entities…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his homily, he urged his listeners to reach out to those Angolans who believe in witchcraft and spirits. &lt;span&gt;"So many of them are living in fear of spirits, of malign and threatening powers. In their bewilderment they even end up condemning street children and the elderly as alleged sorcerers,"&lt;/span&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. Don't believe in malign spirits, like, say &lt;i&gt;Satan&lt;/i&gt;. Has the Pope become an atheist lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I guess not. He's still demanding that people believe in supernatural occult powers that have battled and defeated other supernatural occult powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his homily, the pope urged Catholics to try to persuade those who had left the Church that &lt;span&gt;"Christ has triumphed over death and all those occult powers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only they would turn their powers of skepticism, critical thought, and rejection of unfounded supernatural phenomena on themselves, the Vatican would implode overnight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pope_caught_mining_irony_in_af.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/aQnisR3aJyE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237819287314"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/coyne_gets_interviewed.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3834b07e316d90fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating science"/><title type="html">Coyne gets interviewed</title><published>2009-03-23T14:04:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T14:04:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/qPBKGURKJss/coyne_gets_interviewed.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/coyne_gets_interviewed.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jerry Coyne says lots of basic (but well-stated) things about evolution, creationism, and education in &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/an-interview-with-jerry-coyne"&gt;an interview with American Scientist&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a taste:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some creationists seem to feel that it's the scientists who are being dogmatic here--that you're somehow invested in this idea or want it to be true, or that your training has blinded you to other possibilities. How do you respond to that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they're the ones who are dogmatic, because the difference between religion and science, which is the difference between religion and evolution, is that we question things. Nobody worships Darwin as a religion. We don't adhere to a set of dogmas that are unchanging and unquestionable. We all recognize that Darwin was wrong about a lot of stuff. His theories of genetics were wrong, his theories of biogeography were wrong--that's been corrected by plate tectonics--his stuff on sexual selection is very good but not complete. Evolutionary biology is constantly changing and revising its conclusions. But the main conclusions that Darwin made--that evolution occurred, that it occurred through natural selection, that there were common ancestry and splitting and that it happened slowly--those have all been supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some thoughts on something that has been bothering me for a while. How do we know the world is the way it is? Easy, a pragmatic person would say, just look and measure. We see a tree, a chair, a table; we hear the wind, music, people talking. We feel heat and cold against our skin. Once our brains integrate this sensorial information, we have a conception of what is real that allows us to function in the world. We know where to go, what to eat, what not to touch; we enjoy a good meal, a nice hug. But what happens when we go beyond our senses, using tools to extend our conception of reality? We don’t see galaxies with the naked eye (well, maybe Andromeda on a moonless, dry night) and much less a carbon atom. How do we know they are there, that they exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Galileo showed his telescope to the Venetian senators in 1609, some refused to accept that what they saw was real. More recently, late in the 19th century, physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach refused to accept the existence of atoms, claiming they would never be seen and hence couldn’t be proven to exist. Mach and the Venetian senators were wrong. What we see through telescopes is, of course, perfectly real; we capture photons—particles of light—that a celestial body emits (or reflects, for planets and moons). If the source doesn’t emit in the visible and is so dim that we can’t capture photons between red and violet, we capture photons from radio or infrared radiation, no less real even though our eyes can’t see them. When atomic electrons jump from orbit to orbit, they also emit (or absorb) photons that can be detected by instruments or, in the case of certain transitions, by our eyes. The instruments we use in the study of natural phenomena are an extension of our senses. This amplification of reality is one of the most spectacular feats of science, allowing us to see beyond the visible. So far, so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation gets complicated when the complexity of the phenomenon forces us to filter the data, and we select to study only part of what is happening. Our brains, of course, do this all the time, what we call “focus”; otherwise, we would be flooded with such an absurd amount of sounds and images that we wouldn’t be able to do anything. When we look at a star with the naked eye or with an optical telescope, we only see part of it, what it emits in the visible. A complete view of the star would incorporate all of its emissions, in the infrared, ultraviolet, x rays, etc. This fact has a simple but, to my mind, profound consequence: our construction of reality, being necessarily filtered, is incomplete. We only know what we can measure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of elementary particle physics the situation is even more alarming. The Large Hadron Collider, for example, should start working this coming summer or early fall. In its full capacity, it should produce around 600 million collisions per second. This translates to about 700 megabytes per second of data, more than 10 petabytes (1015) per year. That’s more than a million hard drives, each with a gigabyte. To make sense of this flood of information, physicists have to filter the data, selecting events deemed “interesting.” This selection, in turn, is based on our current theories that speculate on what’s beyond the standard model of particle physics, that is, theories that speculate on stuff we don’t know is there. Although these theories are mostly pretty solid (the Higgs particle as universal giver of mass; extensions of the standard model using more than one Higgs, supersymmetry or/and more than three spatial dimensions…) they can only be confirmed through the very same experiments whose outcome they are trying to predict. Given this mechanism, there is a risk that unexpected phenomena, not predicted by any current theory and hence not included in the subset of collisions deemed interesting, will be eliminated by the data filtering process. In this case, and in a paradoxical way, the theories that we construct to amplify our view of physical reality  will actually limit what we can know about nature.  &lt;/p&gt;

WE KNOW THIS! And we also know that once people believe something to be true they will seek to confirm it and they will discount contrary evidence. WE KNOW THIS! One example of this is the Placebo effect (see video below). So once again, what exactly is wrong with being skeptical about that which we were taught to believe? Christian, don't say that I must also be skeptical of that which I affirm, because I am. That's why I describe myself as an agnostic atheist.

&lt;p&gt;More than two years ago, I wrote a post entitled &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/death_by_alternative_medicine_whos_to_bl.php"&gt;Death by Alternative Medicine: Who's to Blame?&lt;/a&gt; The topic of the post was a case  report that I had heard while visiting the tumor board of an affiliate of my former cancer center describing a young woman who had rejected conventional therapy for an eminently treatable breast cancer and then returned two or three years later with a large, nasty tumor that was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more difficult to treat and possibly metastatic to the bone, which, if ture, would have made it no longer even possibly curable. My discussion centered on what the obligation of physicians are to such patients who utterly refuse the science- and evidence-based medicine that we know to be able to cure them of a potentially fatal disease and centered on the reaction of one oncologist who stated that it is the collected "our fault" (as in all the physicians who saw her) that she ended up this way because "we" had failed to persuade her that what she was doing would at the very least delay her treatment and make it much harder to treat her when her tumor did progress to the point where she realized that whatever woo she had chose was not working and at the very worse cost her her life. Even more compelling and sad, this patient was young, in her late 30s, and had three young children. Her husband had even filed for divorce and custody of the children on the quite reasonable, but no doubt painful to come to, basis that she would soon no longer be able to take care of them and had rebuffed all attempts to persuade her to accept science- and evidence-based medical care that could still possibly save her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that post, I've always been meaning to take a look at what, exactly, the effect of choosing "alternative" medicine over "conventional" medicine is on the odds of survival for breast cancer patients. Even though intuitively one would hypothesize that refusing scientific medicine and relying on placebo medicine instead would have a detrimental effect on survival, it turns out that this question is not as easy to answer as one might think. For example, if you do a search on PubMed using terms like "alternative medicine," "breast cancer," and "survival," the vast majority of the hits will be studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and breast cancer with little reference to what possible effect these therapies might have on overall survival and breast cancer-related mortality. I can speculate about several posisble reasons for this, although I don't know how valid my guesses are as to why. The first reason may be that--thankfully--relatively few women use alternative medicine primarily or exclusively to treat their breast cancers. It can't be overstated how this is a very good thing. Also, those who do use only alternative medicine probably drop off the radar screen of their "conventinal" doctors, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture data regarding their outcomes. All too often they stick with their alternative healers until the end, going from one to another as their tumors eat through their skin and ravage their bodies. True, they may pop up again in their surgeon's or primary care doctor's office with huge, fungating tumors, only to be told that they have to undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before any surgery is possible, after which they will often disappear again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/does_alternative_medicine_use_result_in.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/does_alternative_medicine_use_result_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/XKY3P0ppWJQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237813217469"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/23/science-is-a-pain-in-the-neck/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c7d2546f3579481</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Science is a pain in the neck</title><published>2009-03-23T13:00:09Z</published><updated>2009-03-23T13:00:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/23/science-is-a-pain-in-the-neck/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My friend Christian is married to my other friend Maria, who is a Skepchick. Christian just had his thyroid removed, and Maria, whom I love with all my heart, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6530"&gt;wrote a fantastic personal piece&lt;/a&gt; about how science has saved her husband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay has some NSFW language in it, and I can’t blame her: if some garbage pseudoscience were on TV while I sat with my spouse who was recovering from a life-saving procedure made possible by centuries of disparate scientific achievement, I’d want to reach through the TV and throttle all the liars who advertise there too.&lt;/p&gt;

This week the Texas Board of Education will vote on whether or not to replace the “strengths and weaknesses” language that existed in the state’s science standards for the last 20 years, but was removed this Winter by a narrow 1-vote margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle represents the latest strategy of creationists to either hamper the teaching of evolution or introduce creationist ideas into the science classroom under the banner of “academic freedom.” The basic concept is that teachers, students, and school systems should have the academic freedom to: teach both the strengths and weaknesses of scientific theories, use outside (unapproved) material in teaching their classes, and believe whatever they wish without penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academic freedom strategy is getting some traction. Americans are generally for freedom, and the bills and language used to promote their agenda with “academic freedom” may appear innocuous on the surface. This strategy is specifically designed to skirt the constitutional barriers to teaching creationism in public schools, and has yet to be tested on constitutional grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims of creationists (and for practical purposes I will use the term “creationist” to refer to anyone denying evolution to a significant degree, from young-earth creationists to intelligent design proponents who accept common descent) is that “Darwinists” are dogmatic, they wish to censor critical discussion of evolution and shield it from criticism.  They are, of course, completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major flaws with the academic freedom claim. The first is that it ignores the need for quality control in academia. School systems at every level have the right and responsibility to ensure quality education. This means that the teaching of science should acurately reflect the consensus of scientific opinion, should be based upon legitimate scientific methods, evidence, and thinking, and should teach how to think scientifically and critically. Schools have a right to demand that teachers teach approved curricula and that they do not teach their personal beliefs as science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major flaw in the academic freedom concept is that it is unnecessary. It is already part of teaching science to teach the strengths and weakness of theories, reflect genuine controversies, and discuss alternative theories when legitimate ones exist. Science educators do not want to pretend that controversies do not exist, or to shield evolution or any other theory from legitimate criticism. That is a completely false charge - and it is the major premise of the academic freedom movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoters of academic freedom tend to be creationists who want to introduce false criticisms and controversies into science classroom - arguments that have not passed scientific muster or have been long rejected on logical or factual grounds. Having lost the scientific battle they wish to change the venue to the political arena and use politics to have their bad arguments introduced into science class. Their agenda is entirely transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian’s Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Wayne Christian has introduced bill HB 4224 in Texas, which will do two things. It will replace the “strengths and weaknesses” language in the Texas science standards, and Christian also decided to up the ante a bit. He also would include language that protects students and teachers who profess belief that is not in accord with accepted science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the specific change to the “strengths and weaknesses” language that was made a few months ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Language: “Analyze, review, and critique scientific explanations, including hypotheses and theories, as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Language: “Analyze and evaluate scientific explanations using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freemarket.org/Legislature_Issues_SBOEtalkingpoints.aspx"&gt;Creationists argue&lt;/a&gt; that the new language would enforce teaching only the positives of evolution and would ban teaching any weaknesses. That is absurd, and reflects a misunderstanding of science. “Analyze and evaluate” requires addressing any evidence for or against a theory, and also any competing theories. What creationists don’t get is that there are no legitimate alternatives to evolution, and the arguments they put forward as weaknesses are psudoscientific rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they make the same claim back at scientists, saying that the “strengths and weaknesses” language, that has been in the Texas science standards for 20 years, has not resulted in the introduction of religious beliefs into the science classroom or hurt science education.  I do not know of any data from Texas itself, but &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/05/one-in-eight-hi.html"&gt;surveys show&lt;/a&gt; that as many as 25% of high school science teachers devote class time to teaching creationism. Only 40% think that creationism has no place in science class - which means that perhaps the number would be as high as 60% if science standards and the law did not prohibit it. In other words - standards matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second proposition of the bill - protecting students and teachers from being penalized for their beliefs - is a more complex issue. It all depends on how such a provision is construed and enforced. &lt;a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/state_news/story/1264169.html"&gt;Christian claims that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can be lazy if they want to . . . but teachers are still in charge of the grading system,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is cold comfort if teachers are also protected, meaning that teachers could decide that if a student gives a creationist answer on a test they may be graded as correct. Steven Schafersman, president of Texas Citizens for Science says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Students could claim they believe anything they wanted in anything in science and if that’s what they say, the teacher would be forced to give that student an A.  That’s how bad this bill is written.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen the language of the bill itself (if anyone can find a link to the text, please put it in the comments). The details matter, in my opinion. I think such a provision is unnecessary, like the strengths and weaknesses language, and so such a bill would either be redundant or harmful, but not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that students should be graded on what they know, not what they believe. So, for example, they should be required to demonstrate that they understand the course material on evolution. They do not have to state, however, that they in fact “believe” in evolution. But this is the way science class works now. I don’t remember ever being quizzed as to my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schafersman’s fear, shared by many scientists, is that the language will be applied in such a way that a student could give the answer “Godidit” to any science question and the teacher would be forced to give them an A. Or, a teacher could teach their personal religious beliefs as science and be protected from any mechanism of quality control. If the law does not do this - then what does it do? Why is it necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been individual science teachers (at the college level, I am not aware of any at the high school level) who used “belief” as a measure of understanding - if a student truly understands the science then they will accept the conclusions, they argue. The consensus, however, appears to be against these few exceptions. I think the scientific and educational communities should be clear on this point - teachers impart knowledge and understanding, they don’t demand belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly we are seeing the battleground on evolution and creationism over the next decade or so - “academic freedom” and its many incarnations. Once again the creationists are using false arguments to push their transparently religious agenda. Our job is to point this out clearly to the public, while highlighting the risks to quality science education.&lt;/p&gt;

DO NOT READ IF YOU DON’T WANT TO KNOW***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SciFi’s Battlestar Galactica ended Friday.  Having &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1354"&gt;written about the show here before&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d weigh in on the much anticipated finale.  I don’t think I’m alone in saying that from the first episode right on through the penultimate show last week, this was some of the best science fiction I had ever seen.  The writing was consistently flawless, continually engaging, and always unpredictable.  The characters were interesting and felt real.  The special effects were cool.  I absolutely loved everything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in one fell swoop, Ronald Moore destroyed it all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not even sure where to begin.  This ending has me completely at a loss.  Over the past year or so, everything coming from Moore and the cast on how it would wrap up was about how bleak and nihilistic and unhappy the ending would be, and this seemed consistent with the general no-punches-pulled attitude of the series.  The way it actually closed seemed pollyanna-ish compared with what was expected; and that’s not to say that I wanted to see everyone die.  It’s just that this ending did not feel right.  It didn’t fit with the tone of the show.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole anti-science, destroy all technology and start over thing was annoying, but I could almost understand why the characters would make that decision after what they’d been through.  At the same time, it was such a disjointed thing to do after just a few episodes ago making my science-y little heart sing with Anders’ speech about wanting to be connected to the mathematics of the universe (among other things).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the part that really pissed me off: answering every deep and intriguing mystery with a shrug and a simple “God did it.”  WHAT THE FRAK?!  (That is the last time I will ever use that word.)  It felt cheap, like they took the easy way out.  To end such a well-crafted story with that kind of cop-out resolution (if you can even call it that) is beyond infuriating.  I feel so cheated.  I know it’s just a TV show, but I’ve invested a lot of time in this story and these characters and to have them sold so short feels like a betrayal.  They were owed more than this.  When Ronald Moore showed up onscreen at the end, I wanted to punch him in his smarmy little face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more than that, when you start to really think about it, this finale is full of plot holes and inconsistencies.  It’s almost like he thought people would either love it and overlook the fact that the story didn’t make sense, or they’d hate it and not care.  I know I’m repeating myself, but it just doesn’t fit.  4 years of great writing only to be wasted in a lazy wrap-up.  If I worked on the show, especially as a writer, I would be profoundly angry.  Well, I guess I am pretty profoundly angry as it is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote last year that Battlestar Galactica was and could be a great show despite its roots in Mormon mythology, and it was, almost to the end.  I was deceived.

However, a few stand out for having provoked hundreds of comments. The very first post that provoked hundreds of comments was Harriet’s excellent discussion of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=22"&gt;International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Harriet seems to be quite good at writing posts that provoke a lot of comment, as another of her posts, specifically the one in which she &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=269"&gt;discussed circumcision&lt;/a&gt;, also garnered hundreds of comments. However, to my great surprise, the one post that stands out as having received the most comments thus far in the history of SBM is one that I wrote. Specifically, it was a post I called &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=15"&gt;Death by “alternative” medicine: Who’s to blame?&lt;/a&gt;, which has collected an astonishing 611 comments thus far. The topic of the post was a case report that I had heard while visiting the tumor board of an affiliate of my former cancer center describing a young woman who had rejected conventional therapy for an eminently treatable breast cancer and then returned two or three years later with a large, nasty tumor that was much more difficult to treat and possibly metastatic to the bone, which would make it no longer even potentially curable. My discussion centered on what the obligation of a physician is to such patients who utterly refuse the science- and evidence-based medicine that we know to be able to cure them of a potentially fatal disease, and I was not only surprised but somewhat taken aback by the vehemence of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that post, I’ve always been meaning to take a look at what, exactly, the effect of choosing “alternative” medicine over “conventional” medicine is on the odds of survival for breast cancer patients. Even though intuitively one would hypothesize that refusing scientific medicine and relying on placebo medicine instead would have a detrimental effect on survival, it turns out that this question is not as easy to answer as you might think. For example, if you do a search on PubMed using terms like “alternative medicine,” “breast cancer,” and “survival,” the vast majority of the hits will be studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and breast cancer with little reference to what possible effect these therapies might have on survival. I can envision several reasons for this, the first being that–thankfully–relatively few women actually use alternative medicine exclusively to treat their breast cancer. Also, those that do probably drop off the radar screen of their science-based practitioners, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture data regarding their outcomes, given that they all too often stick with their alternative healers until the end. True, they may pop up again in their surgeon’s or primary care doctor’s office with huge, fungating tumors, only to be told that they have to undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before any surgery is possible, after which they will often disappear again. Another important reason is that the natural history of breast cancer is extremely variable, from nasty, aggressive tumors that kill within months to indolent, slow-growing tumors that, even when metastatic, women can survive with for several years. (It is, of course, these women who usually show up in “alternative medicine” testimonials, because they can survive a long time with little or no treatment before their tumors progress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s important to understand the natural history of breast cancer, I’ll reference a classic study examining the natural history of untreated breast cancer. It was published in 1962 by &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1925646"&gt;H. J. G. Bloom, W. W. Richardson, and E. J. Harries&lt;/a&gt;, and examined data from Middlesex Hospital from 1805 to 1933 where 250 cases of untreated breast cancer were identified and studied. They calculated survival as the period of time from onset of symptoms to death. What they found was that 18% of the 250 patients survived five years; 3.6% survived 10 years; and 0.8% survived 15 years. Of note, it was 19 years before all patients were dead. Overall, the median survival was 2.7 years. A survival graph from this classic paper is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3373236628/" title="Fig1 by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3625/3373236628_e9ebaa7c2b_o.jpg" width="500" height="431" alt="Fig1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that all of these tumors were detected as (at the very minimum) lumps in the breast, given that there was no other way of detecting them at the time. However, the reason we go back to this study time and time again is because, at least in developed countries, it is the rare woman with breast cancer who does not undergo treatment of some kind for it. These days, most tumors are detected at far less advanced stages; indeed, most are detected by mammography. What that means is that, if such a study could be done today, it is very likely that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;lead time bias&lt;/a&gt; would significantly increase the apparent median survival, because increasingly tiny tumors are being found. It is also possible that a significant number of such small tumors &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;may spontaneously regress&lt;/a&gt;, which further complicates the issue today, not to mention making it easier to find women who have rejected some or all of “conventional” medicine to treat their cancers and survived significant lengths of time to produce &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=403"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=10"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this background, I have found a couple of studies that can help answer the question. The first one was published in 2005 in the &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16041219"&gt;Annals of Surgery&lt;/a&gt; by a group in from Geneva University Hospitals. This study involved a search of Switzerland’s database between 1975 and 2000 and included 5,339 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer.  The strength of this study is that the Geneva Cancer Registry includes data from all patients from the Geneva canton who underwent treatment and allowed the investigators to compare the outcomes of the women who refused to undergo surgery with curative intent with those who underwent surgery. In the Registry, there were identified 70 patients (1.3%) who refused surgery and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These women [those who refused surgery] were older, more frequently single, and had larger tumors. Overall, 37 (53%) women had no treatment, 25 (36%) hormone-therapy alone, and 8 (11%) other adjuvant treatments alone or in combination. Five-year specific breast cancer survival of women who refused surgery was lower than that of those who accepted (72%, 95% confidence interval, 60%–84% versus 87%, 95% confidence interval, 86%–88%, respectively). After accounting for other prognostic factors including tumor characteristics and stage, women who refused surgery had a 2.1-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.5–3.1) increased risk to die of breast cancer compared with operated women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that this is not a randomized study; rather, it is a retrospective study. Consequently, it’s impossible to rule out selection bias, but, as the authors point out, this is one case where doing a randomized study is completely unethical. Moreover, half the women accepted some form of other standard, effective treatm,ent, such as hormonal therapy alone. In any case, what this study shows is that women with no surgery can still live a long time, but are far more likely to die of their cancer than women who do undergo surgical extirpation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can find, there is one study that specifically looked at the question of what happens to women who opt for alternative medicine instead of scientific medicine. This study, like the one I just cited, was published in the surgical literature, namely &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16978951?ordinalpos=10&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;American Journal of Surgery&lt;/a&gt;. Given the nature of the question it was seeking to answer, its design is single-armed and retrospective, using prognosis estimated by &lt;a href="http://www.adjuvantonline.com"&gt;Adjuvant! Online&lt;/a&gt;, an online tool into which clinicians can enter prognostic factors of a breast cancer at the time of presentation and come up with an estimate of chances of survival and recurrence with and without treatment. This, of course, is a weakness, but, again, randomizing patients to scientific medicine or alternative medicine would be completely unethical. In the case of such questions, we scientists have to make do with whatever methodology we can; i.e., do the best we can with what we have. Unfortunately, the study was also small, only 33 patients. Even so, given the huge difficulties involved in undertaking such a study, the investigators, who, as private practitioners operating a community practice in Eugene, OR, went above and beyond the call by trying to look at their data and answer this question. That their study has a number of shortcomings is not their fault; they appear to haved done the best they could with what they had, which includes patients who underwent a panoply of alternative therapies, including coral calcium, herbal therapy, mushrooms, high dose vitamins, whey, chelation therapy, hemlock, and coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what were their findings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re summed up in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3372658901/" title="table by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3542/3372658901_e337a071f9.jpg" width="500" height="113" alt="table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that the overwhelming majority of the patients who initially refused surgical treatment for breast cancer developed disease progression. Five of these patients ultimately underwent surgical resection. Of the other 6 patients, 5 had developed metastatic disease that precluded benefit from surgery. Furthermore, the disease progression caused by the delay in surgery was associated with an increase in the estimated 10-year mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who declined chemotherapy or hormone therapy faired slightly better. Optimism for this strategy should be severely tempered by the fact that the length of follow-up evaluation in these patients was relatively short, and these patients had early stage (I or II) disease. By software estimates, the 10-year mortality rate for these patients is still expected to be more than 50% higher than it would have been if the patients had taken their recommended therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of patients who expressed their intention to pursue alternative therapies did not return for follow-up evaluation. Attempts were made to contact these patients. Those for whom follow-up evaluation was unavailable were excluded from this study. Although their omission may introduce a selection bias in the results, the effect of this bias is expected to be small because relatively few patients (14 of 47) were in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find two points important about this study. First, it confirms once again the importance of surgery as a therapeutic modality for breast cancer, especially early stage. Second, and more importantly, it strongly suggests that foregoing or delaying surgery or chemotherapy is at the very least associated with a significantly decreased chance of recurrence-free survival. The authors do note that it is impossible to tell whether this increase in mortality was solely due to delay or refusal of effective therapy or whether the modalities chosen were deleterious. My guess is that it was almost certainly due to the ineffectiveness of the alternative therapies chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More evidence of the uselessness of “alternative” medicine in breast cancer was published two years ago by Edzard Ernst, author of &lt;em&gt;Healing, Hype or Harm? A Critical Analysis of Complementary or Alternative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=375"&gt;Harriet reviewed&lt;/a&gt; about a month ago. In 2006, he wrote a review for the &lt;em&gt;Breast Journal&lt;/em&gt; along with Katja Schmidt, MSc, C Psychol, and Michael Baum, MD, ChM, a review entitled &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118632681/HTMLSTART"&gt;Complementary/Alternative Therapies for the Treatment of Breast Cancer. A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials and a Critique of Current Terminology&lt;/a&gt;. The objective of the study was to examine all studies randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for “alternative cancer cures” (ACCs). Treatments examined included various methods of psychosocial support such as group support therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive existential group therapy, a combination of muscle relaxation training and guided imagery, the Chinese herbal remedy Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, thymus extract, transfer factor, melatonin, and factor AF2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first finding was that the methodological quality of the studies was, by and large, pretty low. The most common deficiencies included: lack of power sample calculation; small sample size; lack of adequate randomization and/or (patient and assessor or only assessor) blinding; and insufficient follow-up periods. It was noted that only one trial applied an &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7211/670"&gt;intention to treat analysis&lt;/a&gt;. From the 15 studies Ernst examined, this is what was concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The totality of the data fails to show a single intervention that would be demonstrably effective as an ACC. The paucity and the often-low methodological quality of the RCTs are as unexpected to us as they are disappointing. Most trails had small sample sizes; thus a type II error is conceivable. But even if this were true, one would be correct in stating that to date, no effective ACC has been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is, of course, true based on discussions of prior plausibility alone. One could argue that, given the poor quality of the studies examined by Ernst, there might be an effect that was missed. However, if an effect were missed, it would have to be small or, at most, moderate. That is not what is claimed for many of these ACCs. What is often claimed is a near-miraculous “cure” for cancer, which, if it were true, would be relatively easy to detect. As I’ve often argued about, for example, the Gonzalez regimen for pancreatic cancer, if such ACCs really were cures, it would actually be fairly easy to show. In the case of pancreatic cancer, for instance, just producing well documented case reports of a few five year survivors among patients with documented metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas would, I daresay, make even Wally Sampson and Kimball Atwood sit up and take notice. Somehow, we never see this. Of course, what makes the question in breast cancer more difficult to answer is its highly variable natural history. In contrast, the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer die within the first year (more than half die within six months); fewer still live beyond two years; and very close to none live beyond three years. In contrast, lots of women with metastatic breast cancer live longer than two or three years; a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, about five years ago, there was a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12565991?dopt=Citation"&gt;study out of Norway&lt;/a&gt; that looked at the effect of alternative medicine on cancer survival. This study did not limit itself to breast cancer, but it is interesting and useful nonetheless. The hypothesis of the study was that the use of alternative medicine does not have any effect on the survival of cancer patients, and to test the hypothesis investigators studied data from surveys done by the Norwegian Board of Health, which asked patients standard demographic information, but then asked them about their use of alternative medicine as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the questionnaire presented to the patients, AM was defined as any treatment outside of mainstream therapy that had been used to treat their cancer. A multiple-choice list consisting of the best known and frequently used non-proven methods in Norway was presented. Patients also had the opportunity to add other types of alternative therapy in response to an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following alternative methods were described in the multiple choice questionnaire: Use of biological treatments, herbs, faith healing or healing by hand, homeopathy, reflexology (zone therapy), megadoses of vitamins, diet treatments, injection therapies such as iscador (a mistletoe preparation) and a Norwegian injection therapy called “Nitter therapy”. Nitter therapy consists of vitamin B12, gammaglobulins, tranexamic acid, multivitamins and nutritional supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modalities such as relaxation, psychotherapy, participation in a self-help group or changes in lifestyle activities that were used to reduce distress and to improve the patient’s subjective well being were not coded as AM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually very much approve of the fact that the investigators did not define relaxation, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, etc., as “alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 515 patients were analyzed, and results were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2001, survival data were obtained with a follow-up of 8 years for 515 cancer patients. A total of 112 (22%) assessable patients used AM. During the follow-up period, 350 patients died. Death rates were higher in AM users (79%) than in those who did not use AM (65%). In a Cox regression model adjusted for demographic, disease and treatment factors, the hazard ratio of death for any use of AM compared with no use was 1.30, (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99, 1.70; P=0.056), suggesting that AM use may predict a shorter survival. Sensitivity analyses strengthened the negative association between AM use and survival. AM use had the most detrimental effect in patients with an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status (PS) of 0 (hazard ratio for USE=2.32, 95% CI, 1.44, 3.74, P=0.001), when compared with an ECOG PS of 1 or higher. The use of AM seems to predict a shorter survival from cancer. The effect appears predominantly in patients with a good PS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, not surprisingly, use of alternative medicine is correlated with poorer surival in the patients with a good performance status and thus who are likely to have a more favorable prognosis. Patients with a poor performance status are more likely to undergo less aggressive therapy because they are less able to tolerate, for example, radical surgery or heavy-duty chemotherapy regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors speculated about a number of reasons why use of alternative medicine might be associated with poorer survival. Obviously, it may not be causative. (Remember again that correlation does not necessarily equal causation. One possible explanation is that users of alternative medicine are less likely to undergo optimal medical therapy. One interesting possibility is that users of alternative medicine were more likely to be having severe symptoms, which led them to turn to “alternative medicine” to try to relieve their symptoms. In any case, this study had a number of problems, including a high attrition rate that could have resulted in significant selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, I conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a significant survival benefit due to any “alternative” therapy, nor is there good evidence for significant treatment effects. The studies that do purport to show an effect are virtually all plagued with methodological difficulties and tend to show effects that are barely above background noise. Even the much touted psychosocial support of late has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=303"&gt;failed to demonstrate any improvement in the survival of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, although there is a relative paucity of studies, and they, too, are generally retrospective and difficult to interpret, what evidence is out there is that alternative medicine use among cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of dying from cancer, particularly when conventional therapy is eschewed. Taken together, these data make it very hard not to conclude that at best the vast majority of alternative therapies are either useless, no more than placebos, or might even be harmful. That is why they have no role in science-based medicine at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118632681/HTMLSTART"&gt;Edzard Ernst put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of an “alternative cancer cure” assumes that conventional oncology would not adopt a cancer treatment simply because it originates from an area outside of mainstream medicine. We feel that, should such a cure one day emerge, it would be investigated without delay by oncologists and adopted into routine care as soon as the data supporting it are convincing. Plant-based cancer medications such as Vincristin and Vinblastin (both extracted from the plant &lt;em&gt;Vinca rosea&lt;/em&gt;) or Taxol (&lt;em&gt;Taxus baccata&lt;/em&gt;) could be employed to back up this theory. It follows that the term ACC is and most likely will always be a contradiction in terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as I frequently put it: There is no such thing as “alternative” medicine. There is medicine that is effective, medicine that is not, and medicine that has not been tested yet. Nearly all of so-called “alternative” medicine falls into one of the latter two categories, and those that have not been tested yet nearly all fall into the category of being so wildly improbable that testing them without more positive evidence makes no sense. In any case, as a cancer surgeon, I don’t care where a therapy came from. I really don’t. If someone could show me that &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; or homeopathy cures cancer, I’d use either. In the meantime, I will continue to argue that the very concept of “alternative” medicine is a potentially deadly false dichotomy for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UAL, for now, has installed a large canvas of 160 square meters in a building under construction in the number 60, Avenue de Goya, including the slogan of the campaign and… also Article 20 of the Constitution, which enshrines the right to freely express and disseminate thoughts, ideas and opinions by word, writing or any other means of reproduction, and prohibits any form of prior censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this campaign with UAL… is not whether God exists or not, but to discuss whether the atheists have the same rights as believers and make visible the reality of these people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/buildingad.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/buildingad.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, the sign translates to “There’s probably no God.  Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not entirely happy with all the editing choices and think it comes off as less strong than what I originally wrote, but the main message still is conveyed. And I can’t stress enough how beneficial it is for fellow atheists and skeptics to take advantage of their local newspapers’ letter to the editor section to spread their voice, especially if you’re living in a small community. You can even go under a fake name to protect your identity if you feel it necessary. But it’s a vastly underused opportunity to speak out with an audience that’s often many thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first I’ll reprint the letter as it appears in the paper and then I’ll include the original version after that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————————————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Reprinted &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/opinion/letters/Letters_for_Sunday_March_22_2009.html?c=y&amp;amp;page=3"&gt;Letter to the Editor from The Bergen Record&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0310/p09s01-coop.html"&gt;“The coming evangelical collapse” &lt;/a&gt;(Other Views, March 12), Michael Spencer fails to grasp the root problem: the movement itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer calls the movement’s identification with the culture war and political conservatism “a costly mistake,” as if another option exists for those believing the literal truth of the Bible. But how can biblical literalists reconcile the clear anti-gay message of the Bible with gay marriage legislation and remain intellectually honest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not merely that the evangelical movement will be perceived as a threat to cultural progress, bad for America, bad for education, bad for children and bad for society. Progress in science, medicine, education, as well as human and civil rights comes out of looking forward, while evangelicals look only to the past, both to primitive Bronze Age philosophy and to a romanticized Pleasantville-like version of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer concludes that the movement’s error was in not having enough faith. The reality is the opposite. Faith motivated its adherents every step of the way. And now that Spencer appeals to reason, he’ll find a movement unwilling to listen because faith cannot be tempered by reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer melodramatically paints a future full of anti-evangelical bigotry but isn’t troubled by the bigotry perpetrated by the movement itself. But if the movement does collapse, we won’t see anti-evangelical bigotry but rather what author Sam Harris, a researcher in the neural basis of belief, calls a “conversational intolerance” of failed ideology, an intolerance of the intolerant. When analyzing what went wrong, Spencer never stopped to ask himself why the evangelical movement is worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s the original:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “The coming evangelical collapse” (Other Views, March 12), Michael Spencer predicts the imminent demise of the evangelical movement. Though I agree with many of his reasons, he fails to grasp the root problem, the movement itself.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer calls the movement’s identifying with the culture war and political conservatism “a costly mistake” as if another option exists for those believing the literal truth of The Bible. But how can biblical literalists reconcile the clear anti-gay message of The Bible with gay marriage legislation and remain intellectually honest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not merely, as Spencer argues that the evangelical movement will be perceived as a threat to cultural progress, bad for America, bad for education, bad for children and bad for society. It IS all those things by all objective and measurable standards. Progress in science, medicine, education, as well as human and civil rights comes out of looking forward, while evangelicals look only to the past, both to primitive Bronze Age philosophy and to a romanticized Pleasantville-like version of America that never really existed and which can only be remembered fondly by upper-class, heterosexual, male WASPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer concludes the movement’s error was in not having enough faith when it’s the opposite. Faith, as opposed to reason, motivated them every step of the way. And now that Spencer appeals to reason, he’ll find a movement unwilling to listen because faith cannot be tempered by reason. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer melodramatically paints a future full of anti-evangelical bigotry though isn’t troubled by the bigotry perpetrated by the &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;movement itself. But if the movement does collapse, we won’t see anti-evangelical bigotry but rather what Sam Harris calls a “conversational intolerance” of failed ideology, an intolerance of the intolerant. When analyzing what went wrong, Spencer never stopped to ask himself why the evangelical movement is worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;"For the cities which were formerly great have most of them become insignificant; and such as are at present powerful, were weak in the olden time. I shall therefore discourse equally of both, convinced that human happiness never continues long in one stay."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So writes Herodotus---called the "father of history"---in &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html"&gt;Book 1&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html"&gt;Histories&lt;/a&gt;, which recount the wars between the ancient Greeks and the Persians in the 5th century B.C.E.. Herodotus wrote his account "in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds"-----not only so that the events of the past might not be forgotten, but also so that it might be possible to figure out why those events had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he gives his explanation of how and why Greeks and Persians fought, Herodotus reaches back to the Trojan War, to myth---the Persians are said to "trace to the attack upon Troy their ancient enmity towards the Greeks"---and then launches into the story of Croesus, King of Lydia, and (reaching back a number of generations) of the kings before Croesus. Herodotus narrates how Croesus, famous for his immense wealth, went to war against the Persian Empire; before doing so, he consulted the Oracle at Delphi and was told:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Croesus attacked the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croesus marches against the Persians but the empire that is destroyed is not theirs, but his own----a change of fortunes indeed. So, to quote Herodotus' words again, have those who "were formerly great have most of them become insignificant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is the word at &lt;a href="http://www.change.org"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, which I started to write for at the time of a very big change in contemporary history, Barack Obama becoming the first African-American President of the USA. It's only been about three months that I've been blogging here and already there've been some major changes in my own life, some highs and dreadful lows. I had figured that &lt;a&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't be easy for Charlie, but I didn't think it would as &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;hard as it has been&lt;/a&gt;, or that it would come so fast and furious. It is the case that &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_prepared_criminal_justice_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;criminal justice and violence&lt;/a&gt; have been the topics of more than a few of more posts recently. For myself, if these issues are not talked about and talked about in an honest way, we can't begin to address them. I'm certainly all for strategizing how to teach my son to communicate better, to control his anxiety better, before something really difficult, and terrible, happens---just reading this story about a &lt;a href="http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/top-stories/5423229"&gt;New Zealand woman on the spectrum who was held in a police cell for three days&lt;/a&gt; makes me think, what could have been done before things got to this point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the midst of all my own worries, a new height was reached, when I found myself on an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;airplane to Greece&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, March 13th, with 15 students from my college and a colleague. The trip didn't start fortuitously: One student didn't show up in time to catch the bus to the airport and the bus driver couldn't figure out how to reach the terminal where our plane was and almost drove all the way back into Manhattan away from JFK Airport. It turned out that he only spoke Spanish and, fortunately, one student was fluent and directed him back to the terminal (where the student who had missed the bus was already waiting for us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flight lasted almost 13 hours and the fidgety, fussing four-year-old boy who we'd seen running circles in the airport was seated a few rows behind us. He couldn't sit and was in the aisles and lying down on the floor and taking off his shirt and crying loud and long and grumbles plus were heard all around me. I remembered how, last summer, &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-very-unfriendly-skies/"&gt;an autistic toddler and his mother were removed&lt;/a&gt; from an airplane and other &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/more-unfriendly-skies/"&gt;instances of not so friendly skies&lt;/a&gt; for kids on the spectrum; I remembered the time Charlie cried for four hours straight (ear trouble) when he was a baby on a flight from St. Louis to California, and when he back-arched onto me crying and weeping, and how I started not bringing a book to read on the plane because I knew I'd have my hands full keeping him occupied and a book in my bag was just extra dead weight.  So when some of my students---it had been several hours with more to go---were talking too loudly and the child's mother chided them for talking, I responded to them by saying, I'm with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I'd been the traveler with a book not understanding how parents just can't &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; a child stop crying. I'd indeed have a couple of books in my bag, and a CD player in those pre-iPod days, and I'd packed something to eat besides unpleasant airplane food. On the flight to Greece I had my guidebook and a stack of readings from Greek history, tragedy and philosophy (including Herodotus) and an iPod shuffle we'd gotten for Charlie, but that he never took to (he really needs to see a screen to view his music choices). The airlines had run out of choices for the in-flight meal and I settled for what they had, which was chicken, and I'm a vegetarian. I talked to the students, read, listened, sent sympathetic thoughts to the mom and her child and noted to a few that that mother must have been beyond exhausted and getting that desperate feeling (I remember it well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, almost 18 years ago (when some of my students were barely a year old), I'd flown to Europe with a backpack, two guidebooks (&lt;em&gt;Let's Go Europe&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/em&gt; guide), and a Eurail pass and spent over two months traveling, all on my own. As I wrote, I  &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;didn't go to Greece&lt;/a&gt; because I figured I could always go back----and, after the passing of a few more years, after Charlie was born and diagnosed, I'd realized that maybe, that very much indeed, some things are just not going to be possible. I know people don't like to hear or think that, but sometimes things just aren't and my way is not to bemoan perpetually, but to deal with what is. This has been a key strategy in us getting Charlie what he needs and, as my trip to Greece with my students unfolded, it's not a bad strategy in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our airplane landed around 8am in Athens on the morning of March the 14th and from the time we stepped outside from the &lt;a href="http://www.aia.gr/default.asp?langid=2"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, sleepiness was transformed into excitement and a fervent need to see Athens, her acropolis, and all of her sights, and into the city with its ancient ruins and so much life and traffic in the street we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History, as my resident historian frequently intones to me, is change over time, those highs that sink into lows and new lows, only to rise again when you're least expecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;And just so you know, Charlie did fabulous several times over---more about this, and our travels in Greece, in posts to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please wecome Dr. John Snyder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Snyder, M.D., is Chief of the Section of General Pediatrics and Medical Director of Pediatric Ambulatory Care at Saint Vincent’s Hospital in New York City. He is also Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at New York Medical College. Since 1994 Dr. Snyder has been active in pediatric resident and medical student education with a particular interest in evidence based pediatrics. His main area of interest is medical myth and the ways in which parents utilize information in making medical decisions for their children. One area of focus has been vaccine myth, and he lectures frequently on this subject in both academic and community settings. Dr. Snyder graduated form Mount Sinai School of Medicine and completed his residency training in pediatrics at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He is board certified in Pediatrics, and is a Fellow of The American Academy of Pediatrics. He is the founding partner of Pediatric Associates of Saint Vincents, a mutli-specialty pediatric faculty practice in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered Dr. Snyder on the HealthFraud mailing list, where, along with our very own Harriet Hall, he’s done yeoman’s work in the discussions there. Given how much the antivaccine movement has figured into the topics discussed here, I’ve also been looking for a skeptical pediatrician for quite a while now, which is why I’m very glad we’ve landed Dr. Snyder, who will be posting approximately once or twice a month. His first contribution to SBM will be posted later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please welcome him and be sure to comment on his first post, which will likely appear by Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, some people think they know exactly what they are. They're chemtrails, noxious chemicals being added to the atmosphere with the full support of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right... even the commercial jets that you fly on vacation are leaving deadly trails of weather control substances and public pacification sprays, and we're all being exposed to them constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="The recipe" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/bread-recipe-found/"&gt;JTB bread&lt;/a&gt; turned out pretty good, although it (as usual) tends to rise in the middle to form a dome-shaped loaf, no matter what type of pan it goes into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3373632233/in/photostream/"&gt;Banana Chocolate Chirpy Bread&lt;/a&gt;–basically a banana bread mix with cricket flour and chocolate chips in it.  That was also a pretty big hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are stealth entomophagy–while the odd head capsule may escape &lt;a title="Photo of cricket flour" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3372791059/"&gt;conversion into flour&lt;/a&gt;, or leg poke out of a slice, for the most part, you can’t see the insects.  It’s where most people start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3374447114/in/photostream"&gt;&lt;img title="pesto crickets" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3470/3374447114_960416d26f_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What was really surprising is how many people liked the foods I brought that &lt;strong&gt;didn’t &lt;/strong&gt;try to hide the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pesto cricket canapés went over very well!  I froze a lot of pesto last summer, and had about half a jar left over from earlier this week. I threw some crickets in, put it on bagel bites, and they were eagerly gobbled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also fried up waxworms in garlic butter, and those were very popular as well. (Served on a Triscut for a nice crunch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waxworms are kind of like insect tofu–they take on whatever flavor you cook them with.  And pretty much anything fried in garlic butter is yummy :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the usual results–I always say I’ll never do bug food again, since it is a huge hassle to cook for 50+ people, but I have so much fun I get suckered into doing it again.    We also had wonderful conversations about what is “normal” and food-animal conversion efficiency, so the basic message definitely got through!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating insects is ecologically efficient, and culturally the norm in most of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party features a live mentalism performance by Mark Edward, special guests Yau-Man Chan and Ryan Johnson, a live Skeptoid presentation, formal catered dinner &amp;amp; drinks, live music &amp;amp; entertainment, and the exclusive unveiling of the Secret Project from the Skeptoid skunkworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually, I did not see it once, I saw it twice (complicated story how that happened). Bride of Coturnix and I went alone on Friday night, and we brought the kids with us on Saturday afternoon. Which was good timing as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/leland307/statuses/1370986011" title=""&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; Topol &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/juliakm/statuses/1371900061" title=""&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/juliakm/statuses/1371044851" title=""&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; and Tevye is being &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MJKilgore/statuses/1371160074" title=""&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; by his &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ColdForged/statuses/1371529435" title=""&gt;understudy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I have to admit I am very happy that DPAC (the &lt;a href="http://www.dpacnc.com/" title=""&gt;Durham Performing Arts Center&lt;/a&gt;) is doing so well. As &lt;a href="http://myth.typepad.com/breakfast/2009/03/fiddler-historic-moving.html" title=""&gt;Breakfast with Pandora says&lt;/a&gt;, building an enormous new art and performance center at this day and age, when everyone is getting entertainment online or on TV, as well as everyone is feeling the economic pinch, was a risky and daring endeavor. We saw 'Rent' last month and 'Fiddler' twice this week, and each time the place was packed - young and old people, from all walks of life, are using this opportunity and flocking to DPAC to watch the shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I am a Web evangelist, you know I think that the main purpose for it is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/blogs_a_means_to_finding_peopl.php" title=""&gt;to find people and events&lt;/a&gt; in Real Life. The physical presence is important. The feeling of being in the same room with Topol can never be replicated online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I have to commend DPAC for fantastic organization. Having thousands of people descend on a single point in space (the one and only entrance door) in a narrow period of time is a logistical nightmare. Yet, they make it look easy - everything flows smoothly. They have many, many employees (and/or volunteers), all nice, helpful and professional, guiding the traffic around the couple of blocks of Durham, making sure everyone gets to park in one of the 3 or 4 neighborhood parking garages, and ushering people to their seats all in time for the show. And show can start at the exact time posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is always an &lt;a href="http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=337205" title=""&gt;individual with a huge-ass ego&lt;/a&gt; who thinks the theater should wait for his late Highness to arrive, and aggravating the rest of us by making the ushers open the door and shuffle him to his precious seat after the show has started and we are all already enjoying the show. There are always jerks in the world, I guess....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the show itself. It does not matter if Fiddler is &lt;a href="http://www.ginnyfromtheblog.com/2009/03/18/fiddler-on-the-roof-is-worth-seeing/" title=""&gt;new to you&lt;/a&gt;, or somewhat &lt;a href="http://mandyleighrambles.blogspot.com/2009/03/fiddler-on-roof.html" title=""&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;, or if you are total Fiddler nut &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/fizzler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;like myself&lt;/a&gt; - Topol and the crew deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am actually very glad I got to see it twice - I had two very different experiences despite the two shows being exactly the same!  The first night, I was in awe of being in the same room with Topol, totally emotional, chocking up on each number. I was also totally focused on him, treating the rest of the cast and the set as background to Topol, not really paying attention to them, thus not particularly liking them very much. The second time, I decided to sit back and enjoy myself, taking in the entire show, not just Topol. And this way I grokked how fantastic the rest of it was. OK, now for some details...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Topol. Read some more in the interviews (with slides and a short video clip of him) &lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/entertainment/stage/Topol_to_make_his_final_exit_in_Fiddler.html" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://entertainment.myncblogs.com/2009/03/19/fiddler-on-the-roof-now-playing-at-dpac/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topol is Yoda. A zen master. Calm, relaxed, yet powerful without exerting any effort to be so. In a sense, he is directing the play right there from the stage. The entire cast are veterans of various Fiddlers from around the country, actors who decided it was worth being on stage with Topol and playing second fiddle even if it meant being a "villager" instead of being Tevye (yes, some of the "villagers" were Tevyes hundreds of times before in their own theaters). There is an air of reverence towards him - they are all here to help him make the best Fiddler ever. And they are all here because they want to be - they love the play, they enjoy every minute of it: this is not 'just a job' for any of them and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have been listening to Topol on tapes and CDs of a few of his past performances, and watching the movie a number of times. I know every note and every word of Fiddler. He is almost 74. His voice is still powerful, but not as powerful as it used to be. What he never lost was the absolutely perfect sense of timing, amazing body language, and amazing ability to convey emotions through his beard-covered facial expressions (even seen from a large distance of the balcony).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tevye is an extremely taxing role. Tevye is on stage almost 100% of the time, has several long (and difficult) numbers to sing, several tough dances, and quite a lot of walking, falling, physical activity... It is not an easy role for anyone, let alone for someone of Topol's age. I have noticed that there are several points in the play where Tevye usually stands, walks or dances, but Topol, this time, is sitting on his milk-cart or a bench instead, or start out sitting and gets up about a minute later than it is usually done - they had to find good moments for him to conserve his energy so he could go through the more physically demanding moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topol is also a perfect Tevye due to his looks - he is small and skinny (even more so due to his age). Just because the first Tevye, Zero Mostel, was an enormous man, many directors make the same mistake of casting enormous actors as Tevye, and that is a mistake (only Lazar Wolf should be a big, fat guy in this play - all the rest are supposed to be perpetually hungry). When an enormous guy shows defiance, it is not surprising. When a tiny guy does the same, it is a jolt, and a display of great personal courage. When the entire village respects an enormous Tevye it feels viscerally natural, but when the village reveres a tiny, skinny guy, you are forced to think why and conclude it must be hard-earned through wisdom, wit, hard work and honesty. The message is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that comes with Topol's age is that he sings a little slower. Especially the numbers in which he sings solo or is leading, e.g., "If I were a rich man", "Sabbath Prayer", "Sunrise, Sunset", "Do you love me", "Little bird..." and "Anatevka". This slows down the entire play a little bit as the others also slow down. And this is a Good.Thing. Fiddler is not supposed to be a frantic, glitzy play (like they did &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/fizzler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;so badly&lt;/a&gt; a few years back in Raleigh). It happens in 1914 in the remote village in Russia. The time and the place! The pace of life was so much slower then. If you sit back and relax, the slower pace of the play will slow you down as well - you will notice your heart rate slowing, your blood pressure going down, and you will feel so much more relaxed as well as transported mentally and emotionally into that extinct world of old. And it has the same effect on all the actors - by slowing down, they also relax and get to enjoy their acting even more. Then they look so much more authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting my focus from Topol to the entire play made me also realize how fantastic the set design, scenography and choreography were. They are all understated - the objects on the stage are simple, the costumes traditional, the dances are not trying too hard to show off athletic performance (except in one scene where it matters - the Tevye's dream). But it is also obviously technically very sophisticated - the objects on stage move around (magnets? pulleys?) smoothly, almost hypnotically, seamlessly joining scenes that are usually jarringly separated (the orchestration, also seamlessly moving from the theme of the previous scene to the next, helps with the effect greatly). The props are cleverly designed to easily shift shapes and quickly change from one to the next. The whole show thus had this dreamlike, hypnotizing quality, never letting you wake up from it and realizing you are in the theater in Durham and not in Anatevka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the cast are all Fiddler veterans, in love with the play and obiously enjoying every moment of it (the same reason why I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/fizzler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;loved the original&lt;/a&gt; Belgrade cast). I completely disagree with the &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/front/story/1448067.html" title=""&gt;New and Observer reviewer Jim Wise&lt;/a&gt; (did he even watch the same show?) on this. These were real pros who, nonetheless, would probably have done this for free if needed, just to have fun for themselves and to be on stage with Topol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Wise hated Mary Stout as Yente. I read his review after the Friday show and before the Saturday show. On Friday I did not really pay attention to her, but on Saturday I did - and I liked her more! She was having a blast doing the role and it was obvious and infectious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way I disagree with Jim Wise is on the role of tailor Motel Komzoil (Erik Liberman). Jim gushes over him. I think he was the weakest link in the entire play. Well, Motel is usually the weakest link in almost every Fiddler I have seen or heard so far. But let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motel is probably the most complex role in Fiddler (apart from Tevye himself). During most of the first half, Motel is a meek, weak, frightened little kid. But then he stands up to Tevye, still very nervous. He persists despite getting a push-back from Tevye and eventually wins. At this moment he is completely transformed. Overwhelmed by joy for getting what he wanted most (Tseitel), surprised at his own courage, emboldened by his own victory (probably the first time in his life!), he turns, in front of our eyes, from a boy into a man. And he belts out "Miracle of Miracles" very powerfully. Then, he remains confident and assertive for the rest of the play. After his wedding to Tseitel, he is one of the patriarchs, equal with the likes of Tevye, Lazar and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casting directors constantly make the same mistake - picking the actor for the role of Motel for the first half, forgetting the second, more important half for this role. They pick a tall, skinny, lanky guy with glasses and a squeaky voice who does wonderfully well portraying the weekling boy at the beginning, but is overwhelmed by the rest of the role. It is so much easier for a powerful actor to pretend to be weak in the beginning and then transform into a strong personality, than it is for a weak actor to pretend he is really assertive and confident in the second half. With such a choice, the "Miracle of Miracles", a powerful song, sounds thin and unpersuasive. The displays of assertiveness later on look comical instead of serious. And many Motels actually play it for a comical effect, including, perhaps more than some others I've seen, Erik Liberman. He just does not take this role seriously enough and plays for laughs and giggles throughout the play. The whole effect of his transformation from boy to man is lost. After the show, Bride of Coturnix looked at me and said "You should have jumped on the stage and sung Miracle of Miracles - you do a better job with it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golde (Susan Cella), Tzeitel (Rena Strober), Hodel (Jamie Davis), Chava (Alison Walla), Lazar Wolf (Bill Nolte), Perchik (Colby Foytik) and Fyedka (Eric Van Tielen) were all very good. I have seen better in each role, but I have also seen much worse in each role as well. I certainly have no complaints about any of them - their energy and love for this play more than make up for any comparative weaknesses in, for instance, singing ability (no, don't take it wrong, they all sing well, but I have heard some more amazing singers in those roles before). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the energy is what always makes this play work, not technical perfection and singing bravures. And that energy was palpable throughout the play, making the show an unforgettable experience. Kudos to everyone involved in the play, and to DPAC for getting the show to Durham in the first place. I hope my kids will, in 20 years if not today, understand they saw history and will cherish the memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/fiddler_on_the_roof.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1nluzat3k2M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237763795304"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/22/the-physicists-killed-wall-street/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/defd87e644062cd8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Society"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">The physicists killed Wall Street</title><published>2009-03-22T22:55:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T22:55:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/22/the-physicists-killed-wall-street/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago there was an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/science/10quant.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=2&amp;amp;sq=wall%20street%20physics&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;interesting opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NYTimes about how physicists are the harbingers of doom, and are responsible for the end times. Or, more specifically, it’s because of physicists that the financial markets are in tatters all around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that greedy physicists have gone to Wall Street, cooked up all sorts of arcane derivative products, and subsequently unleashed these weapons of mass destruction on the financial markets. This sentiment is best epitomized by a statement from none other than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett"&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps the world’s most successful investor, and certainly the world’s richest): “beware of geeks bearing formulas”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/principia_title.jpg" title="Newton’s Principia (3 laws)"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/principia_title.jpg" alt="Newton’s Principia (3 laws)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Undoubtedly there is some truth underlying this sentiment, in the sense that there are plenty of (mostly lapsed) physicists working on Wall Street. And these physicists have indeed helped develop fairly mathematical and esoteric models for the markets. These models made it possible to leverage excessively (i.e., invest significantly with very little money down), and made it exceedingly difficult to evaluate risk. And it sure is convenient to find scapegoats on which to blame the global recession. But, fundamentally, the markets are in free-fall because of rampant and unfettered greed. And it turns out there was plenty of that to go around. For the last few years it was simply too easy to make huge sums of money by taking on large risk. So long as the markets went up, all was good. But when there’s the possibility to make vast sums of money, there’s an equal and opposite possibility of losing vast sums of money. Newton’s 3rd law of finance, I suppose. And this law has been much in evidence as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

But, the markedly low rate of conservation seen in the current catalogues of large non-coding transcripts (&amp;lt;5% of cases) is unprecedented and would require that each mammalian clade evolves its own distinct repertoire of non-coding transcripts. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, the data suggest that the current catalogues may consist largely of transcriptional noise&lt;/strong&gt;, with a minority of bona fide functional lincRNAs hidden amid this background.  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, whether you agree with that or not, you have to admit that the Nature paper simply does not say what Luskin quoted mined it to make it appear to say.  It actually states the opposite, namely that 95% of the transcribed sequences are not conserved (and therefore are unlikely to have function).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we have poor understanding of logical fallacies, and quote mining, from the ID camp.  In other words, nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237760683871"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_in_kenya">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f211f9b849a575a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Autism in Kenya</title><published>2009-03-22T22:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T22:13:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_in_kenya" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.disabilitykenya.org/images/pwdmanifesto1sml.jpg" alt="Kenya Disability Manifesto from http://www.disabilitykenya.org/" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Today's &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/22/MNUE16FR3B.DTL"&gt;SFGate&lt;/a&gt; has an article about individuals with autism, schizophrenia and other conditions in Africa and in Kenya in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kenya and many other African countries, poverty, lack of access and the stigma of mental disease prevent many patients from getting the help they desperately need. Despite some recent progress, just 0.01 percent of Kenya's health budget is spent on mental health, compared to around 6 percent in the U.S., for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet about a quarter of Kenyans seeking medical help have problems with mental health, says Dr. David Kiima, director of mental health. He estimates that about 10 percent of Kenya's people have mental health issues, and about 1 percent have disorders serious enough to warrant inpatient treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is worse in some other African countries such as Liberia, which suffered 15 years of brutal civil war and had numerous child soldiers. The World Health Organization says up to 85 percent of mentally ill or disabled people in the developing world never get treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edah Maina, who heads the &lt;a href="http://www.ksmh.org/"&gt;Kenya Society for the Mentally Handicapped&lt;/a&gt;, says that "'The community does not see these people as human beings. They do not see their suffering'" and &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/22/MNUE16FR3B.DTL"&gt;SFGate&lt;/a&gt; offers some wrenching accounts: Esther Nyaboke has two daughters who "display the symptoms of serious autism." When she goes out for food and water she puts them into a "baking, windowless shed and slams the door" because there's no alternative. There is only 1 psychiatrist for every 500,000 people in Kenya. While Maina's organization tries to educate people to accept their family members who have mental illnesses and other conditions, they have "forcefully taken more than 3,000 children and adults with mental illnesses or disabilities from homes where they were abused," and the abuse involves people being chained, malnourished, locked up, sexually abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenya passed a &lt;a href="http://www.disabilitykenya.org/"&gt;Disability Act&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 under which it is an offense to "conceal" or imprison the mentally ill or disabled. You can read about the &lt;a href="http://www.ksmh.org/"&gt;Kenya Society for the Mentally Handicapped&lt;/a&gt; via its &lt;a href="http://www.ksmh.org/"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; and learn more about &lt;a href="http://www.ksmh.org/inner.asp?cat=mdisabilityken"&gt;mental disability in Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;But it’s awfully embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend J. Randy Atwood &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/605328"&gt;was interviewed by The Star&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the vernal equinox last week. What he didn’t know is that they would intersperse his clear reality-based answers with those of an astrologer, who says things like this word salad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somebody who’s born at 0 degrees Aries – that’s a particularly strong Aries person … William Shatner, Captain Kirk, has kind of the ultimate Aries energy in a way: going forth, boldly going where no one has gone before, pioneering, being in command, leading intuitively. This is Aries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pssst! Hey, astrologer: Captain Kirk is a character in a made-up show. &lt;em&gt;He isn’t real&lt;/em&gt;, just like astrology. But thanks for playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what offends me more: what he’s doing to science, or what he’s doing to Trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s nothing compared to the ookiness I feel from a newspaper even giving the time of day to an astrologer, let alone elevating one to the level of expert with an actual scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

And kudos to the post for allowing his serious factual answer to an article composed entirely of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/the_global_warming_cranks_-_ge.php"&gt;crank arguments and lies&lt;/a&gt; (they also &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/20/AR2009032003191.html?sub=AR"&gt;published a rebuttal from WMO Secretary General Michel Jarraud&lt;/a&gt; dealing with the lies in Will's article)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mooney does an excellent job, and points out the frank dishonesty not just regarding the sea ice data (the only point the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/wapos_ombudsman_just_doesnt_ge.php"&gt;obtuse Ombudsman would even talk about&lt;/a&gt;), but also how every other argument in the entire article represents flawed rhetoric.  In particular I enjoyed how Mooney made an issue of the denialist tactics that were used, the cherry-picking of data, the use of inappropriate sources, etc.  His final point I agree with very strongly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this context, finding common ground will be very difficult. Perhaps the only hope involves taking a stand for a breed of journalism and commentary that is not permitted to simply say anything; that is &lt;b&gt;constrained by standards of evidence&lt;/b&gt;, rigor and reproducibility that are similar to the canons of modern science itself. 
...
Readers and commentators must learn to share some practices with scientists -- following up on sources, taking scientific knowledge seriously rather than cherry-picking misleading bits of information, and applying critical thinking to the weighing of evidence. That, in the end, is all that good science really is. It's also what good journalism and commentary alike must strive to be -- now more than ever. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't just hope people will recognize good scientific information when they hear it.  It is important that those who present the information in the media have good standards by which they evaluate scientific information, and standards for the presentation of scientific results.  The Washington Post initially failed to do so in this instance, hopefully they will evaluate Will's factual claims more rigorously in the future, and subject his sources to a greater deal of scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/george_will_controversy_now_ov.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/xwYKbUajy8g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237747154640"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3997260322376827093">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2d52efc001662a83</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Ashkenazi Jews</title><published>2009-03-22T16:09:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T18:38:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/ashkenazi-jews.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3997260322376827093/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3997260322376827093" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237742700494"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-1521285092859056089">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3a0f3166c4e030b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Philosophy of science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">How science works.</title><published>2009-03-22T14:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T15:35:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/SQ4diaRPSIo/how-science-works.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=1521285092859056089" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-science-works.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">I am exhausted by the constant necessity of defending discovery and exploration science as being as legitimate as (and, in my opinion, far more influential than) "the" scientific method of testing very focused hypotheses.

The medical model views disability as a flaw in a person that can be cured by some form of medical treatment; the social model views disability as a flaw in the way society treats a person that can be cured by some form of accommodation (e.g. the disability is caused by lack of a wheelchair ramp, not by the impairment of being unable to walk).  The medical model comes mainly out of early 20th century views about disability and medicine; the social model comes mainly as a more modern reaction to that from the disability civil rights movement.  However, there is emerging criticism of the social model from within the disability community, and questioning about its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggested new model is called the "affirmation model" in the paper &lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713661971~db=all"&gt;Towards an Affirmation Model of Disability&lt;/a&gt; (John Swain, Sally French).  The authors note that this model is exemplified by the &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityartsonline.org/?location_id=14"&gt;Disability Arts Movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key criticism of the social model presented in the paper is that it's really just a redefinition of "the problem" of disability--it redefines where the "cure" for disability is (society not medicine) but doesn't address the notion of disability as a legitimate experience, as part of culture and identity, and as something that can be positive.  The social model may reject disability as a personal tragedy, but ultimately it does nothing to directly prevent the view of disability as tragic, shameful, undesirable, or something to be distanced from a person.  From the Swain and French paper,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rejection of a tragic view and establishment of an affirmative model is far more problematic and not centrally addressed by the social model of disability.  Essentially, the social model redefines 'the problem'. Disability is not caused by impairment or a function of the individual, but the oppression of people with impairments in a disabling society. The non-tragic view of disability, however, is not about 'the problem', but about disability as a positive personal and collective identity, and disabled people leading fulfilled and satisfying lives. Whilst the social model is certainly totally incompatible with the view that disability is a personal tragedy, it can be argued that the social model has not, in itself, underpinned a non-tragedy view. First, to be a member of an oppressed group within society does not necessarily engender a non-tragedy view. There is, for instance, nothing inherently non-tragic about being denied access to buildings. Secondly, the social model disassociates impairment from disability. It, thus, leaves the possibility that even in an ideal world of full civil rights and participative citizenship for disabled people, an impairment could be seen to be a personal tragedy. There is, for instance, nothing inherently non-tragic about having legs that cannot walk or feel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an introduction by &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityartsonline.org/?location_id=18"&gt;Colin Cameron&lt;/a&gt; to a poetry anthology (Tyneside Disability Arts (1999) &lt;em&gt;Transgressions&lt;/em&gt; (Wallsend, Tyneside Disability Arts). ),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are who we are as people with impairments, and might actually feel comfortable with our lives if it wasn't for all those interfering busybodies who feel that it is their responsibility to feel sorry for us, or to find cures for us, or to manage our lives for us, or to harry us in order to make us something we are not, i.e. 'normal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affirmation model attempts to extend the social model to include disability culture and community, personal identity as shaped by disability and impairment, and personal acceptance of impairment.  To say yes, some barriers exist that we need removed in order to have full civil rights.  But also to say no, we don't want to be like the non-disabled people, we are fine with who we are as we are: our impairments are an important part of ourselves and our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the social model may be useful for identifying and removing access barriers, it may ultimately fall short of accurately modeling the experience of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237741438491"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_olympics_for_who_i">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e411b2c7012f3247</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Special Olympics: For Who?

I've been really troubled by President Obama's remark about the Special Olympics on last Thursday's Tonight Show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatting with the host, Jay Leno, the president said he had been practicing at the White House bowling alley and rolled a 129. “It was like the Special Olympics or something,” Mr. Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President has apologized, the March 20th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/us/politics/21special.html?ref=us"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; notes, but I don't think his very unfortunate remark is going to be forgotten. Sullivan at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1998"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; has commented further on the President's gaffe and also on the Special Olympics' &lt;a href="http://www.r-word.org/"&gt;media campaign&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.r-word.org/"&gt;eliminate the use&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-r-word/"&gt;r-word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid all these considerations about words which (to quote Tim Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics) can "'hurt'" and which "'do matter,'" I've been thinking about some other questions raised about the Special Olympics by Canadian journalist Lauren McKeon in an article in &lt;a href="http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2008/05/letmeplay.php"&gt;This Magazine&lt;/a&gt; (May-June 2008), &lt;a href="http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2008/05/letmeplay.php"&gt;Why won't you let me play?: Is the Special Olympics discriminating against the kids it's supposed to help?&lt;/a&gt;.  McKeon's sister, Carol, who is developmentally disabled, played soccer in &lt;a href="http://www.challengeleague.ca/"&gt;Challenge League&lt;/a&gt; in Ontario, which is "...affiliated with, but not fully integrated into, &lt;a href="http://www.specialolympics.ca/"&gt;Special Olympics Canada&lt;/a&gt; (SOC)." In Challenge League, Carol did pretty much what Jim and I hoped Charlie would learn from the numerous special needs sports leagues/programs that we attempted to enroll him in over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol found not only acceptance but friendship and a chance to simply be herself. None of her teammates cared that for that first year she was afraid to “get in the game.” They also didn’t care that some players used walkers or wheelchairs, that two or three always ran the wrong way, or that inevitably one player tried to spend the game picking dandelions or doing gymnastics. They were a team and they were having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that things were idyllic. There were bullies and more skilled athletes who, at times, could dominate the game. And the other coaches and I did spend a lot of time encouraging players to run the right way, kick the ball and stop picking flowers: next to fun, learning the fundamentals of the game and developing those skills were key. But we didn’t keep score and what seemed to matter most was that those kids who spent so much time on the outside were finally on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, we could do without the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullies_can_go_away"&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt; (we could all do without the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ben_x_and_bullying"&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;). But for Charlie (and, when I look back on my elementary school P.E. days of ducking when the ball was hit in my direction and then running as fast as I dared to find the ball I could never catch, me and all those non-sports-minded kids), sports activities that were about effort and trying and learning, about fitness and playing "for the fun of it" and "going at your own pace": These have been the best activities, where Charlie has learned the most and enjoyed himself the most. Indeed, when Charlie was 5 and playing in a Challenger League in a very suburban New Jersey suburb, his coach (whose daughter played on a "regular" little league team and whose son was on Charlie's team) noted that he preferred the Challenger League because "this is what it's about, not the competition, just going out and playing ball and having a good time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as McKeon notes, too often it seems that there's a split between &lt;a href="http://www.specialolympics.org/"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt; as providing a venue for "differently able" athletes to learn to play sports and be active, and the highest-ranked athletes who compete in the top levels of competition, and not necessarily a corresponding divying up of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the Special Olympics for?&lt;/p&gt;

It's an insidious problem, because as administrations have discovered time and again, you can cut an education budget and &lt;i&gt;nothing bad happens&lt;/i&gt;, from their perspective. The faculty get a pay freeze; we tighten our belts. The universities lose public funds; we raise tuition a little bit. A few faculty are lost to attrition, and the state decides to defer their replacement for a year or two or indefinitely; the remaining faculty scramble to cover the manpower loss. We can continue to do our jobs, but behind the scenes, the stresses simply grow and worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can testify to this from personal experience. My biology department struggles every year with the routine business of retirements and sabbatical leaves — we have absolutely no fat in this group, with every member playing an essential role in the curriculum, so every departure, even temporary ones, increases the strain. We have to frantically rearrange schedules to cover our deficits, we have to drop courses for a year (so the students have to juggle their schedules as well), and we hang by our fingernails waiting for the administration to do basic things, like approve temporary hires or allow us to do a search for replacement faculty. Since the state is contributing less and less every year, we will soon reach a point where we simply won&amp;#39;t be allowed to replace essential personnel, and then the whole system is going to break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Florida has reached that point. &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=964"&gt;The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences has been told to cut &lt;i&gt;10%&lt;/i&gt; from its budget&lt;/a&gt;. Since the biggest chunk of any university&amp;#39;s budget is salaries, that means a lot of people are going on the chopping block — and the administration has decided to simply get rid of entire departments wholesale, including geology. Think about it: a college of science that simply cuts off and throws away an entire discipline. Is that really a place that is supporting science and education? The partitions we set up with these labels are entirely arbitrary, and we are all interdependent. My own discipline of biology is dead without mathematics, chemistry, and physics, and yes, geology is part of the environment we want our students to know. Now it&amp;#39;s true that if all we aimed to do was churn out pre-meds, we could dispense with geology; heck, we could toss out all those ecologists, too, and hone ourselves down to nothing but a service department for instruction in physiology and anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we wouldn't be a university anymore. We'd be a trade school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is supposed to take some pride in its educational system — at least, we&amp;#39;re accustomed to hearing politicians stand up and brag about how our universities are the envy of the world. It&amp;#39;s a lie. We&amp;#39;re being steadily eroded away, and all that&amp;#39;s holding it up right now is the desperate struggles of the faculty within it. We&amp;#39;re at the breaking point, though, where the losses can&amp;#39;t be supported much more, and the whole edifice is going to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to do. &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=964"&gt;Write to the University of Florida administration&lt;/a&gt; and explain to them that what they're doing is debilitating, and is going to irreparably weaken the mission of the university. Unfortunately, their hands are probably tied; they've got a shrinking budget and have to cut somewhere, and they will do so, but at this point all we can do is ask them to hold off on completely destroying a scientific asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next layer of the problem is the state government. They keep seeing the educational system as a great target for saving money with budget cuts, because the effects will not be manifest for several years — and so they steadily hack and slash and chop, and the universities suffer…and now they&amp;#39;re at the point where they begin to break, &lt;i&gt;and they keep cutting&lt;/i&gt;. Write to the Florida legislature! Tell them that we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to support higher education, that as a scientific and technological nation, we are &lt;i&gt;dependent&lt;/i&gt; on a well-educated citizenry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just Florida, either — your state is blithely gutting its system of higher education, too. Minnesota, for instance, has cut investment in higher ed by 28% between 2000 and 2007, while raising tuition 68% over the same period. We haven&amp;#39;t been given less to do, either — our workload increases while salaries fail to keep up with inflation. This is happening everywhere. We are all Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the problem is…you. Why do you keep electing cretins to your legislatures who despise the &amp;quot;intellectual elite&amp;quot;, who think being smart is a sin, who are so short-sighted that they care nothing for investing in strengthening the country in ways that take ten or more years to pay off? Stop it! Your representatives should be people who &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt; education enough to commit to at least maintaining the current meager level of funding, but instead we get chains of ignoramuses who want to demolish the universities…and simultaneously want to control them to support their favorite ideological nonsense, via &amp;quot;academic freedom&amp;quot; bills. This is also a long-term goal: we have to work to restore our government to some level of sanity. It&amp;#39;s been the domain of fools and thieves for far too long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/eroding_our_intellectual_infra.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5tZ9KQ5v98Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237737356900"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/wtf_thats_all_i_have_to_say.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53a1bf1340a73255</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">WTF?

Well, not exactly. In fact the product, known as a &lt;a href="https://www.getsnuggie.com"&gt;Snuggie&lt;/a&gt;, left my scratching my head. Three questions came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who on earth is too stupid to use a blanket?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who on earth would buy a product that makes them look either like a complete dork, or a monk with a fuzzie robe?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would anyone actually go out in public with such a thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why, on a Sunday when my brain's too fried to write anything about science (or even that coherent), I was happy to see the cheap and quick blog fodder of the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h05ZQ7WHw8Y"&gt;WTF Blanket&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because you should let NASA do that for you. When &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; do it, they get to see cool stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/foBUaOKsIZM&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty nifty animation (direct links to better quality movies: &lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/img/stereoimages/movies/JupiterCOR1zm_512.mov"&gt;mov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/img/stereoimages/movies/JupiterCOR1zm_best.mov"&gt;hi res mov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/img/stereoimages/movies/JupiterCOR1zm.mpg"&gt;mpg&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/item.php?gid=1&amp;amp;id=90"&gt;NASA’s STEREO B spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, currently orbiting the Sun. It shows Jupiter, with its four big moons easily visible, as it drifts behind the Sun from the spacecraft’s viewpoint. In the animation you can actually see the motion of the moons as they orbit Jupiter, too. Plus, as a bonus, a coronal mass ejection can be seen apparently gently streaming away from the Sun. Don’t be fooled, though: that is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; blast of energy off the Sun, propelling billions of tons of plasma away from the solar surface at hundreds of thousands of kilometers per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3373734438/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3558/3373734438_f212bd64c7_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotated still from the animation.&lt;br&gt;Click to embiggen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images in the animation were taken over a 30 hour time span from March 15-16. STEREO is actually a pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 in opposite directions. They have different angles on the Sun, providing solar astrophysicists a 3D view of our nearest star. You might remember the devastating image it took of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/02/stereo-mcnaught/"&gt;Comet McNaught in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, and the utterly incredible &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/02/stereo-eclipse/"&gt;solar eclipse animation&lt;/a&gt; that was so freaking cool I put it in my &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/13/top-ten-astronomy-pictures-of-2007/"&gt;Top Ten Astronomy Pictures of 2007&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEREO has an occulting disk, literally a piece of metal that blocks the bright sunlight so that it can see the fainter wispy CMEs and normal solar corona (the dotted circle represents the size of the disk of the Sun). At the end of the animation you can see Jupiter slip behind the occulter. At some point this year, Saturn will play this same game, slipping past the Sun as seen by STEREO. I hope they catch that as well. I’m still looking for Top Ten Pictures for this year, too! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; Grammar and logic free language from being at the mercy of the tone of voice. Grammar protects us against misunderstanding the sound of an uttered name; logic protects us against what we say having double meaning. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I stared at these remarks with some astonishment.  Have you heard of the &lt;a href="http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/"&gt;Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest&lt;/a&gt; managed by the Department of English at San José State University? The one where people try to construct an opening sentence for the worst conceivable novel?  The quotation above is like the winner of a bad writing contest where the task is to construct an opening sentence for the worst conceivable book about language and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language Log could devote a thousand posts to the project of underlining and elaborating the ways in which grammar does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; protect us against misunderstanding the sound of an uttered name, and logic does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; protect us against what we say having double meaning.  Come to think of it, the thousand posts may already have been written: there are over 5,500 old posts searchable &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=001269089414569134552%3Aqvjtfauf7ou"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and already over 1,200 new ones on the present server searchable &lt;a href="http://http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenstock-Huessy left Germany in 1933 (he was ethnically Jewish, but a Christian since his teens), taught at Harvard for a while (he was a bit too religious for them, it turned out), and then went on to teach at Dartmouth College until retirement.  I don't know which of his works the above utterly-out-of-left-field quotation comes from (perhaps some learned commenter below will be able to enlighten me), but I would expect it is probably either from his book &lt;a href="http://www.argobooks.org/english/speech_and_reality.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speech and Reality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1970) or from &lt;a href="http://www.argobooks.org/english/the_origin_of_speech.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Origin of Speech&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1981).  The latter appears to be a defense of formal (i.e., public) as opposed to informal (intimate and interpersonal) language.  According to the publisher:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; Rosenstock-Huessy points out that the modern mentality has consistently preferred the informal to the formal, the abstract to the ritualistic, and numerical impartiality to personal address, and hence has forfeited the sources of a "grammatically healthy" community. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to figure out what kind of view is being summarized here, or what grammatical health might be.  I think I know what is meant by "informal" as opposed to "formal".  These terms are normally used with regard to style (or what is sometimes known as register).  &lt;i&gt;Don't you think it's kind of chilly out?&lt;/i&gt; is informal Standard English, and &lt;i&gt;Do you not believe that it is somewhat inclement outside?&lt;/i&gt; is formal. What is meant by &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;ritualistic&amp;quot; is much less clear to me.  They don&amp;#39;t seem to be mutually opposed.  Language can be abstract whether or not it is ritualized, and ritualistic regardless of its abstractness.  And as for &amp;quot;numerical impartiality&amp;quot; in opposition to &amp;quot;personal address&amp;quot;…  I admit it, I do not understand what could possibly be meant by this.  Every individual word is clear to me, but the way they are put together, the result (for me, anyway) is nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishers add, "Communication scholars and linguists concur: no other writer has approached the problem of formality in language with the fresh insights to be found in &lt;i&gt;The Origin of Speech&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;quot;  This may well be true.  I am well aware that I could obtain the book and spend a few days studying it in order to find out.  I might do that if (i) I were determined to understand everything that has ever been written about language, (ii) I had unlimited time available, and (iii) the author was not already known to have claimed that grammar protects us against misunderstanding the sound of an uttered name and logic protects us against what we say having double meaning.  As things stand, however, I am going to have to leave it to you to read the book and tell me about it.  Sorry, Rosenstock-Huessy may have been a very good man, but I can&amp;#39;t read everything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wish you good grammatical health.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Advertisements all over campus billed the lecture as “Stress, nutrition, and the GI tract,” which seemed inocuous enough. However, the lecture title as written on Bongiorno’s slide show was “Naturopathic apologetics for treating the gut.” He explained “treating the gut” to mean that for a wide variety of symptoms the naturopath’s diagnosis inevitibly focuses on the intestine and interventions nearly always involve dietary changes or supplements. Apparently some critics find this preoccupation to be excessive; hence “apologetics,” a word that connotes rational defense of articles of faith. This word choice &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;was appropriate, as the lecturer wove snippets of basic physiology, but never any direct evidence, into a just-so story about how nearly all disease is caused by the modern lifestyle and can be ameliorate with dietary intervention.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Interesting tangent: a PubMed search for “Bongiorno PB” yields one citation since his graduation from Bastyr: a Medscape letter in response to a critique of naturopathy by SBM’s Dr. Kimball Atwood. Links: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14745386"&gt;Atwood’s publication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15208553"&gt;Bongiorno’s letter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15208545"&gt;Atwood’s response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Bongiorno started the lecture with a brief description of naturopathy, which he said includes a focus on lifestyle, nutrition, exercise, spirit,  “natural medicines” like herbs and also practices such as homeopathy, acupuncture, and hydrotherapy. (These latter techniques were not discussed or even mentioned for the rest of the lecture, although they are prominent on Bongiorno’s website.) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;He described naturopathic education as similar in scope and rigor to medical school, with particular emphasis on physiology and primary care. His words: “we have a very different philosophy [from medicine]: we look for the underlying cause of disease, and we treat with the most natural way possible.” Bongiorno ended the introduction with a plea for support in his efforts to get naturopaths &lt;a href="http://nyanp.org/boardofdirectors.aspx"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; in local states as primary care physicians, which would hopefully allow them to prescribe drugs just like residency-trained, board-certified MDs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Essentially, Bongiorno’s model for disease is: chronic psychological stress causes chronic intestinal ischemia (because the sympathetic fight-or-flight response diverts blood from gut); which causes chronic intestinal inflammation; which causes decreased nutrient absoption and increased intestinal permeability; which causes leakage of “toxins, microbes, and&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;undigested food&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; macromolecules” &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;into the blood; which overloads the liver’s detoxification capacity; which leads to chemicals and toxins in the systemic circulation that are responsible for diverse diseases and symptoms. Processed foods and “chemicals” in the average American diet contribute to the “leaky gut” problem. I would not argue that &lt;a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/774566-overview"&gt;inflammed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758674-overview"&gt;ischemic&lt;/a&gt; bowels are not serious medical issues with systemic consequences. However, one got the impression from Bongiorno’s presentation that most Americans suffer from this pathology simply because we are stressed out at work and we eat fast food!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What kind of disease? Inflammation in the gut can affect cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes…I guess because those diseases also have an immune component? Poor nutrition, he claims, not only causes increased blood pressure but also is responsible for symptoms musculoskeletal, neurologic, dermatological, you name it. Furthermore, since 95% of serotonin is found in the gut, then clearly diet is important for depression and mental health, too. I wish I was exaggerating how disconnected and unsubstantiated the claims were. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Bongiorno cited several references in the middle of the presentation, and I scribbled down the citations to share them with you, dear readers, missing only one about psychiatric patients and diet. He referred to (but did not give citation for) a British study correlating heart disease with poor interpersonal relationships, presented as proof that psychological stress can lead to pathology. He cited a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/pubmed/11811077"&gt;Czech report&lt;/a&gt; of a technique to monitor gut permeability in celiac patients.  He cited a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/pubmed/9891697"&gt;10-year-old review &lt;/a&gt;with an abstract that said “One of the most significant extraintestinal manifestations of gastrointestinal diseases is rheumatologic disorders,” although bizarrely Bongiorno immediately admitted that he has “never heard of any other doc” who believes this. (I saw this exact presentation two years in a row, and last year he also said this reference was unusual. Apparently he took no time to look up another source) He cited a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18063928"&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt; of a single teenage girl whose chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms improved following dietary intervention. He cited a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16557543"&gt;Hepatology study&lt;/a&gt; of a particular type of liver disease in pregnant women that seemed associated with “leaky gut.” The haphazard structure of this paragraph represents the rapid display of unconnected abstracts that I experienced. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Is this the evidence base that informs naturopathy, or a collection of random references that seem to lend it credence? The scholarship was appalling, especially considering an audience of medical students and physicians.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I found myself getting annoyed at Bongiorno because despite his fuss over naturopaths’ supposed expertise in intestinal physiology and immunology he seemed curiously imprecise at times. I wrote in my notes at one point “he seems to conflate food allergies with intolerances,” a mistake I have come to expect from laypersons but not from physicians. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As an example, he spoke a lot about  &lt;a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose because its intestinal pathology causes systemic symptoms that respond to dietary intervention, a pattern he would apply broadly to many other diseases. I transcribed with disbelief as he said “celiac is a frank allergy to wheat.” &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=celiac+allergy+wheat"&gt;I don’t think so&lt;/a&gt;. Even if it were a slip of the tongue, such sloppiness would not be excusible from someone claiming to be a gut expert on a medical school campus. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In hindsight, I wish I had challenged him on the celiac point, to see if it was a mistake or a alternate theory of the disease. My first problem was that I felt moved to challenge points made on nearly every slide, to challenge his logic and very premises. Then a highly respected faculty member in the audience meekly asked the naturopath for more lifestyle advice, and I got so flustered that I lost the ability to say anything articulate or insightful. Challenging a sectarian in front of a sympathetic audience is difficult!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;How can we protect our gut from the ravages of anxiety-induced ischemia and processed food? Here is Bongiorno’s eight-step plan for fixing what ails you:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;De-stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Find joy in your work, have hobbies, take deep breaths often, sit with your legs uncrossed to “help the chi flow better” (this gem of a quote was the only appearance of mystical life energy during the presentation).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Chew food&lt;/strong&gt;. Each mouthful should be chewed 20 times “for best health.” A related pearl: everyone should drink at least 50 ouces of water each day.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Digestive enzymes&lt;/strong&gt;. Many Americans need to take such supplements because processed food “lacks natural enzymes.” (Another question I should have asked: If a natural food contains enzymes that digest itself, do I still need to chew it 20 times?)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Healthy food and nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;. Things to avoid: “fried foods, preservatives, sugar, chemicals, allergenic foods [because they] cause inflammation.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Remove offending foods&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are allergic or sensitive to a particular food, then avoid it. Glad we invited a naturopath to tell us this important warning.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Take probiotics&lt;/strong&gt;. He was thrilled to report that there is now evidence for this from medicine! Of course, the evidence is only for particular indications, not for general health. And in general I would prefer we wait until &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;evidence is collected to make a recommendation, rather than rejoicing when it catches up to our practice.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Sleep at least 8 hours a day&lt;/strong&gt;. This slide featured a cartoon of Homer Simpson sleeping. The presentation as a whole had far more cartoons and funny animal photos than your average medical school lecture. Call me a scrooge, but I found it annoying after a while.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;8.&lt;strong&gt; Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. A huge list of benefits, most of which seemed quite reasonable, though it felt a bit oversold to me.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banal at best. Even to the extent that some of the advice is good, did we need to invite someone who practices &lt;a href="http://innersourcehealth.com/services.html"&gt;all this woo&lt;/a&gt; to tell us that? We have a great Family Medicine department with physicians who would be happy to talk about diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management. Given our local patient population (a lot of diabetes and hypertension), our faculty drill us from day one to talk lifestyle with every patient! No chi belief required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope a more compelling case than what I saw is required before Bongiorno’s state allows naturopaths to prescribe pharmaceuticals and practice as primary care physicians. If not, then why should I waste all that time with residency and CME?&lt;/p&gt;

That's what he said...&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in so many words&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I learned from DC member Darrin at the Carrier/Craig debate that Craig said he would not debate his former students. That's what he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am now classed with a group of people, i.e., the people comprised of his former students. And Dr. Craig says he will not debate anyone in that class of people. Okay, I guess. &lt;strong&gt;But given the fact that I'm probably the only member of this class of people who wants to debate him he might as well have said: "I will not debate John W. Loftus."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've heard him say this before about former students, so it’s not really like he’s singling me out, or is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I was a student of his he said something I thought was odd at the time. This was back in 1985 at &lt;em&gt;Trinity Evangelical Divinity School&lt;/em&gt;. He said "the person I fear debating the most is a former student of mine." Keep in mind that Dr. Craig was on a High School debate team and has been debating these topics for probably just as long as I've been thinking about them. And he had only been teaching a few years before this to actually know of any student who might want to debate him. But that’s what he said. Again, he said "the person I fear debating the most is a former student of mine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He cannot deny saying this, and I don't think he will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does he really fear me? I don’t know. But just maybe he does after all. He could change his mind though. I think a lot of people would be interested in this match-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, the stated reason why he won't debate former students is that he "fears" doing so. Yep. That's what he told me when the cameras were off before the thought crossed his mind that I would want to debate him and would use his words against him. Again, he fears debating former students. That's his only word as to why he won't do it. One more time. He fears debating me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that word gets out he may have to man up, as it were, and show his followers that he isn't afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q.E.D &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-4476617203000422674?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The OED's first citation for &lt;em&gt;monkey wrench&lt;/em&gt; is 1807. The etymology is apparently unclear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[… perhaps as a folk etymology from a surname, although this is uncertain and disputed. See, for example, V. Staten &lt;em&gt;Did Monkeys invent Monkey Wrench?&lt;/em&gt; (1996) 41-3 and G. Stimpson &lt;em&gt;Bk. about Thousand Things&lt;/em&gt; (1946) 287.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surname in question is that of Charles Moncke, who is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22Charles+Moncke%22+wrench&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; (but apparently falsely?) asserted to have been a London blacksmith who invented an adjustable wrench.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237728900109"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-183762694174838094">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91e21b4dab0f7891</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="War" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Here's What Fox News Thinks of Canada's Military</title><published>2009-03-22T13:19:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T13:39:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/heres-what-fox-news-thinks-of-canadas.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/183762694174838094/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=183762694174838094" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The ignorance in this segment makes me very angry.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All animals, including humans, have an internal 24-hour clock or circadian rhythm that creates a daily oscillation of body temperature, brain activity, hormone production and metabolism. Studying mice, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Northwestern University found how the biological circadian clock mechanism communicates with processes that govern aging and metabolism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090319152210.htm" title=""&gt;Is Parenting A Joy Or A Trial?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the nation prepares to celebrate motherhood, a University of York economist is claiming that the idea that parenting makes us happy is an illusion. In an article in the latest issue of The Psychologist, Dr Nattavudh Powdthavee, of the University's Department of Economics and Related Studies, offers an explanation to one of the most surprising conclusions of recent research into wellbeing -- that having children does not increase our level of happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Romance does not have to fizzle out in long-term relationships and progress into a companionship/friendship-type love, a new study has found. Romantic love can last a lifetime and lead to happier, healthier relationships. "Many believe that romantic love is the same as passionate love," said lead researcher Bianca P. Acevedo, PhD, then at Stony Brook University (currently at University of California, Santa Barbara). "It isn't. Romantic love has the intensity, engagement and sexual chemistry that passionate love has, minus the obsessive component. Passionate or obsessive love includes feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. This kind of love helps drive the shorter relationships but not the longer ones."&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_631.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/kv2Yzxdns5Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237723675144"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=549">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/843fe93a73a1637c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="echinacea"/><category term="herbal remedies"/><category term="supplments"/><title type="html">His Royal Quackiness</title><published>2009-03-22T12:02:53Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T12:02:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=549" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have to face the reality that we live in a world where the Prince of Wales has taken up a sideline as a snakeoil salesman - no different than the traveling patent medicine hawkers who used to follow the carvinal in their mule-pulled wagon. Public psychology has not changed in a hundred - or a thousand - years. But most people think that modern regulatory agencies protect the public from patent-medicine scams. Well - they do and they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has the same problem that the US does: companies can market health products without having to first prove safety and efficacy. In the US, we have the dietary supplement health and education act (DSHEA), which allows the marketing of “supplements” (which includes herbal medicine) with “structure/function” claims without FDA preapproval. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) fills the role of the FDA, and similarly may allow health products on the market without having to provide evidence for effectiveness as long as they don’t specifically make efficacy claims in their marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases we end up with a game of whack-a-mole. Companies exploit the lax regulations and push beyond the strict legal limits. Companies marketing in the US will go beyond structure/function claims, increasingly suggesting or even outright claiming their products cure or improve diseases (a no-no under DSHEA). In the UK, companies will make health claims and fly under the radar, until there is a complaint to prompt an investigation. But more such companies and claims are cropping up than either regulatory agency can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles in 1990 created his Duchy Originals company to market snake oil, although he says it was to promote organic food and farming. He was recently criticized for marketing his &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=494"&gt;“detox tincture”&lt;/a&gt; - a combination of a quaint term with the latest scam buzzword, “detox.” The detoxification claims made for this (or any) product were scientifically meaningless. This is pure cynical marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7956378.stm"&gt;Now Prince Charles is coming under fire&lt;/a&gt; for two other products, Duchy Herbals Echina-Relief Tincture and Duchy Herbals Hyperi-Lift Tincture. The former he claimed could treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, and the latter to elevate mood. The problem was not that these claims are bogus but that he suggested they were reviewed by the MHRA, and they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The MHRA was tipped off by a complaint from a private citizen (Rob Hinkley from the UK e-mailed me this story and reports that he was the person to complain - so nice work, Rob) and has since made Duchy Originals change their advertising to remove mention of the MHRA. Here is what the&lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/echinacea_tincture.php"&gt; website for Echina-Relief&lt;/a&gt; now says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;A traditional herbal medicinal product used to relieve the symptoms of the common cold and influenza type infections based on traditional use only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the claims are now based solely on traditional use, not MHRA approval. This is a small victory - but only a very small one. In my experience, most of the public assumes that if it is on the market it was somehow reviewed and approved. The disclaimer - “based on traditional use only,” will likely go over most people’s heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a minor point, in my opinion. The more important fact is that &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18450126?ordinalpos=44&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;clinical trials have shown&lt;/a&gt; that echinacea does not work to prevent or reduce the symptoms of the common cold - it doesn’t work. So why should any company be able to sell echinacea and claim that it does? Some reply that the public can be given the scientific information and make up their own minds. However, the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18618194?ordinalpos=34&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;evidence shows&lt;/a&gt; that even after scientific evidence is made public showing that an herbal drug does not work, there is little to no effect on sales. The multi-billion dollar supplement industry is largely premised on the fact that the public does not base their buying decisions on the published scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting that the “traditional use” claim is also false. Although echinacea was used by some American Indian tribes, it was not used for the common cold. It was first marketed in the 1930s by a Swiss herbalist for the common cold, apparently after he was erroniously told that was its traditional use. But there is no evidence for traditional use of echinacea for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially the MHRA will allow Prince Charles to continue to sell snake oil with misleading claims, as long as he keeps their name out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237710480022"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_240.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0efaa6a0a6d6ecac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-22T09:01:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-22T09:01:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/d0vIp-M5to0/clock_quotes_240.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_240.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tradition is what you resort to when you don't have the time or the money to do it right. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after already receiving much criticism for that cover, they decided to use that particular issue’s cover for an advertising campaign. his has led Jerry Coyne to call for a boycott of New Scientist. I’d gladly join them if I actually ever bought New Scientist in the first place, but I don’t. So I’ll just continue to not buy the magazine. &lt;/p&gt;

It does a phenomenal job of exploring how far some evangelicals will go in their deceitful tactics to try to convert someone, which is also an interesting lesson in marketing. It also shows step by step how good people who genuinely wish to help others are misguided by cult-ish mentors into feeling that everyone around them is doomed unless converted. This is how religion poisons everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers blogged about this article too, but after discussing it, he also shares &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/evangelism_predation.php"&gt;another common born again Christian tactic to try to convert people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But I suspect that speculation will center on what the man's being on the autism spectrum might have had to do with this incident.

Heey!! Alright.. Um, OK, follow-up question, she's releasing a line of handbags,' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'As long as she gets AIDS, that's fine with me. If she could get cancer of the AIDS of the leukemia of the eyes, that would be awesome. If like, a biker could just fuck that into her skull...' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Alright, funnyman Patton Oswalt. Let's go to the Sizzler...'" &lt;br&gt;From Patton Oswalt's, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Werewolves-Lollipops-DVD-Patton-Oswalt/dp/B000RGSOM8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Werewolves and Lollipops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let me say this right up front: I fucking love stand up comedy.  Love it.  Patton Oswalt is one of the most hilarious mofos on the planet, as far as I'm concerned.  The other comics in the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Heckler-Michael-Addis/dp/B0017600EW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1237679248&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heckler&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DVD are of varying quality, but there's a lot of amazing comedic talent piled up in there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first section of the documentary deals with asshole hecklers in comedy clubs and all of the comics hate them.  Universally.  As Joe Rogan says, &lt;i&gt;"The thing about hecklers is, 100% of them are douchebags."&lt;/i&gt;  In this I totally concur.  There's not much I hate more than some drunken fuckhole screwing up a person's set.  In this way, hecklers would be akin to a painter in his or her studio doing a canvas and some random douche yelling, &lt;i&gt;"You suck! You call that impressionist?! Go die in a stairwell, Warhol!"&lt;/i&gt;  Don't fuck with an artist &lt;i&gt;while&lt;/i&gt; they're doing their art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem I have with the film is when it transitions into the second and third sections where the "hecklers" are film critic and bloggers.  One of the criticisms (especially of internet critics) is that they use pseudonyms and have no return address so their attacks can't be rebutted.  As illustrated in my opening quote, this is exactly what a lot of comics do night after night.  When Bill Hicks went after Jay Leno, it was so intense that my wife had to literally stop listening.  When Patton says that he thinks Ben Affleck and Lindsay Lohan should be dead, he's not criticizing their work, he's going after them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I'm not saying that I don't approve.  If it's funny, which it was in both the Hicks and Oswalt cases above, everything's good.  The fact that you *don't* do it to the target's face is ok, because it's your &lt;i&gt;act&lt;/i&gt;.  The critic going after the performer is part of their &lt;i&gt;act&lt;/i&gt;, as long as it's funny.  &lt;i&gt;Heckler&lt;/i&gt; had one part where some asshole was reading what people wrote about her to Paris Hilton and she looked like she wanted to cry - I actually felt sorry for her.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, everyone has bad days and if you have a shit day at work, then someone cuts you off, then you shart in your thong, and THEN some dickhole decides to make it his job to read bullshit internet troll quotes about you to your face, it's going to suck.  We know.  So either don't read the critics, tell them to fuck off if they do it to your face, or tuck your fucking vagina in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I enjoyed the film, but when Kennedy and some others started to moan about critics and bloggers, the hypocrisy was a little much at times.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

I don't think much of the Templeton; I think it's a rather devious organization that's trying to sidle in support for superstition under the guise of science. However, in this case I have to commend their choice for the nice remark he made on receiving the award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement d'Espagnat said "I feel myself deeply in accordance with the Templeton Foundation's great, guiding idea that science does shed light [on spirituality]. In my view it does so mainly by rendering unbelievable an intellectual construction claiming to yield access to the ultimate ground of things with the sole use of the simple, somewhat trivial notions everybody has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
