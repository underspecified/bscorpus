Professor Dawkins’ program that night was not specifically atheist in nature. In fact, it was largely an examination of the evidence for evolution, which, some might argue, is a departure for Dawkins. In recent years he has become better known by the general public for being an atheist than for being a scientist, so a presentation about evolution might have surprised anyone expecting a militant atheist to take the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over cocktails prior to the lecture, the conversation among the group I was with turned to the demographics of the audience. Someone raised the point that there were significantly more atheists in the crowd than skeptics; an observation that triggered a question from a group member who is fairly new to skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, skeptics are all atheists,” she said, “Aren’t atheists skeptics?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this young lady didn’t realize the liberties she had taken with the pronouncement — it’s not unusual for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to confuse the interplay of philosophies, let alone someone new to the game — nor did she realize she had tapped into a topic that cycles through rational thinking circles at seemingly regular intervals. I have been active in the promotion of critical thought and science for a number of years, and have personally seen it come up dozens of times. &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; contributor, Amy, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/10/you-don%e2%80%99t-have-to-be-a-skeptic-to-be-an-atheist/"&gt;wrote about it &lt;/a&gt;around this time last year. Just the other day, Jen posted a link in the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/10/skepchick-quickies-10-6-2/"&gt;Quickies&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://indieskeptics.com/2010/10/04/skepticism-is-to-atheism-like-car-is-to-house%E2%80%A6really/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. And my &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/10/dawkins-visits-houston/"&gt;brief review of Dawkins’ lecture&lt;/a&gt; sparked a telling, related comment from regular &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; reader, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/#comment-111339"&gt;halincoh&lt;/a&gt;, who is himself a rationalist, but not an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is, to many people, the issue isn’t confusing at all. The answers seem clear, which would belie the need to ressurect the subject periodically to slog through it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it does come up, for whatever reason, and perhaps slogging through it periodically is exactly what we should do, if for nothing else than to be thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s look at the major questions at play, and then use the &lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt; section for further discussion of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="color:#888888"&gt;Does skepticism lead to atheism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question seems easy, and it is. But the answer is rife with caveats, and so where it may be easy, it’s not simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question ”Does skepticism lead to atheism?” is ”No. Not necessarily”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this line of reasoning can quickly get muddy. But if we specify a definition for “skepticism” up front, it may help to keep things clear. We &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2009/01/what-is-skepticism/"&gt;defined skepticism&lt;/a&gt; here on these pages as essentially a method of inquiry or thought, based on gathering and evaluating evidence, used to draw conclusions about claims, phenomena, etc. Skepticism is a tool that helps us discover what is most probably true about a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we are to use that definition, if skepticism is such a tool, it’s clear that having it in our toolbox doesn’t necessarily lead to atheism any more than having a hammer leads to a house. It may be necessary to have a hammer to build a house, but the house isn’t a direct result of having the hammer. The enterprising craftsman might use the hammer for a million different things, but never use it to build a house. And likewise, the critical thinker may use skepticism for a million different things, but never use it to examine any religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no rules or requirements for how the tool, the method of skepticism, must be applied. The vast majority of people on this planet apply skepticism (to some degree) all the time, and don’t even know it. Say a man visits a used car lot and the salesperson points to a hooptie, and claims it’s in fabulous working condition. Say the prospective buyer sees that the steering wheel is nothing but a rusty pair of vise grips, the muffler has been attached with chewing gum, and the test drive consists of the lot mechanic towing the hooptie around behind his pick-up truck. Say the prospective buyer considers all these things to determine if the salesperson’s claim is true, and then buys the car anyway. The buyer has applied skepticism. He hasn’t done it very well, but he has in fact done skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, we are all capable of examining something and evaluating what we see. Yes, some may be better at it than others. Some may do it more often than others. But we can all do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we are unique, however, is in what we apply skepticism to. Now, most of you reading this no doubt apply healthy doses of skepticism to &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. But as much as we full-time skeptics want to think we are the rule, we are not. We are the exception. Most people don’t even realize there is a method of thought for determining the efficacy of claims, let alone that they sometimes use it, and that it has a name. Besides, we’re focusing on the method here and whether it leads to atheism, not the people and the various clubs and communities devoted to it. And in general, people apply the method only to those things that are important to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we point to as the big hitters to which the average person might apply skepticism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, people tend to worry about things they see as potentially dangerous to them or potentially detrimental to their well-being. So they may be more apt to apply whatever level of skepticism they can to those things. They don’t want to be a sucker, so they might be wary of anyone asking them for money. They don’t won’t to go broke, so they may consider deeply any large investment. They don’t want their kids to get hurt, so they might look far and wide to find a decent neighborhood in which to raise a family. They want to remain in good health, so they might be discerning when looking for a quality physician. They might train a critical eye on a variety of different things from which bad things can result or where they perceive a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But very few people see their own religious affiliation as dangerous, and very few find religious ideas to be a detriment to their well-being. In fact, it’s more likely that the opposite is true. Religion provides a good measure of comfort to a great many people. They like the community. They enjoy the social aspects and the fellowship. And often, they are enamored of the pageantry. In their eyes, there is no potential threat. The lifestyle is not a detriment to their well-being. So they likely don’t think much about it at all, let alone examine critically the minutia of its mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s another possibility. It’s possible for someone to apply skepticism fully to his or her religion, and either declare that the examination &lt;em&gt;supports&lt;/em&gt; their beliefs, or simply refuse to accept the conclusion that should be drawn from the examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end zone to all this is, there are religious people that apply skepticism to some things in their lives, but not their religion, and since they never apply it to religion, they remain among the faithful. Or perhaps they do apply it to their religion, and simply draw a conclusion favorable to belief. Either way, it’s clear that skepticism does not necessarily lead to atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if we tighten up the definition of skepticism to reflect the connotation informed by many of the advocates of the label “Skeptic”, if we are talking about the majority of people reading skeptical blogs and forums, and listening to skeptical podcasts, and attending skeptical conferences, if we are talking about strict views, we may have to revise the answer to the question, “Does skepticism lead to atheism?” to “Probably”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can and do use skepticism to some degree (even if it’s to a small degree), and therefore can adopt the label “Skeptic” should they so choose. But if they don’t give a hang if psychics pretend to be real, if they could care less if some yokel thinks a UFO is an alien spacecraft, or if they don’t care that there is no evidence for their deities, they could be challenged about the “Skeptic” label by those who do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we established earlier, there are no rules or requirements to how one should apply skepticism. But there seems to be an unwritten expectation by members of the club, the community, that to hold the title of “Skeptic”, one must apply skepticism well to all avenues of thought. And of course that includes religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if one applies skepticism to religion, and is sufficiently skilled to evaluate the evidence, he or she would most likely arrive at atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, since there is no evidence for any deities, since there is nothing to evaluate and no way to know one way or the other, the good critical thinker would arrive at agnosticism. But we needn’t bandy terms further. The point is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of the other side of the coin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="color:#888888"&gt;Are all atheists skeptics?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is as easy to answer as the first, but it can be no less complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question ”Are all atheists skeptics?” is ”No. Not necessarily”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we go further, we must examine one concept, if only briefly. As we mentioned before, skepticism is a tool. It’s a method of thinking and questioning. And everyone does it on occasion with some measure of skill. So if that’s true, we would have to say that ”Yes, all atheists are skeptics” — at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this question is specific to the label “Skeptic”. It does not ask whether atheists apply skepticism, but whether all atheists identify as or can be labeled as skeptics. Which brings us back to the “No. Not necessarily” answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, it may help if we don’t get stingy with our definitions. Atheism is simply an absence of theism. It’s an absence of belief in a deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism says nothing of the manner in which that absence was achieved, or even if it was achieved. The absence of belief could have been the state of the individual all along. (Skepchicks, Jen, Amy, Chelsea, and Jill have never held a belief in any deities.) Some atheists give up religion because they disagree with certain elements of the religious doctrine, or because something bad happened to them within the religion. Rebecca mentioned some such examples recently in a &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/10/the-two-best-characters-on-glee-are-atheists/"&gt;post about the TV show, &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, that’s a TV show, and the characters are fictional, but the characters are representative of real people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, where those are all valid reasons to give up religion, they are driven by a need or a desire to escape. None of them require any philosophical contemplation and reformulation. They don’t require an examination of the claims of the religion. They don’t require an evaluation of any evidence. They don’t require skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further to the point, there are any number of avowed atheists that still hold firmly to all manner of outrageous beliefs. Whether it be acupuncture, homeopathy, alien visitations, or 9/11 conspiracies, it’s obvious they have not applied any skepticism to the things that are important to them. Or if they have, they haven’t done it very well. Whatever the case, atheists like this are probably going to be swiftly challenged should they attempt to adopt the label “Skeptic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s clear that skepticism doesn’t necessarily lead to atheism, and it’s just as clear that one can be an atheist without being a skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But why all the fuss?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in addition to the ongoing confusion by newbies as we mentioned above, there have been some fairly good rationalist believers who have stepped away from promoting critical thinking because they felt somewhat ostracized by a perceived pervasive hard-line atheist attitude among the skeptic community. And for each of those that has quit, there are more that feel the same way, but who just sit quietly without rocking the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are some very good atheist rationalist who insist those who do not arrive at agnosticism are not good critical thinkers, or that they are dishonest. To them, allowing that type of thinking to persist taints an endeavor (rationality) that should be pure and exercised fully or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of those points affects me personally, but I would not dismiss either of them as trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would, however, simply remind folks that being too lax is not a good thing, but neither is walking in lockstep. And success for any group is always easier if there is cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think I’ve said enough for one post, so for now I will turn the floor over to you all. Let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286564118777"><id gr:original-id="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1105-we-dont-like-science-so-the-media-dont-talk-about-science-which-makes-us-not-like-science-which-makes-the-media-not-report-on-science-which-.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/41067eb0b247bde5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">We don't like science so the media don't talk about science which makes us not like science which makes the media not report on science which –</title><published>2010-10-07T16:43:57Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T16:43:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1105-we-dont-like-science-so-the-media-dont-talk-about-science-which-makes-us-not-like-science-which-makes-the-media-not-report-on-science-which-.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we published a story at the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-09-30/news/crist-backer-gary-kompothecras-bullies-florida-health-officials/"&gt;Miami New Times&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;linking Florida governor Charlie Crist to a father-son team of chemical castrators named Dr. Mark and David Geier. The Geiers are “anti-vax” autism researchers who believe rigorous chelation therapy, augmented with the castration drug Lupron, is an effective treatment for (some) autistic children. (That's the digest version, anyway. You may find some good background on the Geiers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/08/why_not_just_castrate_them_the_geiers_lu.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of &lt;i&gt;Respectful Insolence, &lt;/i&gt;or you may &lt;a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-09-30/news/crist-backer-gary-kompothecras-bullies-florida-health-officials/"&gt;view our own story here&lt;/a&gt;.) From all appearances, the governor's office is attempting to bend a reluctant Florida Department of Health to the Geiers' will, as the researchers seek access to the state's database of millions of confidential vaccination records. The governor's intercession comes at the request of one &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/meet-dr-gary-kampothecras-warrior-dad.html"&gt;Dr. Gary Kompothecras&lt;/a&gt;; chiropractor, anti-vaxer, Geiers supporter, and – crucially – major Crist fundraiser, with a seat on the Governor's Autism Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reprehensible, but it's not the subject of this screed. In this screed, we'd like to share what we left out of the story: Our queasy suspicion that none of the cynical shennanigans described therein would have taken place if the governor believed his constituents understood science, or had any faith in his state's media to report factually on a science story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're right, it must be said: the governor has not made an entirely unreasonable assumption. We two are skeptics, journalists, and Floridians, yet prior to researching this story we had no idea that Charlie Crist had tapped Dr. Gary Kompothecras to be on his Autism Task Force. (If it wasn't for &lt;i&gt;Respectful Insolence &lt;/i&gt;and a neuro-diversity activist of our acquaintance, we'd never have heard of Lupron, either.) And if we didn't know, what chance had the average Floridian of knowing – the one who gave up her subscription to &lt;i&gt;The Miami Herald &lt;/i&gt;three years ago and now gets her news from Drudge and HuffPo? None at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our story received a loud and enthusiastic reception from the skeptical and neuro-diversity communities, but constituted barely a blip on the radar of the mainstream media. We hope it's not mere egoism that makes us believe the reception rather proves the point about the wretched relationship between science and the press. There is, after all, a very important election coming up in the States, and the Crist-Rubio-Meek race has been one of the country's most-watched. Imagine any other situation in which a campaigning pol's name became attached to the word “castration” and the event &lt;i&gt;didn't &lt;/i&gt;cause pools of saliva to accumulate beneath the chins of the nation's talking heads. There was no drooling this time, because in order to make political grist out of the Lupron story, the talking heads would have had to dismiss the claims of the anti-vaxers and embrace the findings of “mainstream science” as unequivocally true. In other words, they would have had to take a stand on a scientific issue. &lt;i&gt;And that just isn't done.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? There are&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;after all,&lt;i&gt; some&lt;/i&gt; things that newspapers and cable news programs will treat as unequivocally true. For example: Though they cannot know for sure, news outlets from &lt;i&gt;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;have taken it on faith that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi77koTk8mc"&gt;God does &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;“hate fags,”&lt;/a&gt; no matter how voluminously the &lt;a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; may preach to the contrary. Furthermore, every news outlet is happy to report that the 9/11 Truthers are nuts; that Richard Nixon was uncommonly dishonest; that Stalin was bad and Hitler was worse; and that Lady Gaga is &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;a &lt;a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/?p=1676"&gt;world-conquering Manchurian Candidate&lt;/a&gt; singing in the service of the subterranean reptilian Illuminati. There are those who disagree with such sentiments, yet the media feel no need to offer “balance” (how we loathe the word) by giving these contrarians a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is much more tentative on vaccines&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;autism in particular, and on alt-med or science in general. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own (hopelessly circumscribed) experience leads us to finger four particular culprits for the media's science-indifference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. If it bleeds, it leads. &lt;/b&gt;Yes, it does, and the front page's natural preference for the loud and the splashy  does lead to an over-reporting of woo-stories and an under-reporting of skeptical stories. “Angel Rescues Trapped Miners” is news, whereas “Angel &lt;i&gt;Fails&lt;/i&gt; To Rescue Trapped Miners” is just kind of depressing. Still, though – &lt;i&gt;science &lt;/i&gt;is full of loud and splashy stories. “Castration” is a loud and splashy word! Moreover, science deals with such tantalizing subjects as the end of the universe, sexuality, cancer, cybernetics, AI, life extension, weaponry, and love. If reporters were as obsessed with drama, excitement, screamy-headline-type stories as we suppose, science journalism would be a much bigger deal than it is. But journalists, we suspect, have a difficult time contextualizing scientific data, because their brains have been subtly poisoned by a very bad idea. &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Objectivity is a false god. &lt;/b&gt;Yes, it is. Modern journalism is an American invention of very recent vintage, and newspaper writing prior to the American Civil War was floridly and nakedly partisan. The enormity of the war led to an increasingly somber and clinical tone among news writers, even as advances in telegraph technology led to a surplus of news and a resultant shortage of paper. By the early 1900s, the flat, info-packed style of American newswriting existed in more-or-less its present form, though “objectivity” wasn't yet its stated goal. That came in the following decades, as the result of arguments within academia and internecine conflicts within individual dailies. Those in favor of pure objectivity won the day (or at least a plurality of advertisers), and now most newsfolk think “objectivity” was something handed down on Sinai. It wasn't. But even if it was, it wouldn't be any more attainable. What gets printed or aired in a news story has everything to do with which sources get back to a reporter before deadline, who looks best on camera, and what angle might make a story juiciest and thereby more appealing to an editor. (This last applies mostly to television media, though we print people are not entirely juice-resistant.) That said, objectivity is a fine goal – as long as a reporter actually &lt;i&gt;thinks &lt;/i&gt;about it. But we tend not to. Consider the slogan “Fair &amp;amp; Balanced.” It&amp;#39;s popular, but meaningless. “Fairness” is telling the truth; “balance” is undermining every truth with an equal and opposite untruth. Reporters are distressingly committed to the latter, unless the untruth in question is so obviously ridiculous as to be beneath mention. This is the case with the ideology of the Westboro Baptist Church and the suggestion that Lady Gaga is a Freemasonic cyborg. You&amp;#39;d think the notion of a link between, say, vaccines and autism would be in this category as well, but it&amp;#39;s not. And that&amp;#39;s because: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Journalists don't know much about science. &lt;/b&gt;True. The scientists have graphs. The anti-vaxers have graphs. The scientists sound a little saner, but how can a poor, bedeadlined journalist be sure? He can't.  And so he plays it safe, offering up nice, balanced stories like &lt;a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-08-10/health/fl-autism-treatment-20100803_1_castration-drug-lupron-therapy-autism-therapy"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which secretes several good points amid several bad ones, trusting in the readers' scientific expertise to sift the one from the other. Similarly written pieces are likely to be published for a while, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Journalists don't think science is cool. &lt;/b&gt;True. Remember the flap about the Virginia Heffernan article in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/magazine/01FOB-medium-t.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? In that article, Heffernan launched a nasty attack on the good folk of ScienceBlogs.com while fruitlessly namechecking a few post-structuralists from the last century, as though Darwinism was a mere social construct but Derrida was channeling God. (And as though the spiteful polemic was a weapon solely licensed to journos. No &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; allowed!) Defending herself in the comments section of a &lt;a href="http://www.neuronculture.com/http:/www.neuronculture.com/archives/for-virginia-hefferman-readers-some-contexst-on-the-scienceblogs-pepsi-fizz"&gt;colleague's blog&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia excused one of her errors on the grounds that she “has no training” in science, and was so unaware of the existence of climate change “denialism” that she failed to recognize denialist literature when she saw it. She claimed this even though her screed was, in part, &lt;i&gt;a strident argument against strident arguments against climate change denialism. &lt;/i&gt;The substance of those arguments aside, we hope you'll agree with this assessment: If Ms. Heffernan had been writing about literature, politics, food, or sports, she wouldn't have felt nearly so comfortable claiming ignorance as a defense. Only when writing about science, apparently, may journalists write before bothering to learn anything about their subject. Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1997447,00.html"&gt;Nancy Gibbs'&lt;/a&gt; story from a June issue of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;, in which she editorialized about synthetic biology while acknowledging in the first graf that she needed the phrase “synthetic biology” defined for her before she could write about it. Does that inspire your confidence? (In the same story, Gibbs tentatively suggests that we avoid manufacturing bacteria, as bacteria can mutate in unexpected ways. She never gets around to explaining why this isn't equally true of the bacteria in her own small intestine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan often opined that understanding science isn't as difficult as lay people imagine. Consider the complicated data syntheses occurring within the brains of rabid NFL or FIFA-fans – that's hardly less complicated than the attainment of an amateur-level grasp of physics or biology. It's certainly a good deal &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; complex than a basic understanding of the hows and whys of critical thought. But just because journalists &lt;i&gt;could &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;should &lt;/i&gt;learn science doesn't mean they will. They're busy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We submit that the only way to create a science-literate press is by hitting journalists where it hurts: In their egos. At a recent lecture in Gotheburg, in Sweden, James Randi was asked by an audient: “What would be the best suggestion you have to us in Sweden to do something about the media's problem?” His response is applicable well beyond Sweden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Complain! It works, folks. When you see something absolutely non-sensical on television, write a formal letter with your address and your telephone number expressing how displeased you are. [Write a letter] saying that you're &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;stupid, and you &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;want to be treated like a little child. Say: I'm a citizen of the moden age! Don't drag me back into medieval times.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right on. If the skeptical community was to use its considerable erudition to issue an &lt;i&gt;en masse &lt;/i&gt;challenge to the media, we think it likely that the media would respond. Journalists don't want to be wrong, and they pride themselves on their skepticism. Indeed, it was a naturally skeptical bent that led  most of them to journalism in the first place. Journalists, especially investigative reporters, are individuals almost pathologically suspicious that they are being lied to by the rich, the powerful, and the cynical. They can sniff a dissembler from miles away, and take a visceral pleasure in the exposure of fraud and hypocrisy. Not a gullible bunch. They could and should be our closest allies.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Brandon K.

The researchers recruited 16 Zurich men from a local fan club, telling them they would be involved in a comparison of brain activity while (a) watching soccer and (b) feeling pain. Before the experiment, the volunteers filled out forms (including a &amp;quot;Sport Spectator Identification Scale&amp;quot; and an assessment about how they felt about the other guys in the room) as they sat with another supporter of their team and two fans of its main rival.

Then one of the rival fans peeled off (ostensibly for another experiment), and the &amp;quot;pain electrodes&amp;quot; came out.  The volunteer, now placed in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, had to decide which of the other two men in the room (a fellow fan and a rival fan) would get a painful shock. In addition, he was given some choices about how to treat the other two (who were actually students working with the experimenter).  The real volunteer&amp;#39;s options were, first, help out the victim by agreeing to take half of his electrical shock; second, forget about the other guy and watch a video (of soccer, of course) while the victim got zapped; third, refuse to help but actually watch the other man suffer pain. Each participant did this nine times.

That makes for 144 separate decisions about whether to help a fellow human being—and which fellow human to assist. On average, each fan offered to help a fellow fan significantly (not hugely, but still significantly) more than he offered to help a rival fan. (You might be happy to know that the &amp;quot;watch him suffer&amp;quot; option was picked only nine times, too few for much statistical analysis.)

By the way, the MRI scans found that higher-than-background activity in a region called the anterior insula, triggered by watching a fellow-fan suffer, were correlated with the decision to help. On the other hand, not helping the outgroup member correlated with activity in another region, the nucleus accumbens. What led to Hein et al.&amp;#39;s interest in these regions? The insula has been found to spark up when people watch others in pain, while the nucleus accumbens was active in this experiment when people watched cheaters being punished.

As I mentioned a few months ago, a Chinese team last year found that reactions to others&amp;#39; pain in another brain region, the anterior cingulate cortex, was also affected by Us-Them perceptions (the 33 students in that study responded more strongly to films of Chinese in pain than of non-Chinese).  And this study found that people&amp;#39;s unconscious brain response to simple motions in others also varied according to whether the others were of the same race.

In using sports fandom as the &amp;quot;Us-Them&amp;quot; dividing line, this new paper is a reminder that race and ethnicity aren&amp;#39;t special. People divide themselves up in countless ways, and any one of them can get you zapped or worse.

The largest ever survey of Americans’ sexual behavior, published on October 4 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (JSM), showed that more adolescents are abstaining from sex, while a large percentage of baby boomers are sexually active. This soothes our fears of sexually inactive old age, but the bad news is that a majority of those over 50 don’t use condoms when having sex with dates or casual acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, 31% of females and 40% of males reported having had sex by the age of 17, down from 49% of females and 46% of males in 2002. Of those sexually active teens, a larger percentage reports having protected sex — 80% of males and 69% of females reported using a condom during their last sexual encounter. Baby boomers, on the other hand, are having more sex into old age, but among those over 50, a majority reported having unprotected casual sex (91% of men over 50 said they didn’t use condoms when having sex with a casual acquaintance, and 70% didn’t use condoms when having sex with someone they’d just met).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear phone books: Sorry, but we don’t need you anymore, thanks to this new fad called the World Wide Web. Yet phone companies keep dropping you off — it’s like they think if they stop delivering you, the world will know that landlines are nearing obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;One innovator used 7,000 &lt;a href="http://inhabitat.com/2010/10/07/amazing-building-made-from-7000-recycled-phone-books/"&gt;discarded phone books&lt;/a&gt; to build an actual house. The books are so dense that you can even screw wood into them, which allowed for the building’s impressive facade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;Do you think phone books are wasteful and should stop getting made, or do you still use one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of factors that can lead to cooking dread: Miniscule kitchen, lack of inspiration, crumbling Ikea cookware (sigh). And we’re still using the plastic mixing bowls we bought back in college even though they’re cracked, because we can’t bear the thought of them languishing in a landfill for all eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re into this five-piece mixing bowl set from Melaboo. Made from 100% biodegradable bamboo fibers, these rainbow-hued mixing bowls are sustainable and non-toxic. Good for a variety of uses from preparation to serving, you can own this set for $35. Your kitchen (and the environment) will thank you for it later. Now, does anyone want a 15-year-old set of chipped bowls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post on acupuncture, I noted that the University of Maryland offered reflexology along with other supplements, and complementary and alternative medicine (SCAMs). I was uncertain as to the particulars of this SCAM, and this post is a result of those investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although messy in reality, science is a tool that gives us an idea as to how the real world functions. People will observe some aspect of nature, often for a lifetime, and from those observations discover a pattern in the data. Tycho Brahe spent a life carefully measuring the orbits of the planets; the data was used later by Kepler to determine that the planets orbit in an ellipse with the sun at one of the foci. If you have knowledge of the history of science, you realize what an amazing feat this represents, both in the measurement of the orbits and the analysis of the data. Careful observation, analysis of the data, then conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to SCAMs, where so many of the interventions are discovered by revelation, and then developed independently of data and observation. Palmer and chiropractic, von Peczely and iridology, Usui and reiki are examples. These geniuses discovered aspects of existence unseen by anyone before or after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In that time honored pantheon is Dr. William Fitzgerald who, at the turn of the last century, “discovered” that the human body is divided into 10 longitudinal energy zones that end in the hands and the feet. By massaging these zones, you could heal disease and alter bodily functions. These are reminiscent of the meridians of acupuncture, and will soon be illustrated in the &lt;cite&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/cite&gt; (see posts Aug &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6485"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). Fitzgerald named it Zone Therapy, and it went by that name until the 1960′s, when Eunice Ingham decided that, since all the energy zones ended in the feet, that it was the terminus of the energy zones that was the important aspect of Zone Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body, it turns out, is far more crowded that we could ever have expected from our understanding of gross anatomy and histology. There is so much packed into our bag of meat, I am surprised that we do not explode, although perhaps we do have a potential explanation for spontaneous human combustion: the friction of all the projections and energy channels described by various SCAM’s rubbing together in a tight space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the map projected on the iris with iridology, the maps on the ear, the tongue, the head, the hand, and the feet of the various acupuncture styles. There are the meridians of acupuncture and zone therapy, the energy flows of reiki and chiropractic. And there is the map of the body projected onto the feet and hands by reflexologists. The feet must be particularly crowded as the maps for foot acupuncture are different than the maps for reflexology; no wonder my feet ache at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflexologists are of the opinion that by manipulating the feet, hands and/or ears that correspond to body parts they can induce changes in those body parts. Touch the liver zone on the foot, alter the liver in the abdomen. Alexander Pushkin could vouch for the veracity of a subset of those interventions. Others are of the opinion that the manipulation of the feet, hands and/or ears alters the qi balance in the patient. However, as the &lt;a href="http://www.reflexology-usa.org/articles/definitions_of_reflexology.html"&gt;Reflexology Association of American&lt;/a&gt; notes, “no one definition that will work in all situations and yet, because of the multi dimensional affect [sic] of Reflexology, all are true at [sic] defining the work we do. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is true, these definitions are limiting, as they do not encompass … well, let’s be nice and call them the &lt;a href="http://www.reflexology.net/about.htm"&gt;curious concepts describing reflexology&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the nerves is to carry messages and instruct the body. When the nerves improve that instruct the body, the instruction has to improve, the body has to improve. Every nerve in the body begins and ends in the hands and feet. By applying this specialized exercise pressure on the foot, the outcome is improved instruction to each and every part of the body, resulting in a re-educating, a re-patterning, and a re-conditioning of the nerves&amp;amp; instruction through the reflex/neutral electrical system of the body…also every lymphatic vessel begins and ends in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hands and feet are crowded indeed. Safe to say that the basic premises of reflexology have no bearing in reality. There are not projections of the body onto the hands and feet. As I have mentioned in the past, when I was a child I thought the Broadway in Portland was the same Broadway in New York and that if I kept walking I would end up on the Great White Way. It is true, in a way, that the two Broadways are connected in the same way that the nerves in the foot are connected to the liver, but it takes more links to get from one to the other than to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon"&gt;get to Kevin Bacon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can reflexologist treat? Near about anything; it depends only on the claim of the reflexologist. Like many SCAMs, reflexology can help &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; illnesses. I would not deny that it is relaxing and pleasant to have one’s feet massaged — er, reflexed?  (Reflexologist emphasize they are not doing massage.) But does reflexology have any real effects on any pathological states? Besides sore feet? And, while we are on the topic, why doesn’t walking have the same effect as reflexology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflexology has been tested in clinical trials. Here is an issue that really gripes my cookies, or maybe a severe case of jealousy re: alt med.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of infectious disease, getting to test an intervention for human use is a long process. First they have to find a potential antibiotic, discover the chemical structure and mechanism of action. Then the antibiotic is tested against numerous strains of hundreds of pathogens to see if it works in the test tube. Then there are a variety of animal studies looking for safety and efficacy. Then graduated clinical trials, phase 1, phase 2, and, finally, phase 3, before the antibiotic is declared non-inferior to vancomycin in human soft tissue infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflexology, and all other alt med interventions, bypass all these steps and go straight to clinical trials. Someone can pull a therapeutic intervention out of, well, this is the SBM blog, let’s say thin air, yeah, thin air. They can pull an intervention out of thin air and the next thing you know, good money is being spent to see if it is effective, when, evaluating it on the basis of reality, it should have the same chance of being effective as more common substances found in, well, ‘thin air.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ignoring the fact there is no reason to test the efficacy of reflexology, what has reflexology been found to be effective in treating? Almost nothing of note. It is not effective for &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/190746"&gt;post operative cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, head ache, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1509577"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, post operative pain, cancer anxiety, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1314196/?tool=pubmed"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, pregnancy edema, low back pain, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565520)"&gt;ovulation&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple sclerosis. It seemed to help &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8233263"&gt;pre-menstrual syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — so says the abstract which, I’m sure, accurately represents an unbiased and flawless experiment — but it did not even seem to help &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12269681"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a hodgepodge of diseases. I thought aspirin was the wonder drug that worked wonders. The alleged near universality of reflexology, and other alt med interventions, is staggering. Imagine an antibiotic that not only treated all viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites but also infertility, headache, dementia and post op pain. Only alternative interventions have that kind of power. I am stuck looking for the underlying cause of a disease and targeting it with a specific intervention. How Western and reductionist of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While almost all individual studies show no benefit of reflexology, what would a systematic review reveal? The &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740047"&gt;summation of nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately, does not lead to validation of reflexology. Put all the small piles of nonsense together, you get one big pile of nonsense. The studies of reflexology are poorly done, with small sample size, and, not mentioned in the review, had no reason to be done in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19906525"&gt;Studies in breast cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; suggest to me that human contact is what it important, not the specific modality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three women were randomized 6 weeks post-breast surgery to self-initiated support (SIS) (comparator intervention), SIS plus reflexology, or SIS plus scalp massage (control for physical and social contact). Reflexology and massage comprised eight sessions at weekly intervals. The primary end-point was 18 weeks post surgery; the primary outcome measure was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-B) – breast cancer version. The secondary end-point was 24 weeks post surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Mood Rating Scale (MRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: At primary end-point, massage, but not reflexology, was significantly better than SIS on the TOI. Reflexology and massage were both better than SIS for MRS relaxation. Massage was better than reflexology and SIS for MRS easygoingness. At secondary end-point, reflexology, but not massage, was better than SIS on the TOI and MRS relaxation. There were no significant differences between reflexology or massage. There were no significant between group differences in HADS anxiety and depression. Self-reported use of out of study complementary therapies indicated that this was unlikely to have a significant effect on findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10660924"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…significant decrease in anxiety observed in this sample of patients with breast and lung cancer following foot reflexology suggests that this may be a self-care approach to decrease anxiety in this patient population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18370580"&gt;demented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that when receiving the reflexology treatment condition, as compared to the control condition, the residents demonstrated significant reduction in observed pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All groups whose underlying disease leads to less human contact. Have you hugged your demented, cancerous nursing home patient today? I didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monkeys, and other animals, groom each other often with a marked reduction in stress. Touch is good, and one doesn’t need to wrap it up in pseudoscientific nonsense for it to beneficial. Well, maybe you do. Strange people offering to massage your feet because it feels good may be off-putting for some and could lead to the authorities being involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doesn’t need the woo of reflexology (projected maps and altered qi) to recognize that people need and benefit from physical interactions. Like in the NEJM recently, demonstrating the tai chi was of benefit in fibromyalgia. Exercise helps fibromyalgia, and tai chi is a gentle form of exercise, so it’s no surprise tai chi was of benefit; so is yoga. The mystical magic adds nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, no one seems to have tested reflexology as an intervention for foot pain, a common complaint, and reflexology could not &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14556770"&gt;decrease foot edema in pregnant females&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders, if reflexology can’t even help a foot problem, what good is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1314196/?tool=pubmed"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; study concludes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to conclude with a note of caution. Although the results of this study are quite clear, they should not be used to dismiss reflexology as a treatment option across the board, nor indeed to argue against the effectiveness of CAM as a whole. The simple fact is that we know very little about the effectiveness of very many treatment options in relation to very many conditions. Reflexology in particular remains not just under-researched but almost unresearched, something that is quite startling given the extent of its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat mirrored in the systemic review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the paucity and the poor quality of the existing studies prevents definitive judgement about the value of reflexology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, technically, that’s true. But there is more than sufficient understanding about the workings of the human body to render a definitive judgement on reflexology. It won’t work because it can’t work, in much the same way that we know that a perpetual motion machine won’t work because it can’t work.  And yet people keep inventing perpetual motion machines. Just because the rules of the universe say something is impossible doesn’t stop them from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of studies demonstrate reflexology had no effects that could not be replicated by beyond picking fleas off your mate (am I over sharing?). And it has no anatomic or physiologic justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I was at a conference and one of my attendings was being detailed about a new antibiotic. The rep concluded with “and it’s very popular in Europe” to which my attending responded “so was fascism” and strolled off. Popularity is not a good justification to spending money and wasting patient’s limited time with nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Crislip</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Science-Based Medicine</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286555756646"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/?p=1798">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b3de29a2f8d2e2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Nerds, rise up!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/10/wmap-starfield1.jpg" alt="wmap-starfield" title="wmap-starfield" width="320" height="339"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WMAP has been a triumph of observational cosmology. It has strengthened the case for cosmic acceleration, one of nature’s most mysterious phenomena; measured the composition of the universe, teaching us about dark matter and dark energy; observed the polarization signal, telling us about reionization; provided results consistent with an inflationary origin for the universe, while constraining and even ruling out some of the simplest models; and has left us with some intriguing open questions of its own. To those of us in the field, it seems like only yesterday that we were eagerly awaiting the first 3-year data release from WMAP. Now, the final data, collected on August 20, will form part of the complete 9-year dataset, capping a remarkable decade of cosmic discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a fundamental physics perspective, WMAP is a crucial component of increasingly accurate cosmological observations that challenge the standard model of particle physics. In accurately determining the dark matter abundance, it has specified even more precisely the requirements of the new particle physics required to account for that portion of the energy budget. If dark matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), for example, the range of properties they might have is more tightly constrained. In supporting the case for cosmic acceleration, it has sharpened the need for a fundamental explanation for the size of the cosmological constant and possibly for entirely new physics, such as dark energy or a modification of General Relativity. In providing a measurement of the baryon content of the universe in agreement with that required for successful primordial nucleosynthesis, it has further underscored the need for an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, some proposals for which will be tested at the &lt;a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/"&gt;Large Hadron Collider (LHC)&lt;/a&gt;. And in its precise measurements of the spectral index of the temperature fluctuations, it has constrained existing and newly-proposed models for the physics of the very early universe, requiring an almost scale-invariant spectrum, with specific small deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to miss WMAP, but we’re not standing still – cosmologists are a very forward looking bunch for people whose lives revolve around what happened so far in the past. A host of new projects are coming, and in the microwave field the big one is the &lt;a href="http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=PLANCK"&gt;Planck satellite&lt;/a&gt;, already taking eagerly awaited data. So goodbye WMAP, and thanks! Now, what’s next? We’re hungry for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We could really do with your help on this one. PeTA and Camille's loons have the bit between their teeth and are getting quite a lot of traction in the local press and the web from their lies and distortions regarding Primate Products, and their campaign seems to have gained quite a lot of momentum. While most of Primate Product's clients have stood firm the pressure is only going to grow, &lt;a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/drugmonkey/2010/10/07/consider-the-source-ed-silverman/"&gt;as DrugMonkey's post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; indicates.

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Please read] Allyson's post (see &lt;a href="http://speakingofresearch.com/2010/10/07/speaking-up-confronting-misrepresentation/"&gt;Confronting Misrepresentation&lt;/a&gt;) .  We need to teach organizations like Primate Products Inc and the University of Florida that they need to engage more with the public, and that there are those out there willing to support them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please help us if you can, you and your readers could help to turn things around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bit of background, photos of injured monkeys from a Florida company called &lt;a href="http://www.primateproducts.com/home.php"&gt;Primate Products&lt;/a&gt; were &amp;quot;leaked&amp;quot; to the media.  The photos show monkeys with injuries and were taken by company veterinarians to document the medical care they were receiving  But, you should absolutely go read Allyson&amp;#39;s post.  Her analysis is spot on, especially with regards to the misrepresentation of events.  As Allyson writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Examples of misleading coverage of animal research presented publicly without 
essential background, context, or explanation from sources within the animal 
research community abound. More often than not, these stories are shaped 
primarily by animal activists who are unconstrained by desire to provide 
accurate information...  Also notable in these stories is that 
not only do they rarely receive full consideration of all of the facts, but they 
also are rarely matched by widespread coverage when the results are in from the 
federal agency investigations that &lt;a href="http://www.all-creatures.org/saen/press-20100830.html"&gt;activists typically call&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;warning: AR extremist site&amp;gt; 
for in their press releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made me think of my recent foray into the realm of anaphylaxis.  If you walked into an emergency room and took a picture, without context or a base of knowledge from which to evaluate the photo, any number of horrendous stories could be concocted around the photo and sold to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Emergency-room-nurse.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Emergency-room-nurse.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="350" height="273"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airforce.com/i/careers_page/Emergency-room-nurse.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;:  In this picture, an evil torturer drips an acid into the eyes of a restrained subject for her own pleasure and enjoyment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people would look at the above picture though and immediately call &amp;quot;bullshit&amp;quot; on its caption.  But, that&amp;#39;s because most of us have sufficient experience to accurately evaluate the image.  Most of the general public does not have the experience to evaluate animal images in the media, and that&amp;#39;s why the responsible evaluation by experts is so important.  Again, Allyson writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the case of the Florida facility, the federal 
agency &lt;a href="http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/research-regulation/"&gt;charged with oversight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome"&gt;United States 
Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, has performed an investigation in response to the 
photographs made public by activists.  The results of the USDA focused 
inspection regarding the allegations were &amp;quot;No non-compliant items identified 
during this inspection.&amp;quot;  In addition, the National Institutes of Health Office 
of Laboratory Animal Welfare wrote a letter of agreement saying it &amp;quot;finds the 
institution to operating in accordance with the provisions of the PHS Policy on 
Humane Care and use of Laboratory Animals&amp;quot;.  When the reports are made publicly 
available SR will post them here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Although company officials have not yet commented publicly, the USDA report 
makes it clear that many of the allegations and speculation about the Florida 
company that were offered to the media and via extremist websites by various 
activist groups are untrue.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.speakingofresearch.com/"&gt;Speaking of Research&lt;/a&gt; does not expect that the activist groups 
that have promoted this story will provide coverage of the USDA report that 
shows their claims have no basis. Nor do we expect that they will discuss the 
real conclusion, which is that socially-housed monkeys engaged in behavior that 
is not uncommon for primates and hurt each other. In truth, many activists are 
not interested in the USDA's conclusions, or in whether laboratory animals are 
socially or individually housed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it is so important for those of us with an audience to publicize these findings.  Both the USDA and the National Institutes of Health have found no evidence of neglect.  Animals shown in the photo were receiving medical attention for the types of injuries they might display in the wild.  Yet, the loudest voices are always the most extreme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there is no reason that our voices can&amp;#39;t also be loud.  Head over to &lt;a href="http://speakingofresearch.com/2010/10/07/speaking-up-confronting-misrepresentation/"&gt;Speaking of Research&lt;/a&gt; and offer your support.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/10/a_picture_may_be_worth_1000_wo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/Y7569ijEnT8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286554073426"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/friday_cephalopod_oh_for_cute.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2145127063b4395f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Oh, for cute!</title><published>2010-10-08T15:28:13Z</published><updated>2010-10-08T15:28:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pLMttMDAjcM/friday_cephalopod_oh_for_cute.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/friday_cephalopod_oh_for_cute.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/10/friday_cephalopod_oh_for_cute/loligo.jpeg" width="500" height="389" alt="loligo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Loligo plei&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They are not allowed to have magazines, newspapers, or any other type of books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thought: I'd die if I were arrested in Berkeley County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second thought: it says something about the county that they&amp;#39;ve had this policy for years, and are only now moving on one complaint made in 2008. The comments section on the article is enlightening, too — apparently, prisoners ought to be digging ditches, not reading, and if we let them read magazines, next thing you know they&amp;#39;ll be demanding vacations in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's a snapshot of the South Carolina citizenry's views on this issue. The numbers might change soon, though, as a more enlightened world intrudes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should prisoners be able to read whatever they want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes 22%&lt;br&gt;
No 66%&lt;br&gt;
It depends on the crime. 11%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/should_an_online_poll_determin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/PedFIYtsxWc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286553782056"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=12980">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/544c8110bf88ea9b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conservation"/><category term="Culture"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Energy"/><category term="Food"/><category term="Media and Science"/><category term="energy in food"/><category term="healthy eating"/><category term="Michael Webber"/><category term="science friday"/><title type="html">Michael Webber on SciFri</title><published>2010-10-08T16:02:34Z</published><updated>2010-10-08T16:02:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/10/08/michael-webber-on-scifri/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webberenergygroup.com/people/bio"&gt;&lt;img title="clip_image002" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2010/10/clip_image002.jpg" alt="clip_image002" width="182" height="272"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Earlier this week I wrote about Jonathan Bloom’s new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738213640?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0738213640"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half Of Its Food (and what we can do about it)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On a related note, this afternoon my wonderful and brilliant colleague &lt;a href="http://www.webberenergygroup.com/"&gt;Michael Webber&lt;/a&gt; will be on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201010083"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Friday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the energy lost in the food we waste (&lt;em&gt;yes, the very same topic &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727735.600-stop-wasting-food-save-the-worlds-energy.html"&gt;we wrote about in New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Today’s episode is broadly entitled “&lt;em&gt;Healthy Eating&lt;/em&gt;:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 26 percent of the nation’s adults eat vegetables three or more  times a day, according to a recent report from the CDC. At the same  time, the USDA estimates that Americans waste 27% of their food — the  energy equivalent of ~350 million barrels of oil a year. In this  segment, we’ll look at our eating habits, and why they can be hard to  change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/walter-willett/"&gt;Walter Willett&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the Nutrition Department at Harvard’s School of Public Health will be on as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201010083"&gt;tune in&lt;/a&gt; or listen to the podcast–this will be a great show! And don’t forget that &lt;em&gt;Science Friday&lt;/em&gt; needs &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/10/06/call-to-action-save-science-friday/"&gt;your support&lt;/a&gt; now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

Results will then be posted here for the bemusement of all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-4878927883000666618?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286550998737"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29553">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0742db17ace375ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Are Anti-Gay Christians Responsible for the Suicide Trend?</title><published>2010-10-08T15:00:58Z</published><updated>2010-10-08T15:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/08/are-anti-gay-christians-responsible-for-the-suicide-trend/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I almost agreed with &lt;strong&gt;Laurie Higgins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. It freaked me out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was writing about the recent, awful trend of young gay men committing suicide and mentioned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/victim-secret-dorm-sex-tape-commits-suicide/story?id=11758716"&gt;Tyler Clementi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the teenager who jumped off the George Washington Bridge to his death after his roommate secretly broadcast Tyler hooking up with another guy in their dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=35040"&gt;Laurie writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Despite what homosexualists immediately pronounced, there is no indication that the taping was motivated by anti-homosexual animus. &lt;strong&gt;It seems at least possible that the students who engaged in this unconscionable act would have done likewise even if it had been a heterosexual act.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t the moral views about homosexuality of the students who filmed Tyler that were the problem, but rather that they have grown up in an invasive, obscene culture that has turned sexuality into a public spectator sport and kids into exhibitionists. Just look at the television shows and films that our children watch and the photos that teens post on their Facebook pages to understand better how they view sexuality and modesty.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on everything I’ve read, there’s something to that. I haven’t read anything that said the roommate, &lt;strong&gt;Dharun Ravi&lt;/strong&gt;, had a “gay people are evil sinners” mentality so much as he just wanted to embarrass the shit out of his roommate — and Tyler making out with a guy would have accomplished that.  I’m obviously not condoning what the roommate did, but I also think it’s possible he would’ve done the same thing if there was a woman in Tyler’s room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. I agree with Laurie. My world has been flipped upside-do—–oh, wait.  Wait.  She didn’t stop there.  Apparently, she has more to say about Tyler: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps if Tyler had not been taught the bleakly deterministic view that he was “born” homosexual, he would have had more hope for the future and would have been more likely to resist homosexual temptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if the culture had not filled Tyler’s head with titillating homosexual images and fallacious ideas, his conscience would have been stronger than his impulses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if university life were not so decadent and hedonistic, students would not be engaging in sexual acts — heterosexual or homosexual — with the ease and frequency with which they do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*facepalm*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if Christians pulled their heads out of their asses and realized that some people are simply gay and there’s nothing wrong with that regardless of what their despicable holy book says, there would be more gay teenagers alive today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, Laurie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to make the case that “bullying” gay people (which she says she doesn’t partake in) is different from moral disapproval of homosexuality (which she supports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what people who share her Christian faith have said about gay people — expressing their disapproval, of course, not bullying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“[Homosexuals are] brute beasts…part of a vile and satanic system [that] will be utterly annihilated, and there will be a celebration in heaven.” — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/homquote.htm"&gt;Jerry Falwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.” — &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18%3A22&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;The Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God hates fags” — You know damn well who.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m being unfair. Those are the extremists. The Bible quotation is “out of context.”  That’s not very nice of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really use statements made by reasonable people in modern times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“[T]he rainbow colors of the homosexual movement [point] to the substitution of the worship of man for the worship of God and &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/informed/contentview.asp?c=34905"&gt;leads to depravity and destruction&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sane person would ever argue that &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/informed/contentview.asp?c=34903"&gt;homosexuals have contributed nothing to society&lt;/a&gt;. That’s as absurd as claiming that adulterers, porn users, or gossips have contributed nothing to society… Those who experience, for example, selfish, vain, greedy, gluttonous, deceitful, promiscuous, incestuous, sadistic, pederastic, gossipy, philandering, or polyamorous impulses and engage in behaviors impelled by such impulses have also contributed to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who self-identify as homosexual are &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/dsa/contentview.asp?c=34354"&gt;no different from those who are selfish, greedy, envious, prideful, fornicators, gossips, or gluttons&lt;/a&gt;. All of us come to the cross as sinners, and none will be fully sanctified until Christ’s return, but retreat from or obfuscation of what the Bible teaches about selfishness, greed, envy, pride, fornication, gossip, gluttony, homosexuality, or any other of the myriad manifestations of sin is simply not scriptural-and therefore not good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are all from Laurie.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See?  She’s not a bully.  Just expressing her disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the sad part about this? I don’t think for a second that Laurie hates gay people. I think she genuinely wants the best for gays and lesbians.  I think she’d be among the first in line to say they shouldn’t be bullied.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that she thinks her “moral disapproval” is somehow better than formal bullying.  She’s on “God’s side” and therefore she can say things that those of us not deluded by Christianity see as offensive and untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sorry, was I being a bully to Christians right there? I was just expressing my disapproval…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Christians like her don’t understand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have to go through life being told you don’t deserve the same rights everyone else has, that you’re somehow broken, that the only thing that will “save” you is a life devoid of physical intimacy and a dose of Jesus, that the feelings you’ve always had for certain people of the same sex are corrupt and in need of a cure… of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; you’re going to be more depressed than the rest of the population. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; you’re going to be more likely to commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative Christians love to argue that homosexuality is just one of many sins and they’re all equal.  But how often do you hear pastors talking about envy, gluttony, and the lottery?  They single out homosexuality as something far worse than everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they put their fingers in their ears and deny they they have anything to do with gay teens committing suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know they’re not directly encouraging the suicides. But they are promoting a false idea that heterosexuality is right and homosexuality is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t call that bullying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are on the wrong side of the issue and they’ll stay there as long as their holy books and pastors tell them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point does “moral disapproval” turn into “bullying”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple other thoughts on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melissa McEwan&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2010/10/i-write-letters_06.html"&gt;said it very well&lt;/a&gt; at Shakesville:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can argue all you want that the solution is Christian compassion &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; a belief that being gay is sinful, but as long as you believe and preach and teach that gay kids are inherently abominable to God, you’re always going to be part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, the philosophical contortions in which many Christians like to engage, claiming God only hates homosexuality but doesn’t hate homosexual people, does not absolve you of your responsibility. Treating people as though their humanity is somehow separate from their intrinsic characteristics is not merely absurd bullshit; when you seek to wrench apart the components of people’s whole selves and throw away pieces of their identities, it’s just eliminationist rhetoric dressed up in its Sunday best.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Marin&lt;/strong&gt; straddles the Christian world and the LGBT community, but &lt;a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/news/commentary/11639266/page0/"&gt;he misses the mark entirely&lt;/a&gt; by trying to blame both sides for not doing enough to “save” Tyler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To me, both [Dan] Savage and [Albert] Mohler — who represent the mainstream in both of their worlds — are doing nothing more than passing the buck once again. It’s always someone else’s deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savage doesn’t think he had anything to do with these suicides – he blames social conservatives. Mohler doesn’t think he has anything to do with these suicides either — he’s still questioning how someone else’s church should have intervened, asking, “was there &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; who could have stood between that boy and that bridge?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Savage had &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with the suicides. That’s obvious.  Albert Mohler, on the other hand, still pushes the slander that homosexuality is sinful.  Don’t even try to equate the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is on the morally acceptable path.  The other is Albert Mohler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His cameos in Marvel movies and on &lt;i&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt; aside, he's pretty much gone off the deep end since he and Marvel parted ways. There was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripperella"&gt;Stripperella&lt;/a&gt;, for starters, and even worse was the Backstreet Boys superhero comics he published under his thankfully ill-fated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_lee_media"&gt;Stan Lee Media&lt;/a&gt; imprint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's face it, True Believers: Stan the Man has lost his touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His current project is called, rather pretentiously, The Guardian Project. For The Guardian Project, Stan will be creating a new superhero for each team in the National Hockey League. Seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a longtime, if somewhat lapsed, hockey fan, I simply couldn't let this one go without comment. Luckily, JoBlo writer Paul Tassi got me started:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sure, the Predators, Panthers, Sharks, Lightning, etc probably won't  have that hard of a time, but what about some of the others? &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Toronto's Maple Ma&lt;/b&gt;n - With the power to shoot syrup out of his eyes. The bad guys will be sticky beyond belief!&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Ottawa's Super Senato&lt;/b&gt;r  - With the power to move legislation to a standstill!&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaheim's Danger Duck&lt;/b&gt; - Mess with this duck, and he'll annoy the shit out of you by quacking for hours!&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York's The Islander&lt;/b&gt; - Able to surround himself by water at any given moment!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I thought I'd finish out his list. Click below the fold to find my suggestions for Stan to make The Guardian Project far more memorable than a comic book where one of the Backstreet Boys is a magical ninja.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Boston Bruin:&lt;/b&gt; Spends all of hockey season hibernating and living off stored body fat. When awake, during baseball season, has a preternatural ability to catch leaping fish in his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sabre of Buffalo: &lt;/b&gt;An immortal Civil War general who swordfights from atop an enormous shaggy bison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Montreal Canadien:&lt;/b&gt; He'll annoy the shit out of you with his bastard French and his super-irritating Quebecois independence rhetoric!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jersey Devil: &lt;/b&gt;With the power to totally not exist!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New York Ranger: &lt;/b&gt;Can dual-wield with reduced penalties. Weakness to having his pic-a-nic basket stolen by The Boston Bruin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Philadelphia Flyer:&lt;/b&gt; Can fly, of course, but is always accompanied by inspirational music by Bill Conti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Pittsburgh Penguin:&lt;/b&gt; Walks for long distances while narrated by Morgan Freeman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Atlanta Thrasher:&lt;/b&gt; Wow. Here's how out of touch with hockey I've become: I looked up "thrasher" in Wikipedia for a humorous commentary, and it turns out that this team is actually named after a small bird that digs for bugs with its tail. Way to go, Atlanta. You've picked a worse bird than "penguin" for a hockey team name. To make up for this, The Atlanta Thrasher is instead an 80s metalhead who moshes the badguys to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Carolina Hurricane:&lt;/b&gt; Able to flood the hell out of New Orleans at a moment's notice.

(Incidentally, isn't having a Canadian team called "The Canucks" kind of like having a hockey team from Ireland called "The Micks?")&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Chicago Blackhawk:&lt;/b&gt; Kills Americans on behalf of the British.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Columbus Blue Jacket: &lt;/b&gt;Fairly ineffective as he is undergoing a constant identity crisis: is he a Shawnee war chief? Is he a Union soldier from the Civil War?

It is quite possible that on your laptop, your Google Calendar may look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

It’s still a little bit too faint to see without aid of binoculars or a telescope, but it’s getting brighter: on October 20th it’ll pass by the Earth at a distance of a mere 18 million km (11 million miles)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers all over the planet are jumping at a chance to see a comet up close… and the views they’re getting are really, really cool. Behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/486264main_pia13438-full_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/wise_hartley2.jpg" alt="wise_hartley2" title="wise_hartley2" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Hartley 2 &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20101005.html"&gt;as seen by WISE&lt;/a&gt;, an orbiting NASA mission designed to survey the sky in the infrared, so it’s very sensitive to objects that astronomers consider warm — that is, a few degrees above absolute zero! &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/17/the-first-spectacular-views-of-the-sky-from-wise/"&gt;It’s seen comets before&lt;/a&gt;, since they fit the warm-to-astronomers-but-freezing-to-anyone-else category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, the actual solid part of the comet is only a few kilometers across, far smaller than a single pixel in this picture. But it’s loaded with frozen ices which turn into gas as the comet nears the Sun, enshrouding the nucleus with fuzz, and streaming behind it as that long, long tail. In this picture, the tail is nearly 2 million kilometers in extent — well over a million miles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/35/image/a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_hartley2.jpg" alt="hst_hartley2" title="hst_hartley2" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What I think is funny is what sometimes happens when you try to zoom in on the head of the comet: you get a fuzzy picture like this one. It’s hard to see detail in a comet, and sometimes when you use more magnification this is all you get. It may surprise you to find out this is a photo from &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/35/image/a/"&gt;the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it looks blurry, this is actually a very important picture. In a few weeks, &lt;a href="http://epoxi.umd.edu/"&gt;the NASA mission EPOXI&lt;/a&gt; — what used to be called Deep Impact, but has now been re-purposed to look at planets around other stars and objects in our own solar system — will be passing near the comet, and images like this will help astronomers get a better understanding of how the comet is behaving (as well as more accurate positions for the comet over time). Also, this image does allow astronomers to estimate the size of the comet’s solid nucleus: it’s about 1.5 km (0.9 miles) across. That’s fair-to-middlin’ as these things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes comets emit jets of gas from frozen pockets on their surface. This can spin the comet up, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/hbhoods.html"&gt;and also sculpt amazing spiral patterns&lt;/a&gt;… and create hazards for any passing spacecraft. Hubble’s image doesn’t show any jets here, but had they been there they’d have been spotted. The fact that the comet looks relatively featureless is actually a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all reminds me of a time in grad school when a bright comet was well-positioned to see from where I was. I remember looking at it through binoculars and it was spectacular! I was excited to look through a big telescope, figuring it would be a jaw-dropping view. But when I got to the eyepiece, it looked like I was examining a Q-tip with a magnifying glass. Sometimes, the long view is prettier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/images/CometHartley2-bw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/Hartley-2-at-Cas.gif" alt="Hartley-2-at-Cas" title="Hartley-2-at-Cas" width="341" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With Hartley 2, you can get your own chance to see it! It’s currently high in the northern sky just south of the constellation of Cassiopeia, which is easy to spot as a giant &lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt; in the northeast once the sky gets dark after sunset. Hartley 2 is still faint, and there are lots of things to see in that region of sky, so it’ll be a bit tough if you’re not familiar with the area. Helpfully, &lt;a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/images/CometHartley2-bw.jpg"&gt;Sky and Telescope magazine has a great finder chart&lt;/a&gt; online. They also have &lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/102632669.html"&gt;descriptions of it and where it’ll be for the next few weeks&lt;/a&gt;. But right now the Moon is new, and so the skies will be darker: so if you have binoculars and a dark site, now is the time to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you can’t find it, that’s OK: stay outside, and scan the heavens with your binoculars. Jupiter is up, for example, and there’s so much to see! A night spent under the stars is never wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

Because the study, published in &lt;a href="http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2009/01/01/socrel.srp026.full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sociology of Religion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Neil Gross at the University of British Columbia and Solon Simmons at George Mason University, supposedly shows that American professors are nowhere near as Godless as people think.  That seems to hearten people who worry that American higher education is infested with nefarious atheists.  Remember &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/ecklund-is-framing-again/"&gt;Elaine Ecklund’s palpable relief &lt;/a&gt;at her supposed demonstration that American scientists are also more religious than people think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, neither the authors nor Amarasingham (nor Ecklund, in her study) know what people think about the atheism of the professoriat.  They cite no surveys of this nor give any data themselves.  They merely assert that Americans think that professors are all raving atheists.  And the data show that that’s not the case, though professors prove to be &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less religious than the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gross and Simmons study has a long and boring introduction about the incursion of religion in American universities and of secularism in the faculty.  And their study has a curious motivation: not to &lt;em&gt;find out &lt;/em&gt;the degree of atheism among professors, but &lt;em&gt;to show that it’s not pervasive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our aim in undertaking this largely descriptive endeavor is precisely to cast doubt on assumptions of faculty atheism, not because we ourselves have any interest in advancing a religious agenda, but because such assumptions have kept a range of important sociological questions—about the processes and mechanisms responsible for the distribution of religious views in academe, as well as about the potential consequences of religiosity for teaching, research, and other faculty attitudes—from being given the attention they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just weird: no real science paper would have as its aim to demonstrate a certain phenomenon.  Presumably studies like this are supposed to find the truth, not “cast doubt.”  Well, maybe the authors are just guilty of hamhanded writing.  What did they find?  They surveyed 1417 professors at American colleges and universities (including junior colleges), sampling from a wide swath of disciplines.  Here’s a precis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among professors, 9.8% say “I don’t believe in God” (this compares to 3% among the public as a whole), 13.1% say “I don’t know whether there is a God” (4.1% of Americans as a whole). That makes 22.9% of the professoriat atheists or agnostics, compared to 7.1% of the public. In other words, in America irreligiosity is three times more pervasive among professors than among the public.  To mitigate the sting of this statistic, Gross and Simmons aver that “skepticism is by no means the most common stance toward religion of professors.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The frequency of other beliefs among professors includes “I do believe in a higher power”, 19.2%; “I find myself believing in God some of the time”, 4.3%; “While I have doubts, I feel that I do believe in God,” 16.6%; and “I know God really exists and I have no doubts about it,” 34.9% (2% gave no answer). The authors don’t compare this to beliefs among the public at large (they did no surveys of this group).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more “elite” the university, the more pervasive the unbelief.  At “elite doctoral universities,” 36.5% of professors are agnostics or atheists, a figure that drops to 22.7% at “nonelite doctoral granting universities” and 15.3% at community colleges. Conversely, 44.5% of community-college professors have no doubt that God exists, compared to only 20.4% of professors at elite doctoral universities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you might expect, the area of scholarship makes a big difference in the degree of belief.  While only 6.1% of “health” professors were atheists or agnostics, this figure was 29.3% for humanities, 32.6% for computer science and engineering, 39.4% for social sciences, and a whopping 42.4% for physical and biological sciences.  When disciplines were divided more finely, biologists and psychologists nearly tied as the most heathen, with 60.8% of biologists and 60.9% of psychologists being agnostics and atheists, though there were relatively fewer outright atheists among the biologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much succor these data can provide to those who worry about the incursion of atheism into universities. Yes, about half the professors are still religious—though not among scientists—but who ever thought that we were &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; atheists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Gross and Simmons, in their discussion, are clearly heartened by the results, and just as clearly wanted to find a pro-religion result. What kind of “objective” study is that? They note at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of these and other lines of future investigation, we have shown that religious believers are more common in the ranks of the American faculty than many strands of social-scientific analysis—and much popular discourse—would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, at HuffPo, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amarnath-amarasingam/how-religious-are-america_b_749630.html"&gt;Amarasingham also breathes a sigh of relief:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What all of these data make clear, and future studies are sure to  further complicate, is that the simplistic association of “intelligent”  with “atheist” is not backed by the evidence. “Our findings call into  question the long-standing idea among theorists and sociologists of  knowledge that intellectuals, broadly construed, comprise an  ideologically cohesive group in society and tend naturally to be  antagonistic toward religion,” write Gross and Simmons. The idea that  “the worldview of the intelligentsia is necessarily in tension with a  religious worldview, is plainly wrong.” In contrast, the evidence seems  to suggest that instead of leaving religion behind, the intelligentsia,  like the rest of society, rationally wrestle with ideas, scientific and  religious, and attempt to find answers to the big questions that plague  us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind the three-times-greater irreligiosity among faculty than among the public, never mind the correlation of atheism and agnosticism with the quality of the institution: the faitheists and accommodationists can always spin the data to their liking so long as the correlation isn’t perfect and 100% of professors aren’t atheists.

It was also fertile ground for skeptical blogging for two reasons. First, it was a major health-related story. Second, the mass vaccination campaigns for H1N1 that governments thew together hurriedly was a magnet for quacks, cranks, and loons of the anti-vaccine variety. Truly, the craziness came fast and furious, with each new day bringing a new atrocity against science and reason. Indeed, even one of my favorite magazines, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, wasn't immune, as demonstrated by a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/when_methodolatry_strikes_over_h1n1_influenza.php"&gt;truly execrable attack on the H1N1 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that was so bad that, as a subscriber for over 25 years, I canceled my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this year doesn't seem to be nearly as bad. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the much less heated response to the beginning of the 2010-2011 flu season should be fairly obvious. For one thing, there has been ample time to produce the vaccine and incorporate H1N1 antigens in it, along with other predicted strains of influenza virus that will be circulating. For another thing, there is much less of a sense of urgency. Even though H1N1 tended to affect the young more severely than the old, the predictions of a 1918-like pandemic that would kill millions did not come to pass, although the severity of its attack did &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3131"&gt;strain resources at some hospitals&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, we weathered H1N1 and have a better idea what to expect this year. A lot of what was so scary last year is that we didn't know for sure what to expect. Unfortunately, because we were fortunate and the pandemic didn't kill as many people as was feared, anti-vaccine loons have proclaimed all the precautions and the mass vaccination programs undertaken as unnecessary wastes of resources or, in the crazier circles, a massive plot by big pharma to increase its bottom line. Truly, I do not envy public health officials. They're damned if they do and damned if they don't. They mount a massive public health effort to prevent a pandemic and get blamed for overreacting when the pandemic isn't as bad as feared. You can be absolutely certain that, had the pandemic turned out to be as bad as feared and public health officials not reacted, they would have been blamed for not doing enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this means that there isn't plenty of anti-vaccine crazy to go around this year. It's just that it's more a run-of-the-mill anti-vaccine crazy compared to last season. In a way, that's kind of a relief. It was tiring to deal with post after post by the anti-vaccine movement about the flu. Still, this year, there is a new trend in flu vaccination programs, and that's an increasing trend towards hospitals requiring that their staff be vaccinated against seasonal flu. Indeed, that is the case at the cancer center where I work, as I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/off_to_get_my_flu_vaccine.php"&gt;mentioned a couple of days ago&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, at our cancer center, anyone involved with patient contact, from physicians to nurses to aides to receptionists, is required to be vaccinated against the seasonal flu. Anyone can refuse, but refusal carries a price. Anyone who refuses will be required to wear a mask during any time they are in patient care areas or otherwise anyplace where they might interact with patients. To me this seemed a reasonable compromise between the health care imperative that leads us to protect not just ourselves but our patients and personal freedom. The only thing I would have added to it is to require anyone refusing the vaccine to wear gloves as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, requiring health care professionals to do what they should do anyway out of duty to themselves and their patients does not sit well with certain people. People like the Grande Dame of the antivaccine movement, Barbara Loe Fisher, for example. The other day, she posted a very telling screed (along with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULFjk1-Efew"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, of course) entitled &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/September-2010/Forcing-Flu-Shots-on-Health-Care-Workers-Who-Is-N.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Forcing Flu Shots on Health Care Workers: Who Is Next?&lt;/a&gt; It's also &lt;a href="http://vaccineawakening.blogspot.com/2010/09/forcing-flu-shots-on-health-care.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;crossposted on BLF's blog&lt;/a&gt;, Vaccine Awakening. Not surprisingly, BLF's piece of obvious co-opting of libertarian (dare I say, even, Tea Party-ish?) impulses in the service of her anti-vaccine agenda was rapidly &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/10/forcing-flu-shots-on-health-care-workers-who-is-next.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;picked up by the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/barbara_loe_fisher_versus_the_flu_vaccin.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/barbara_loe_fisher_versus_the_flu_vaccin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/wtNGM73Eqic" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286539107792"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/nobel_peace_prize_liu_xiaobo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da35b292218caa2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Nobel Peace Prize: Liu Xiaobo</title><published>2010-10-08T12:48:10Z</published><updated>2010-10-08T12:48:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/C7v3uiooyCI/nobel_peace_prize_liu_xiaobo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/nobel_peace_prize_liu_xiaobo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights" - a prize likely to enrage the Chinese government, which had warned the Nobel committee not to honor him.

(Activist &lt;strong&gt;Leslie Zukor&lt;/strong&gt; learned about how atheist books were rarely found in prisons and began a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/09/26/letter-from-a-prisoner/"&gt;freethought books to prisoners&lt;/a&gt; drive.  It was incredible how many prisoners requested books from her.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that acquiring atheist books isn’t anywhere in the radar for the Berkeley County Detention Center in South Carolina, though.  They’re &lt;a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/prisonsc-bible-case.pdf"&gt;far more strict about what prisoners are allowed to read&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Detention Center has a policy and practice of allowing detainees to order from a publisher, and receive by mail, &lt;strong&gt;a soft-cover Bible – but no other books, magazines, or newspapers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detention Center does not have a library to provide detainees access to reading materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the ban on incoming publications and the lack of a library means that detainees have no access to any sort of magazine, newspaper, or book, other than the Bible, while at the Detention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many detainees are held at the Detention Center – and thus deprived of all access to magazines, newspapers, and books, other than the Bible – for months or years on end.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU has &lt;a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/10/only-the-bible-prison-book-policy-challenged.html"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; (on behalf of Prison Legal News and the Human Rights Defense Center) against the Berkeley County Sheriff and employees of the detention center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Detention Center wanted to limit their prisoners to one book, you would think they could’ve gone with something less violent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like an open/shut case to me, if the claims are accurate.  What would be the upside to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130409561"&gt;a policy like this&lt;/a&gt;?  I have no clue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it makes me have all the more appreciation for people like Leslie who do what they can to make sure prisoners are exposed to &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; ideas about religion, not fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried to find out more about this unappetizing snack, I learned that it was featured earlier this year in a weblog post by that &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog+%22Dave+Barry%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;eminent linguist&lt;/a&gt;, Dave Barry ("&lt;a href="http://blogs.herald.com/dave_barrys_blog/2010/05/yum-1.html"&gt;Yum&lt;/a&gt;", 5/20/2010), following up on an article in the Daily Mail ("&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1279806/Its-way-sell-em-From-rude-food-crazy-cleaning-products-worlds-weirdest-brands.html"&gt;Fine Foods from Abroad&lt;/a&gt;", 5/20/2010). A bit later, Only Puke was the lead item in  an impressive catalogue of other bizarre product names  at the British web site Anorak News ("&lt;a href="http://www.anorak.co.uk/248488/keyposts/the-worlds-worst-product-names-presented-by-only-puke-chips.html"&gt;The World’s Worst Product Names, Presented By Only Puke Chips&lt;/a&gt;", 6/21/2010):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;We now continue your look at nominative determinism in consumer goods with some more Sexy Foods and products. You will learn that Terror comes in a variety of flavours, an OAP tastes better in sauce, older boys love Oily Boy, Puke is served in bags and a Double Cock is a Keeper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anorak.co.uk/248488/keyposts/the-worlds-worst-product-names-presented-by-only-puke-chips.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking into the matter further, I learned that an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorak_%28slang%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;anorak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is "a person, usually male, who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The best known explanation of the term, is the use of anoraks (a type of rain jacket) by train spotters, a prototype group for interest in detailed trivia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Although the term is often used synonymously with geek, it suggests a greater degree of social awkwardness, isolation, and obsessiveness, and may be associated by some with Asperger's Syndrome. The Japanese term otaku, or the American term, "fanboy", are probably closer synonyms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anorak.co.uk/anorak-people"&gt;Anorak News&lt;/a&gt; ("reads the tabloids so you don't have to") seems to challenge the boundaries of this stereotype, but the cited product-names post certainly gives evidence of a strong commitment to systematic exploration of what may fairly be considered to be a niche topic.&lt;/p&gt;

These distinctive vocalisations suggest that rather than evolving separately, laughter evolved in a shared common ancestor before becoming tailored in each primate species, including humans.

To find support for this idea, Diana Szameitat and her colleagues scanned the brains of 18 men and women whilst they listened to the sound of human tickle-induced laughter as well as laughter prompted by joy and taunting. The researchers found a &amp;#39;double-dissociation&amp;#39; - the tickle laughter provoked extra activity in the secondary auditory cortex, likely reflecting the acoustical complexity of this kind of laughter, whereas the joy and taunting laughter prompted more activity in the medial frontal cortex, a region associated with social and emotional processing. These differences were observed whether the participants were tasked with categorising the laughter they heard, or merely with counting the number of laughs. The finding suggests that humans produce and process an evolutionarily &amp;#39;old&amp;#39; form of tickle-based laughter, which is shared with non-human primates, as well as a newer, more emotionally sophisticated variant. 

The laughter stimuli were provided by a team of eight professional actors using &amp;#39;auto induction&amp;#39; techniques. This means they used their imagination, memories, and body movements to provoke the required emotions and bodily sensations in themselves as far as they could. The researchers said they only selected laughter samples that had been accurately categorised (as joy, taunting, or tickle laughter) in pilot work at well above chance levels by naive listeners. The dependence on acted laughter does seem to be a weakness of the study, however, especially as it&amp;#39;s a well-documented fact that people are unable to tickle themselves.

&amp;#39;Our study provides suggestive evidence that laughter, in the form of a reflex-like reaction to touch, has been adopted into human social behaviour from animal behaviour,&amp;#39; the researchers said. &amp;#39;Through the differentiation of human social interaction over time this &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; form of laughter may have diversified to become a spectrum of different laughter variants in order to accommodate increased complexity of human social interaction.&amp;#39;

A high vulnerability index identiﬁes years and/or regions where the yield loss was large relative to the size of the drought. A low value of VI indicates that the efﬁcacy of the socio-economic adaptation to drought is high, for example due to good water management, increasing fertilizer, per capita investments in agriculture, and falling numbers of rural households.

The authors point out that investment in resilience and adaptation is most important in areas where high vulnerabilities were found and where crop failures are most likely.  Also, interestingly, they note that while vulnerability generally goes down with increasing GDP, this doesn&amp;#39;t apply in all cases.  Investments specific to adaptive capacity may be more effective than an indiscriminate focus on economic growth.

The paper is titled &amp;quot;Insufficient sleep undermines dietary efforts to reduce adiposity&amp;quot;, which means that if you are person dieting to lose fat then sleeping less will undermine your efforts.

The study compares a group of 10 who were dieting, 6 persons slept for 8.5 hours every night for two weeks and similarly, 4 persons slept for 5.5 hours every night for two weeks. And this was repeated on the same subjects after three months. It was seen that the persons who slept less lost less body-fat more fat-free body mass (such as proteins). In the subjects who lost more fat-free body mass they observed increased hunger, which under normal circumstances, will undermine the efforts of a person dieting.

The conclusion is very clear

Patients attempting to lose weight should consider getting adequate amounts of sleep in addition to limiting calorie intake to ensure that they retain lean muscle mass and lose fat.The conclusion is NOT what The Seattle Times or Los Angeles Times says:

Moral of the study? Put aside the work, or that late-night TV show, and get some shut-eye. Compared to exercise and diet, it&amp;#39;s the easiest part of healthy weight loss.Also remember the limitations of the study

All were nonsmokers aged 35 to 49 years, and none were morbidly obese. Patients were followed for only 2 periods of 2 weeks each, much less than the average amount of time people would usually spend on a calorie-restriction program

Nearly 800,000 SEK (or $120,125.60 US dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to reader &lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The basic law is something like this: if someone is threatened for expressing themselves (in whatever way they may choose) the state will protect that persons person in all of her/his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivial conclusion: There’s a cost to these threats even if we refuse to give in. If we give in, we lose the morals which makes our society great. If we don’t, we’ll have to pay for it by increasing security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of free speech is not just in our minds — people aggressively trying to stop free speech also cost us in tax money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It raises an interesting question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should the government and universities pay before we either take some sort of action against the terrorism or give in and not speak?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Few know that arguably the most vile form of quackery has been getting the thumbs up from a celebrity hailing from the most rarified heights of power and influence — Representative Patricia Schroeder (D-CO, 1973-1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice I’m referring to is “Rage Reduction.” This practice, popular for decades in adoption and foster care circles, claims to help children develop the capacity to love and become attached to their new caregivers. Practitioners believe these children suffer from “Attachment Disorder” because of early abuse and neglect. Typical of quackery, this unrecognized diagnosis consists of an absurdly long catch-all list of signs used to ensnare any child. (Even good behavior is interpreted as sneaky manipulation of parents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Rage Reduction therapy session, a child is restrained by a therapist – usually a licensed psychologist or social worker – plus one or more assistants. The therapist “activates” a child by yelling, belittling, threatening, relentlessly tickling, bouncing the child’s head, covering his mouth, and painfully knuckling the child’s rib cage and sternum. Such sessions typically go on for two or more hours, until the child is exhausted from struggling and becomes, as one psychologist observed, “a whimpering little puddle.” Children, even teenagers, are then swaddled and given a baby bottle by their adopted mother for “bonding time.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The rationale for Rage Reduction consists of several thoroughly discredited notions: the need to regress children back to infancy so that “repressed” memories of abuse can be recovered and repressed “infantile anger” can be drained out through “catharsis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reliable evidence that indicates that Rage Reduction would be anything but harmful. To critics, Rage Reduction is indistinguishable from literal torture, i.e. the infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, for a purpose. The purpose here is apparently &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the creation of loving relationships, but rather grinding down children until they are grateful and unquestioningly obedient. Think “Stepford Children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one particularly brutal form of Rage Reduction called “Compression Therapy,” therapists claim to provoke repressed memories of rape by lying on top of the child and licking the child’s face. Along with violating just about every ethical code in the mental health book, Compression Therapy puts much pressure on the child’s abdomen, making breathing difficult. At least two children have died from suffocation in Rage Reduction sessions; and survivors tell of “seeing stars,” and even of passing out during therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many criminal child abuse and death cases have been linked to Rage Reduction and its harsh parenting methods. For those with a strong stomach, there is a blogsite that has published several &lt;a href="http://stopchildtorture.org/survivors-index/"&gt;survivor accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rage Reduction got its start in Colorado back in the 1970s, when psychologist Robert Zaslow came to the state claiming he could cure blindness. Zaslow had served as consultant on Elvis Presley’s last movie, &lt;em&gt;A Change of Habit&lt;/em&gt; (1969). In this film, “Dr.” Elvis cures a girl of autism in just one Rage Reduction session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rage Reduction failed to cure blindness, or autism off screen, Colorado followers of Zaslow turned to treating “attachment breaks” in children. The practice really took off in the late 1980s when adoptions from Eastern Europe opened up – and when Rage Reduction got a big celebrity bump from none other than US Representative Patricia Schroeder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder was the long-time Democrat Congresswoman representing the Denver area who took a stab at the presidency in 1988. Chairing the US House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, Schroeder billed herself as “Friend of the Family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the peak of her influence, Schroeder also wrote the foreword for a book promoting Rage Reduction entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Risk-Children-Without-Conscience/dp/0553346679/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1284588100&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;High Risk: Children Without A Conscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ken Magid and Carole McKelvey (Bantam, 1987). Today, after one author has surrendered her therapy license (the other is dead), this book is still in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:2em auto" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image3.png" alt="High Risk" width="134" height="209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/em&gt; later took note of Schroeder’s “promotion” of &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High Risk has a foreword by former Colorado Rep. Pat Schroeder, who thanks the authors for their “gift” at a time when inadequate day care, rising divorce rates, and teen pregnancy threaten to inflate the numbers of unattached kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/970714/archive_007404_6.htm"&gt;A Dead Child, A Troubling Defense&lt;/a&gt;” by Miriam Horn)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; was published, HBO aired a documentary about a child being treated by Magid. This film, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME2wmFunCjU"&gt;Child of Rage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was followed up with an HBO drama by the same name. Both films, like the book, portrayed “unattached” children as murderous psychopaths, a danger to parents and society at large. This sensationalism fueled Rage Reduction ascendancy into a fad therapy, with cult-like followings all over the country, and in Britain and Australia, as well. Without Schroeder’s endorsement, Rage Reduction might have otherwise died a quick death — from lack of research, from moral outrage, and from compassion for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; is considered by critics to be the worst book of its kind. If a therapist recommends &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve pretty much got him pegged as an adherent of coercive restraint therapies. No one else would likely want to be associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; contains one photo that nearly says it all. It is a photo of psychiatrist &lt;a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/foster-cline.html"&gt;Foster Cline, MD&lt;/a&gt; knuckling the sternum of a young boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:2em auto" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image-11.png" alt="image-1" width="330" height="452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caption says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster Cline illustrates how a Rage Reduction Therapy session is conducted….Cline stimulates subject toward rage reaction. Child is being held by “holders.” …[the] child screams how much he hates the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a boy with a bruised chest escaped Cline’s center a few years later, Cline was ordered by the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners to stop using Rage Reduction. Cline opted to leave the state instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extreme treatment, which &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; likens to an “exorcism,” is justified by demonizing children with “Attachment Disorder.” The same &lt;em&gt;US New &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/em&gt; article explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cartoon in the book Schroeder promotes depicts a spectrum of well-being: from the securely attached like “Mother Teresa,” illustrated with a haloed saint holding a cross, to the severely unattached like “Charles Manson,” depicted as a horned devil holding a bloody knife. Paula Pickle says of the kids her center [Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado] treats that “there often doesn’t seem to be a heart or soul.” [Thais] Tepper [of Parents&amp;#39; Network for the Post-Institutionalized Child] explains in chilling terms the effort by Russian orphanages to get rid of their most troubled charges: “Who are you going to send abroad, the healthy kids or the little minions of Satan?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:2em auto 1.5em auto" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image-24.png" alt="image-2" width="472" height="273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:1.5em auto 2em auto" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image-31.png" alt="image-3" width="407" height="255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banality of this diagram is almost unworthy of being pseudoscience. It’s not junk science. It’s just plain junk. (But do note, Ms Schroeder, where “Some Politicians” rank on this scale.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; does dabbles in other pseudoscience, as well, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Ted Bundy’s Handwriting Reveals..His manipulative tendencies are indicated by the “hooks” in some of his “c’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rage Reduction, repackaged with the less explicit name of “Attachment Therapy,” flourished through the 1990s. A welter of child welfare workers, CASA volunteers, judges, and adoptive/foster parents were sucked into the pseudoscientific solutions offered by Attachment Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Schroeder’s imprimatur firmly in place, government agencies at federal, state and local levels funneled money into Attachment Therapy, paying for treatment and to house children in special “therapeutic foster homes” versed in Attachment Therapy’s &lt;em&gt;uber&lt;/em&gt; harsh parenting methods, aka &lt;a href="http://childrenintherapy.org/proponents/nancy-thomas/"&gt;Nancy Thomas&lt;/a&gt; parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Nancy Thomas, a Colorado layperson trained by Foster Cline to be a “co-therapist” in Rage Reduction, will be keynoting at an adoption training conference in Tennessee Nov 5, 2010, for which social workers can receive continuing education credits.  The sponsoring organization of this conference, which receives funding from the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, &lt;a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/06/adoptions-conference-instructs-on-adoption/"&gt;advertises&lt;/a&gt; that Thomas’ “work was highlighted in an HBO special in 1990 titled, ‘Child of Rage.’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Iowa, Vermont, Colorado, Virginia, New Hampshire, Utah, and Georgia, public funding paid for training therapists in Attachment Therapy. Adoption Subsidy Funding for “special needs children” could pay for any treatment parents wanted, evidence-based or not, including Attachment Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2002, numerous high-profile deaths and child abuse prosecutions resulted in growing professional condemnation of Attachment Therapy. It was at this time that I wrote Schroeder, on behalf of &lt;a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org"&gt;Advocates for Children in Therapy,&lt;/a&gt; (ACT) fully expecting she would retract her support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Schroeder did not respond, ACT picketed a pricey speaking event in Denver where Schroeder had been chosen to speak because of her “compassion.” Hoping the protest got Schroeder’s attention, I wrote her again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You obviously did the authors of &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; (still in print) an enormous favor by writing a foreword, in effect helping to legitimize the message of their book by lending them your well known name and your reputation as a humanitarian. That is viewed by the public as an endorsement of what is said in the book. Do you presently stand by your decision to have written the foreword for the book &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time Schroeder responded, albeit briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a doctor and can’t endorse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I pressed the issue, she responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a foreword and endorsing a medical authority are two different things. I believe books are to stir thoughts, debate, ideas, etc. The more the better. Different theories on everything are detailed in books. That is the best way to vet them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a rationale, it is unclear whether there would be any book Schroeder wouldn’t write a foreword for. Schroeder’s response prompted Wallace Sampson, MD, to comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A book is not for discussion or debating. That is what journals are for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years later, when the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children released its “Task Force Report on Attachment Therapy” (in the journal &lt;em&gt;Child Maltreatment&lt;/em&gt; Feb 2006) denouncing Attachment Therapy, its parenting methods and the Attachment Disorder diagnosis, I again wrote Schroeder, hoping that some high level dissing of the practice might make her reconsider her position. She didn’t respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest that Schroeder might not have been aware of &lt;em&gt;High Risk’s&lt;/em&gt; contents, and that she is now taking the politically expedient route, hoping the whole issue goes away with time. But while Schroeder has been evasive, she is clearly not regretting her promotion of&lt;em&gt; High Risk&lt;/em&gt;. If she was duped, why not jump ship while the jumping is good? While &lt;em&gt;High Risk&lt;/em&gt; allowed her to pontificate about her own agenda in the foreword, I have a hard time coming to any other conclusion than that Schroeder may actually approve of this “therapy.” Would someone with presidential aspirations write a foreword for just any book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I think we can assume that Schroeder will not be asking Bantam to remove her foreword from future editions of&lt;em&gt; High Risk&lt;/em&gt;, nor will she be calling for legislation that requires federal funding only go to providing evidence-based therapies for adopted children — or any of a dozen other things to help save children from Attachment Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder has good reasons to believe her endorsement of Rage Reduction will not tarnish her reputation. She continues to be feted as one of America’s great humanists. Last year, no less than the Center for Inquiry honored her at their &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/worldcongress/speakers/#pschroeder"&gt;2009 World Congress&lt;/a&gt; and highlighted her participation in their &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/cruise2009/speakers"&gt;Travel Club Adventure&lt;/a&gt; Caribbean cruise. CFI officials were not only unconcerned by Schroeder’s association with Attachment Therapy, but accused critics of  “nastiness” towards a “defender of good science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irony of ironies, Schroeder is now scheduled to keynote for that bastion of evidence-based medicine: The &lt;a href="http://www.regonline.com/builder/site/tab1.aspx?EventID=766689"&gt;Joint Colloquium of the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations&lt;/a&gt; in Keystone, Colorado, on October 18, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As keynoter, Schroeder is billed as the leader of a “multi-year study for the Institute on Civil Society.” But according to ICS, this study produced “no formal document” or publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last March, I gave a heads up to colloquium organizer Robert Dellavalle, MD, about Schroeder’s unrepentant support of Attachment Therapy. When this yielded no response, I did a broad-spectrum emailing to Cochrane and Campbell officials about this brewing scandal, which prompted Dellavalle to respond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leadership discussions so far have noted that invitations to speak at the Colloquium do not constitute an endorsement of any views of the speakers positions past or present. And the topic of your concern is not the topic of Ms. Schroeder’s talk at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On learning the title of Schroeder’s keynote is: “Can we keep this Democracy going?” I responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fail to see how this topic is not relevant to the rights of children to be free from actual torture (using the definition of the UN Convention on Torture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that world seemed upside down when Bill Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award for scientific integrity, so now do things seem topsy-turvy with CFI and the Cochrane/Campbell Collaborations honoring Schroeder as a defender of science and ethics. This is, alas, not the most shining hour for these otherwise esteemed organizations. Once again, the cult of celebrity scores a bullseye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that  inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes  an exhaustive review of public education, surveying “drop-out  factories” and “academic sinkholes,” methodically dissecting the system  and its seemingly intractable problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/teachers/what-teachers-really-need.html"&gt;A teacher whose school was profiled in the documentary&lt;/a&gt;, observed in the Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The film also strongly insinuates that the public education system is utterly broken and the solutions are found in bolting the system to privately run, publicly funded, non-unionized charter schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caught my correspondent’s eye, however, was &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/oprah/"&gt;Oprah Winfrey’s new campaign via Meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; – to gather people together, worldwide, in order to address issues raised by the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a need to do something about the US system. Yes, there are clearly issues. Yes, people talking about them and working together seems a good thing to start doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly? As a teacher, who runs a Meetup.com group, should I be thinking of coordinating a meetup in my town on the basis of this documentary and Oprah’s encouragement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely?&lt;strong&gt; AGRHHRHRHHRHRHRHHRRHHRHRHRHHHHHH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had to get that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another one: &lt;em&gt;Wahrhrhrghhhghhhghahrhrhrhhhh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly  because I spent much of my ’school holidays’ fretting about student  results on an exam, working on an exam, talking to other teachers about  exam, posting out exam, grading exam, fretting more about exam, waiting  by the postbox to get an exam back – and then just got notice about a  fellow teacher’s serious injury… which erm, means that they’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to get my exam back to me. Not by the day I counted on, that’s for certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fellow teacher is hurt. They’re in the hospital. They can’t get any better any quicker,  JUST because I’ve been sitting next to the postbox fretting. Let alone  everyone else who was counting on all of this to be finished and done  with. And my subject isn’t the only final year subject they teach – they have at least one other final-year subject that they’re in charge of. I hate to think of how that has piled up for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I have another one: *&amp;amp;#*&amp;amp;#(*@#*&amp;amp;@^(@&amp;amp;#:#@?&amp;lt;@#*(&amp;amp;!@#+_#!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s better than  inhaling a packet of mint macaroons, which was my first impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I went to the gym and spent a solid hour working on my back  muscles and arm muscles, just to unwind all the tension that had been  building up from working on the computer and not getting enough of my regular running around that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oprah. &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/relationships/All-About-Teachers"&gt;Who has legitimate concerns about the education system in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Fine. I’m with her in that regard and I’d want to do something realistic if I can – which has included, in the recent past, networking with teachers in the US. Already trying to help out, that’s not my worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet she’s touting a &lt;em&gt;documentary&lt;/em&gt;… the same kind of documentary that I teach to students with &lt;span&gt;certain provisions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideological issues infused the production of documentary making from the beginning… informing and entertaining are not necessarily separate… informing and entertaining are not innocent and ideology-free. Information and entertainment are influenced and shaped by particular attitudes. A conflict between supporting the status-quo and dominant ways of thinking and existing power relationships and challenging the same status-quo. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;[Adapted from p.77 of Don Munro's 'Reading And Responses' - a book that's used in secondary English classes in my state.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dominant ways of thinking, this is that same Oprah who has that magazine? That magazine which treated &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6721"&gt;fellow skeptic Dr Harriet Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From January through June of 2010 I wrote a column entitled “The Health Inspector” in &lt;em&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine.&lt;/em&gt; Now, apparently, I have been fired; although they have not had the  common courtesy to tell me so. The whole thing has been a bizarre,  frustrating experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m just a &lt;em&gt;tad&lt;/em&gt; biased then. Just a bit. Even after you point how Oprah can do nice things, well – after all that – oh, you know, &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/29/live-your-best-life-ever.html"&gt;‘autism causes vaccines’ and ’sickness makes you watch Oprah’&lt;/a&gt;… or something like that… ask &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2217798/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy, she knows more about it, she appeared on Oprah often enough.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, apparently on the basis of a documentary (looking at the American education system, with all the inherent biases that a documentary will have), that’s being shown in America (about the &lt;em&gt;American education system&lt;/em&gt;), that deals with a particular issue (that is &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;American education system&lt;/em&gt;) – okay, at what point am I going to start feeling more enthused about rallying to do her bidding here in Australia… on what, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/airfoil.png" alt="null" width="470" height="304"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where I’m stuck. What does Oprah want exactly to change in my country? How much does she know about what’s going on here? Maybe when she visits Australia, she’ll have something to say about the forthcoming National Curriculum (which &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/nsw-cans-inferior-national-curriculum-20100916-15eqw.html"&gt;doesn’t have support from either NSW&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/principals-fail-national-curriculum-20100920-15jqq.html"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;) or perhaps have a chat to &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/the-portfolio-that-dare-not-say-its-name-20100913-15951.html"&gt;Peter Garrett and his portfolio as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and        Youth? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she visits Australian dolphin sanctuaries and snogs a koala or something. Yea Oprah, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brisking through the comments on Oprah Winfrey’s pages, I kept getting the same message from (not just teachers) viewers of ‘Waiting For Superman’ – that this documentary… is &lt;em&gt;just a documentary.&lt;/em&gt; Something that &lt;a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/maureenow/2010/10/03/superman_waiting"&gt;Salon.com picked up on too:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting for Superman &lt;/strong&gt;highlights the damage wrought by bad teachers, the filmmakers did not focus enough on what good teaching looks like. They showed brief footage of one experienced teacher imparting math facts through rhymes and songs. There  were a few classroom scenes in which all of the students sat in rows  with their shirts tucked in, listening attentively to a teacher at the  front of the room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The documentary alluded to the great  results possible in a classroom led by a great teacher, but spent no  time in conversation with one of those high performers.  I would like to  see somebody talk to the energetic, innovative, results-getting  teachers. I’m tired of interviews with people who go into administration after a few years in the classroom… It  is easier to call up egregious examples of bad teaching than it is to  try to unlock the mystery of what makes certain great teachers so  effective. One reason for this is because the truths of what it actually takes to help students succeed are mighty inconvenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have a nasty feeling – that I’d end up helping do a screening (Where? A free screening? Oprah, are you going to somehow book me a cinema and help me round up people to go to it? These things do require planning… and time I just don’t have…) – where the aftermath may involve a bunch of people glaring at me and others in my profession about ‘how many bad people out there who make everyone fail math and shouldn’t be near a classroom let alone another human being’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m starting to think the experience might be more like this, with me as a windup toy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZpY-Kc7X0"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ZpY-Kc7X0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/15444530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/waiting_for_superman/index.html"&gt;brings to mind another review on the documentary – &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Launching a campaign aimed at cutting through all the political noise  and focusing on proven solutions sounds like an admirable goal — &lt;strong&gt;but it  assumes that there are proven solutions and that we know how they work.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the hottest issues in the contemporary educational debate never  come up at all in “Waiting for ‘Superman,” including the compulsive and  universal over-reliance on standardized testing. It never occurs to  Guggenheim to question the exaggerated “academic” focus of early-grade  education — including the longer school day and school year, and  homework in first grade or before — which many researchers now believe  is counterproductive on various levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m fairly confident that I can outrun a pitchfork-flailing enraged crowd of parents who wish to lock me into a fishbowl on the basis of the US teacher unions and tenure policies – can I point out &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; that it’s a different system here? And that, in fact, I am seriously grateful to the teacher union that I joined, which stood up for the rights of NOT ONLY teachers but the non-teaching staff (cleaners, administration, ground-keeping, caretakers, boarding house, etc.) when needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;Well – I’m still mindful of the fact that I have this postbox with a well-trod path around it, waiting for my papers to arrive. At the same time, I’m working on this thesis for my M.Ed, about measurement of educational outcomes. Oh, and by the way, I just had another brainstorm about getting teachers together post-exams in order to help each other out with creating resources? That seems to be a better use of my time, quite frankly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and all the ’skepticism-stuff’ that I already signed up for. Yes, another podcast episode – very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/maureenow/2010/10/03/superman_waiting"&gt;The true answers to education reform lie in the magic that excellent teachers make in classrooms every day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/10/11/101011crci_cinema_denby?currentPage=2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How  can reforms that work some of the time in small schools with engaged  kids and committed parents work in an enormous urban school with all  kinds of kids? Will the charter ideals continue to benefit only a  minority, or do they have the potential to change everything?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="color:#003399" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/10/11/101011crci_cinema_denby?currentPage=2#ixzz11jies7yS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will certainly make the effort to watch this documentary when it does reach this country, simply because I love watching documentaries (and I really enjoy teaching them too). But quite frankly? I have the job of teaching to finish first. One more term of 2010 to go.&lt;/p&gt;

The concept comes out of the motor control literature where one can find pretty solid evidence that motor control makes use of forward predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands (e.g., check out the seminal paper by Wolpert, Ghahramani, &amp;amp; Jordan, 1995).  These concepts have been extended to speech (e.g., Tourville et al. 2008; van Wassenhove et al., 2005) and there has been a ton of work trying to establish the neural correlates of these networks (e.g., see Golfinopoulos et al. 2009; Shadmehr &amp;amp; Krakauer, 2008), recent work suggesting an association with clinical conditions such as aspects of schizophrenia (Heinks-Maldonado, et al. 2007) and stuttering (Max et al. 2004), and even applications of the concept of high-level cognition such as &amp;quot;thought&amp;quot; (Ito, 2008), as well as applications to social cognition (Wolpert et al. 2003) with links to the mirror system (Miall, 2003).I&amp;#39;m a big fan of control theory in general and I think there is a lot to be gained by thinking about speech processes in these terms.  At the same time, I&amp;#39;m a little uncomfortable with the widespread application of these models.  It kind of reminds me of the mirror neuron situation in that a framework for thinking about one problem is generalized to all kinds of situations.  I&amp;#39;m also a bit uncomfortable about the assumed tethering between forward models and the motor system.  A forward model is just a prediction.  In the context of motor control, it makes sense to make predictions (e.g., sensory predictions) based on the likely outcomes of motor commands.  But more generally, predictions can come from lots of sources.  Perceptual fill-in processes are a kind of forward model: the visual system for example makes predictions about the color and texture of a given portion of the visual scene based on the color and texture around that region.   One can predict the consequences of an ocean wave hitting a rock based on past perceptual experiences.  So forward models don&amp;#39;t have to come from the motor system and there are probably lots of systems and mechanisms that generate predictions (forward models).  It is worth having a look at Karniel&amp;#39;s (2002) short comment, &amp;quot;Three creatures named &amp;#39;forward model&amp;#39;&amp;quot; for some cautionary discussion.So is the internal forward model concept just hype?  No, I don&amp;#39;t think so.  It has already demonstrated its utility in the motor control literature and there are systems in the brain that appear to support motor-related forward models (cerebellum is one, posterior parietal cortex is another). There are some real insights to be gained from this framework in the speech domain as well, but I think there is the danger of over-application of the concept and we need to proceed cautiously.

When you take a look up at the sky, the two most prominent objects are the Sun and the Moon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/MoonMercury_zubenel_c800.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/MoonMercury_zubenel_c800-thumb-500x343-56630.jpeg" width="500" height="343" alt="MoonMercury_zubenel_c800.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every day, like clockwork, they rise in the East and set in the West.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why's that?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/earth_rotation_anim.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="earth_rotation_anim.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth rotates on its North-South axis!  Not only does it rotate, but it rotates &lt;i&gt;from West to East&lt;/i&gt;, and that's why we see everything rise in the East and set in the West over the course of a day &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/Biolumiscence_Star_Trail_sm.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/Biolumiscence_Star_Trail_sm-thumb-500x666-56633.jpeg" width="500" height="666" alt="Biolumiscence_Star_Trail_sm.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image Credit: &lt;a href="http://www.philhart.com/gallery/Astrophotography/Phenomena/Biolumiscence_Star_Trail_sm.jpg.html"&gt;Phil Hart&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets better, though.  If you rose up, above the Earth's North Pole, and looked down at the Earth as it revolved around the Sun, not only would the Earth &lt;i&gt;spin counterclockwise&lt;/i&gt;, it would also orbit the Sun &lt;i&gt;counterclockwise&lt;/i&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/radec_earth_orbit.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/radec_earth_orbit.gif" width="500" alt="radec_earth_orbit.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might ask what other objects in the Solar System do?  We can start with the Moon, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/moon.orbit.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/moon.orbit-thumb-500x225-56637.jpeg" width="500" height="225" alt="moon.orbit.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you might expect, the Moon both orbits counterclockwise around Earth &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; rotates counterclockwise on its axis, so that the same side of it always faces us!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine, fine, you say.  But what about the other planets?  Isn't there some variety there?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/Solar%20System.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/Solar%20System-thumb-500x371-56639.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="Solar System.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a chance.  Not in the least, in fact!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do all of the rocky planets revolve counterclockwise around the Sun, and not only do all of the gas giant planets revolve counterclockwise around the Sun, but something like &lt;i&gt;99%&lt;/i&gt; of the known asteroids, kuiper belt objects, and comets &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; revolve counterclockwise around the Sun!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHY?!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/sunbirth.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/sunbirth-thumb-500x333-56641.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="sunbirth.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars -- &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of them, as far as we know -- form when clouds of gas collapse.  Since one direction will be shorter, that will collapse first, and so we'll get a disc.  (Or, in our "complicated scientific jargon," a &lt;i&gt;pancake&lt;/i&gt;.  Yes, seriously, you say &lt;i&gt;pancake&lt;/i&gt; to an astrophysicist and they'll know you're talking about this process.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this pancake isn't just going to sit there.  In general, there will be an overall, bulk, rotational motion, due to the law of &lt;a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/2cl/ch05/ch05.html"&gt;conservation of angular momentum&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So not only should the planets all revolve in the same direction, but if this idea is correct, the &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt; should rotate counterclockwise, too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/rotation.gif" width="500" alt="rotation.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not only does it rotate counterclockwise, we can &lt;i&gt;measure&lt;/i&gt; that rotation by following sunspots!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you might decide to look at the individual planets, and see if they not only &lt;i&gt;revolve&lt;/i&gt; counterclockwise about the Sun, but if they also &lt;i&gt;rotate&lt;/i&gt; counterclockwise about their own axes, tilted or not.  The results may surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/obliquity.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/obliquityofplanets.jpg" width="500" alt="obliquityofplanets.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Calvin Hamilton, and click for a huge version!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune all rotate counterclockwise, at tilts varying from less than a degree up to substantial, significant tilts, two planets stand out as weirdos.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/twobizarreworlds.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are/twobizarreworlds-thumb-500x385-56647.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="twobizarreworlds.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus, rotating &lt;i&gt;almost perfectly backwards&lt;/i&gt;, and Uranus, rotating &lt;i&gt;on its side&lt;/i&gt;, are the unexplained bizarre children of our Solar System.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some Moons (like Neptune's Triton) that go backwards, we can't blame Venus and Uranus on gravitational capture.  There are &lt;a href="http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q50.html"&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; out there, such as big collisions in the young Solar System, but there is currently &lt;i&gt;no compelling evidence&lt;/i&gt; that favors any one theory over the other.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; everything in the Solar System revolves and rotates counterclockwise (from the North), but Venus?  Uranus?  We just don't get it, at least, not yet.  Even in something as well-studied as our Solar System, we still have plenty of unexplained mysteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/10/counterclockwise_but_there_are.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286495755967"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=2515">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e86d76892f12de3e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="aliens &amp; UFOs"/><category term="creationism"/><category term="science"/><category term="mars"/><category term="evolution"/><category term="biology"/><category term="intelligent design"/><category term="ID"/><category term="Discovery Institute"/><category term="Wedge document"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Christianity"/><category term="education"/><category term="God"/><category term="angels"/><category term="aliens"/><category term="court"/><category term="pareidolia"/><category term="illusion"/><category term="Bible"/><category term="Jesus"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="Dover trial"/><category term="materialism"/><category term="Wedge Strategy"/><category term="schools"/><category term="public schools"/><category term="Center for Science and Culture"/><category term="theology"/><category term="Casey Luskin"/><category term="IDM"/><category term="intelligent design movement"/><category term="Dover vs Kitzmiller"/><category term="model"/><category term="design inference"/><category term="Dembski"/><category term="Luskin"/><category term="DI"/><category term="Face on Mars"/><category term="Mount Rushmore"/><title type="html">My Challenge to the Discovery Institute’s “Design Inference” Model</title><published>2010-10-07T23:55:51Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T23:55:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/my-challenge-to-the-discovery-institutes-design-inference-model/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an earlier blog post, &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/my-thoughts-on-attending-casey-luskins-intelligent-design-talk-at-the-university-club-of-chicago/"&gt;I gave a detailed rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; to a lecture by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute"&gt;Discovery Institute’s&lt;/a&gt; Casey Luskin titled “Intelligent Design: Dead Science or the Future of Biology?” – however, it wasn’t until recently that I came up with what I consider to be the real killer criticism of a basic &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/intelligentdesign.html"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; argument: their so-called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_Inference"&gt;“design inference” model.&lt;/a&gt; During his talk, Casey Luskin showed a picture of Mount Rushmore, which he stated the design inference model shows is clearly a product of ID, not the result of natural processes.  The implication is, of course, that much of evolutionary science is false because ID’s design inference model can prove that ID is a better explanation; but there’s a fatal flaw here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture1" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture1.jpg?w=553&amp;amp;h=415" alt="" width="553" height="415"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic argument is simply a variation of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy"&gt;classic watchmaker argument&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance.&lt;/a&gt; Not to mention, Luskin has stacked the deck in favor of the ID design inference model because every time an ID-advocate trots out their model it is in the context of a post-hoc analysis: they &lt;em&gt;already know ahead of time&lt;/em&gt; that the object/situation they’re analyzing is the product of intelligent (human) processes.  Hell, of course Mount Rushmore is the result of (human) ID, because we have records &amp;amp; photos of humans chipping away at the damn rock!  So &lt;em&gt;they can’t lose&lt;/em&gt; – in this sense, the ID folks are proposing a &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Falsifiability"&gt;non-falsifiable model&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it NON-science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After thinking more deeply about Luskin’s claims, which seem to be fundamental to the entire ID argument, I came up with this rebuttal: &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/faceonmars.html"&gt;the Face on Mars.&lt;/a&gt; Below I have two pictures of the infamous Face on Mars – the top picture was one of the originals from the Viking mission in 1976, while the bottom picture came from the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture2" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture2.jpg?w=261&amp;amp;h=293" alt="" width="261" height="293"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture3" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/picture3.jpg?w=370&amp;amp;h=278" alt="" width="370" height="278"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an ID advocate applied their design inference model to the picture on the top, in 1976, they would have undoubtedly concluded (like many others) that this feature was the result of (human, alien, angelic, Godly?) ID.  However, upon further analysis, the image on the bottom reveals that this &lt;em&gt;illusion&lt;/em&gt; of intelligent design was simply the result of natural processes &amp;amp; chance (much as evolution explains the illusion of ID in biology).  Once the feature is seen under different lighting conditions, it is revealed for what it actually is: a big mountainous pile of Martian rocks.  It just so happened that – yes by blind, dumb luck – when the Viking probe flew over this section of Mars in 1976 it took a snapshot where the lighting conditions and manner in which shadows were projected gave the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of a face, when in fact no such face existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since come to think that basically any form of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/pareidol.html"&gt;pareidolia&lt;/a&gt; (of which the Face on Mars is a classic example) or similar optical illusions would be a wonderful way in which to test out the ID design inference model in a &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt; manner.  If there really is anything to it, then one would expect that the model would perform much better than chance.  You would also expect that in their desire to see ID treated as a valid science (and not merely the latest rehashed version of &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt;, which it is), the ID-proponents like Luskin &amp;amp; his fellows at the Discovery Institute would be falling all over themselves to run such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to my knowledge, they haven’t run these experiments.  Of course, this begs an obvious question: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; haven’t the ID-proponents themselves, who have been pushing ID as “real science” for over 20 years now, ever thought about proposing these kinds of tests?  Hmmm… interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; named Michelle Obama the &lt;a href="http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/michelle-obama-named-the-worlds-most-powerful-woman.html"&gt;world’s most powerful woman&lt;/a&gt;, beating out Hilary Clinton, Lady Gaga, and Sarah Palin. The magazine said that Mrs. Obama’s effectiveness as First Lady earned her the number one spot, including her Let’s Move campaign to battle childhood obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of Michelle Obama and the Let’s Move campaign, so we think that her #1 spot is well-deserved. Do you agree? Or who do you think deserves the position more?&lt;/p&gt;

He’s more than a bit skeptical of the multiverse idea, and somewhat contrarian about the low-entropy nature of the early universe: he thinks it’s just a fact we should observe and accept (”nomological”), rather than a feature that cries out for a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.secularstudents.org/files/newspapers.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 10px"&gt;We nontheists are becoming part of the media’s collective consciousness.  If you ever talk about, write about, or have any interest in atheism in America, you should seriously consider checking this out: the news service &lt;strong&gt;Religion Link&lt;/strong&gt; just released an incredible and extensive resource about the movement: &lt;a href="http://www.religionlink.com/tip_100921.php"&gt;Freethinkers: A source guide to atheists, humanists and other nontheists&lt;/a&gt;.  They put it together primarily to help journalists write stories about nontheism, but it can be valuable for anyone interested.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?  It’s a sign of the times – nontheism is gaining prominence.  We’re expecting our public presence to grow and we were all delighted to help develop the resource.  I’m in favor of anything that makes it easier for reporters to write accurate stories about us.  ReligionLink puts it well right near the beginning:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As America grapples with competing notions about its identity — Christian nation, pluralistic melting pot, secular society — an understanding of the country’s nontheists is vital. The concerns and influence of this segment of society seem destined to touch all Americans’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were a reporter, I would be salivating.  We’re a hot topic and this source guide gives movement history, story ideas, media contacts, survey data, past news articles about the movement, online communities, books published, and on and on…  The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (my organization) and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sent out a &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/freethoughtsourceguide"&gt;joint press release praising the guide&lt;/a&gt; and remarking on its significance:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Secular Americans will play an increasingly prominent role in the national discourse, and so this new resource is both welcome and necessary. In the media and in Washington we will increasingly speak out for human rights when they are infringed upon by the commingling of church and state,” said Sean Faircloth, Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America. “There are at least 30 million nontheistic Americans. That number is growing and the media wants to know more about us.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was initiated by the &lt;strong&gt;Stiefel Freethought Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;, the same organization that &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/20/stiefel-freethought-foundation-gives-grant-for-atheist-teens/"&gt;just gave the SSA a big grant&lt;/a&gt; to help us support more atheist teens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Said Foundation president Todd Stiefel, “The American public deserves the chance to get to know their nontheistic neighbors – their fellow Americans – and find that we are a community of loving, moral and joyful people. This resource can give journalists the tools they need to tell our story in full.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is particularly true for blocking lesions (chemical alterations that cannot be bypassed by DNA polymerases). Blocking lesions prevent amplification and sequencing of affected molecules, thus limiting the analysis of DNA derived from ancient samples. Heyn et al. recently developed a new method--polymerase extension profiling (PEP)--that reveals occurrences of polymerase stalling on DNA templates. This sequencing-based technology allows detection of damage on a single-molecule level. The technique used CircLigase™ ssDNA Ligase for high-efficiency ligation of single-stranded adaptors (containing the Roche 454 A sequence) to the 3’ ends of primer-extension products. 

The authors found evidence of blocking lesions in three out of four ancient samples, but no more than 40% of the molecules were affected, indicating that such modifications are far less frequent than previously thought.

Then one or two of my relatives brought him sacred objects for him to bless. One of the objects was the wooden cross that hung on our wall, similar to others hanging on Catholic walls in other Catholic homes, near the main entrance way to the house. It was hollow and included several items that would be used for the performance of either extreme unction (the "last rights") or, if necessary, an exorcism.

It was never very popular and never made much money but it's said to have influenced many other, more successful, bands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chad Orzel asks you to identify &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/10/who_is_the_velvet_underground.php"&gt;The Velvet Underground of Science&lt;/a&gt; by which he means an individual who isn't very famous but had a huge impact on science. Naturally, he has an example from physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have an example from molecular biology. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Delbr%C3%BCck"&gt;Max  Delbrück&lt;/a&gt; (1906-1981) was one of the founders of the 'phage school (along with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Luria"&gt;Salvador Luria&lt;/a&gt;). Delbrück began his science career as a physicist but when he went to the USA he switched to biology and soon became interested in bacteria and bacteriophage.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; During the 40s, 50s, and 60s he had a huge influence on the members of the 'phage group who used to meet regularly at Cold Spring Harbor where Delbrück taught a summer course in 'phage genetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim Watson, Matt Meselson, Franklin Stahl, Gunther Stent, Seymour Benzer, Edward Kellenberger, and Alfred Hershey are just a few of the scientists who were directly influenced by Delbrück. They all got together to contribute to &lt;i&gt;Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology&lt;/i&gt; in 1966. The book was a &lt;i&gt;Festschrift&lt;/i&gt; in honor of Max Delbrück on his 60th birthday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TK4qLxWi96I/AAAAAAAAKy4/6A84aID-wWc/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:326px;height:400px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TK4qLxWi96I/AAAAAAAAKy4/6A84aID-wWc/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There were many more second and third generation scientists who grew up in the 'phage group. My own supervisor used to refer frequently to Delbrück's "Principle of Limited Sloppiness" as an effective way of doing science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delbrück, Alfred D. Hershey, and Luria won the Nobel Prize in 1969 but he (Delbrück) is still not very well known among today's students. I think that every biochemistry and molecular biology student should have to read &lt;i&gt;The Eighth Day of Creation&lt;/i&gt; by Horace Freeland Judson in order to learn the history of their field. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They might discover that much of what they think of as "modern" was actually understood almost half a century ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Photo Credits: &lt;b&gt;Top:&lt;/b&gt; Delbrück in the early 1940s from &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Max_Delbruck.jpg"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Bottom:&lt;/b&gt; Delbrück and Luria at Cold Spring Harbor in 1953.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‘Madoff was just the human face of this lie that Wall Street told us and that we told one another — that the endless rise in everything we owned was too good to be true.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a kind of undernegation.  But I can't quite see what to do to put it right.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposition that the endless rise in everything we owned was too good to be true is not the lie; it&amp;#39;s the denial of the lie.  It&amp;#39;s the truth (we now know).  Somehow Arvedlund flipped from reporting what the lie was to reporting what the truth was — the truth that we should have been telling one another instead of repeating the lie.  The sentence is unquestionably an error: it doesn&amp;#39;t say what the speaker wanted to say. Yet you can&amp;#39;t easily repair it. Popping in a &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; at the obvious place gives you &lt;i&gt;…that the endless rise in everything we owned was not too good to be true&lt;/i&gt;, and the problem with that is that it still seems to imply that the endless rise managed to be true despite being good.  The explanation for the difficulty here is completely opaque to me.  I don't even know how to set out clearly what the problem is.  I need a negation expert; if only Larry Horn made house calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

He has used his position to continually attack scientist Michael Mann and his work done at the University of Virginia, claiming that Dr. Mann abused taxpayer money and knowingly used falsified data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuccinelli was essentially riding on the coattails of the now totally-discredited &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/30/the-global-warming-emails-non-event/"&gt;Climategate&lt;/a&gt; fiasco. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/04/global-warming-emails-followup/"&gt;You may remember &lt;/a&gt;how lots of people got very upset that scientists were sending emails to each other that, when taken grossly out of context and misinterpreted, made it look like those scientists were engaged in cooking the data. Once people looked a little more carefully, it became clear that no shenanigans were going on. Interestingly, although it was hugely covered in the media and by the usual antiscience mob in politics, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/07/01/climategates-death-rattle/"&gt;you hardly hear about Climategate anymore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cuccinelli can’t let it go. Even though his subpoena for documents from UVa &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/08/30/breaking-cuccinellis-climate-change-case-dismissed/"&gt;was dismissed by a judge&lt;/a&gt;, he retooled his claims and &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/10/virginia_attorney_general_ken_4.html?hpid=editorialpromo"&gt;is now demanding that the University hand over some emails from Mann to colleagues&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, he feels that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specifically, but without limitation, some of the conclusions of the papers demonstrate a complete lack of rigor regarding the statistical analysis of the alleged data, meaning that the result reported lacked statistical significance without a specific statement to that effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Michael Mann — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/05/breaking-climate-scientists-cleared-of-malpractice-by-panel/"&gt;who has been repeatedly cleared of wrongdoing despite many attempts to smear him and his work&lt;/a&gt; — sees the situation somewhat differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I find it extremely disturbing that Mr. Cuccinelli has sought to continue to abuse his power as the attorney general of Virginia in this way, in the process smearing the University of Virginia and me and other climate scientists,&amp;quot; Mann said. &amp;quot;The people of Virginia need to be extremely disturbed that he is using their tax dollars to pursue this partisan witch hunt.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree, and I’m glad he phrased it this way. Cuccinelli is claiming Mann abused taxpayer funds, but Cuccinelli is the one using taxpayer money to continue this attack which had little or no merit in the first place. Incidentally, Mann also says the narrowing of the claim by Cuccinelli &lt;em&gt;now targets a grant that isn’t even climate related&lt;/em&gt;. If Mann is correct, it sounds like Cuccinelli is on a fishing expedition, looking for anything he can use to discredit Mann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for Cuccinelli to admit defeat. Really, his attack should never have occurred; it over-reached in the first place, and the claims have been shown in other venues to be thin. The University rightly fought and continues to fight his efforts. They have said that what Cuccinelli is doing is creating a chilling effect on scientific research: by hounding scientists, it makes it harder for them to perform research in areas where they may get attacked by politically-motivated claims. The more Cuccinelli pursues this, the more it looks like the University is right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recently at the Disco-Tute’s propaganda blog they posted a piece about scientific consensus, prompted by &lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13669877.2010.511246"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; on the public reaction to scientific consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, by Dan Kahan et al., finds that the public may be sharply divided on factual questions about which the scientific community largely agrees, like evolution, global warming, and nuclear waste. The authors explored the reason for this disconnect and found that members of the public tend to form their beliefs about the existence of a scientific consensus based upon their cultural views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly reflects common experience – the acceptance or denial of the existence of a scientific consensus on man-made global warming &lt;a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-07/politics/global.warming.poll_1_global-warming-global-conference-national-poll?_s=PM:POLITICS"&gt;tracks with political ideology&lt;/a&gt;. It seems unlikely that individuals are mostly making independent and rational assessments of the scientific evidence, and just happen to be coming up with the conclusion that is favored by the ideological culture in which they are embedded. It is a common conceit, however, that one’s own views are rationally evidence-based, and it is the other side that is ideological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is not a symmetrical phenomenon. Some ideologies may have little or no impact on certain scientific questions, while others may have a dominant impact on the same questions. Therefore, on specific issues some ideologies may be more “free” to simply follow the scientific consensus, while others will have a firmly pre-determined bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the relationship between science and consensus is a complex one. I &lt;a href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=388"&gt;discuss that relationship at length here&lt;/a&gt;, and so will not repeat those points. (Do read the other article if you want to delve into that issue further.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the current study shows is that when the scientific consensus conflicts with ideological belief, most people will happily reject the consensus. At such times there are readily available excuses for such rejection – scientists are wrong sometimes, scientists are people too and have their own biases, the media is mis-reporting the state of the science, or the scientific community is dominated by conflicts of interest (from government, industry, or professional protectionism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a kernel of truth to all of these accusations, making them all the more powerful as rationalizations. However, often they are invoked ad hoc to justify an ideological belief, rather than in reaction to an independent assessment of the overall impact of such factors on a specific question. Throw in a little confirmation bias – and it’s easy to see how the public can be so polarized over what are essentially empirical questions that should be objectively resolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the  Disco-Tute does not appear to be interested in a fair assessment of scientific consensus. They are an ideological organization, and so need to defend their ad hoc dismissal of scientific consensus whenever it suits their needs. In response to the Kahan study, they write (there is no specific author listed for this article):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that special?  So if you’re a Darwin doubter it’s not  because you’ve thought through the issue for yourself and come to a  heterodox conclusion. You’re just a sheep, following what your hick  friends and neighbors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That statement is intended to be sarcastic, but is actually more ironic, because in a way it is exactly correct. Another  possible interpretation is that every evolution denier (or at least most) came to a thoughtful, but horribly wrong, conclusion about the scientific evidence. It is extremely unlikely that independent scientific conclusions would track so closely with religious beliefs and political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, the other possibility is that it is those who accept the consensus on evolution who are influenced by ideology, while religious conservatives are being scientifically objective. Or maybe the evidence is inconclusive, leaving everyone to follow their biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full discussion of the scientific merits of evolution are beyond this post, so suffice it to say I have written before on aspects of the evidence for evolution and arguments against it. The evidence for the fact of evolution is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just my opinion, it is the overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion. But of course, the Disco-tute has an answer for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice, however, the utter naïveté of the study and report. Basically,  Professor Kahan et al. say that people in the general public tend to  count a scientist as an expert if that scientist supports the views of  the group the individual belongs to. But they treat the scientists  themselves as if they aren’t a part of the general public and so don’t  have the same bias. Apparently, scientists alone are immune to the bias  detected in the study that is otherwise unbiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is missing a major premise of the study, however – that on certain issues the scientific community is united on one conclusion while the public is divided on the same issue. The public is divided because they are generally following their ideology and biases, and the scientific community is united because they are generally following scientific evidence and logic. That is a crucial point – the scientific community is united behind a solid consensus, despite the fact that they do range the spectrum of ideological biases just like the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual scientists may be biased by their beliefs and ideology, and there are always dissenters and outliers. But science has a process, with rules of logic and evidence. That’s kinda the point of science. And it is reasonable to believe that trained scientists are likely to have a better appreciation for the process of science, and the details of the findings of science, than the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Disco-tute would have you believe that the scientific opinions of the average citizen are just as reliable as the consensus of opinion of experts who have spent years or decades studying scientific methodology and their particular fields in great depth and detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they need to perpetuate that notion because their job is to deny well-established science in the name of their particular ideology.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286481487849"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7328">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bffdec0ced2ade63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Do you have low T?</title><published>2010-10-07T16:46:01Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T16:46:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7328" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you google “low testosterone” you’ll see lots of ads for testosterone replacement.  Some are &lt;a href="http://www.isitlowt.com/"&gt;from pharmaceutical companies&lt;/a&gt; that sell testosterone, others from obvious snake-oil salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both types of ads list vague sets of symptoms, encourage you to believe that they are pathologic, and want to sell you something to make you better.  For example, the pharmaceutical company Solvay gives you a handy guide for speaking to your doctor, and a quiz to see if you have “low T”.  The quiz asks some questions that may be useful, but also asks very general questions about your sense of well being, and includes this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel sick, I just don’t feel like myself anymore. Could I have Low T?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad then gives this advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Low T signs and symptoms may not be clear and apparent, they may seem to be a normal part of aging or assumed to be caused by other health conditions. But talk to your doctor if you have symptoms of Low T. And ask to get tested. All it takes is a simple blood test that can be done during a routine checkup. If you do have Low T, your doctor may recommend treatments that can help bring testosterone up to normal levels and keep them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, you should ask your doctor for a Low T test. The Endocrine Society recommends that all men with type 2 diabetes have their testosterone levels checked. Patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes have an increased chance of also having Low T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back for a moment.  What is being claimed is that low testosterone levels in males is a common cause of certain symptoms, and that testosterone replacement therapy can alleviate these symptoms.  To evaluate this claim from the perspective of science-based medicine, we need to ask specific questions.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a plausible connection between testosterone levels and certain symptoms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a normal testosterone level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there specific symptoms that correlate with lower levels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does replacement therapy correct these symptoms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is an important hormone in males, and the effects of complete testosterone deprivation are easily observed.  Castration has different effects on males depending on whether it is done before puberty or after.  Given the effect of total androgen (testosterone) deprivation, it is plausible that partial deficiency may lead to physiologic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining normal testosterone levels is problematic though.  Most studies show a decline in testosterone levels with age.  What is “normal” at 30 is not “normal” at 70.  Does this decline correlate with symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11836290"&gt;&lt;img title="Decline in testoterone with age" src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/chaneTtime-300x155.jpg" alt="Decline in testosterone level with age" width="300" height="155"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decline in testosterone level with age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer isn’t clear.  Studies have shown that low testosterone levels are associated with different symptoms at different ages.  In older men with sexual dysfunction, low testosterone levels were associated with severe erectile dysfunction and decreased frequency of intercourse.  In younger men, low testosterone levels were associated with a decrease in nocturnal erections and reduced libido.  In the middle of the studied age  range, there were no significant associations between testosterone levels and sexual symptoms.  What this may tell us is that in older men, low levels of testosterone likely contribute to severe symptoms of sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to question 2 is that normal testosterone levels vary with age, the type of test used, and the time of day the blood is drawn. Testosterone decreases with age, and this decrease correlates with certain symptoms.    Because of these and other data, the recommendation of the Endocrine Society (the most comprehensive and authoritative source) is to restrict the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency to men who have consistent symptoms and an unequivocally low testosterone level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 3 has a difficult answer.  As we’ve seen, in certain age groups, certain sexual symptoms correlate well with low T levels.   There are some weak associations between less specific symptoms and testosterone deficiency (symptoms such as fatigue, loss of vigor, depressed mood, decreased physical performance).  Most of these less specific symptoms can be caused by a variety of problems or by none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the data support a connection between certain symptoms and low testosterone levels.  Can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) improve these symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is mixed.  There seems to be good evidence that testosterone replacement improves libido, but has little effect on erectile dysfunction (especially in younger patients).  There is a paucity of placebo-controlled studies of TRT, but non-placebo-controlled trials show some improvements in energy and sense of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several medical conditions are correlated with low T. Obesity fairly strongly correlated with low testosterone levels, but there are no consistent data that show an improvement in obesity with TRT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, testosterone deficiency is a real problem that may affect a small but significant number of men.  The symptoms most consistent with low T are sexual problems, especially with age.  Replacement therapy seems to help with these symptoms in some men.  The ads for testosterone replacement therapy are, in my opinion, very problematic, nearing the point of deception.  They seem to link all manner of vague and common symptoms to low T, and imply that the use of their product is likely to fix these problems.   These ads explicitly instruct patients to ask for testing that may not actually be required. They shift the focus from a careful, methodical analysis of a difficult problem to frank disease mongering, encouraging the pathologizing of what may be normal symptoms, and offering up a costly therapy that may be no better than placebo, but with additional risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, you all did a great job, so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s question comes courtesy of reader and regular commenter &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/#comment-111082"&gt;davew&lt;/a&gt;. He asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do skeptics make good politicians? Would you like to see a skeptic run your country? Is there any chance of this happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to be sure we meet the lofty standards of what  &lt;em&gt;The New and Improved Ass Kicking Thursday Afternoon Afternoon Inquisition&lt;/em&gt;should be, davew offers a bonus question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the least likely/most unusual thing you have taken a skeptical approach to? (In davew’s case, he says it was his lawn. Story please, davew.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bothered by My Green Conscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0px!important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=officepolitic-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0865716463" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt; is the story of my true-life adventures in going green. It includes the  story of us selling our only car (an SUV), winning approval from  Toronto City Hall for the right to build a green driveway (and actually  building it as a long weekend DIY project), rediscovering eccentric  glamour in my own closet, understanding the real poop on social change,  and also writing a visual letter to my future Grandkids in 2020, and  wondering how they will judge us. The collection of five visual essays  was published as a 160-page full color book by New Society Publishers in April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I really enjoyed flipping through this creative account of climate change and personal decisions.

Myers&lt;/a&gt; have noted, in conjunction with others, that there may be an insidious connection between climate-change denialist David Koch, who largely funded the Smithsonian’s new human evolution exhibit, and the contents of the exhibit itself.  (Greg doesn’t buy it.)  After I learned that Koch was a denialist, I drew a connection between one or two of the displays I saw and Koch’s views.  And according to &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/08/24/new-yorker-koch-brothers-smithsonian-tea-party/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate Progress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I missed other exhibits showing how wonderful climate change was for our evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I read about this kerfuffle, I was going to put up these pictures as examples of some of the wonky views on evolution on offer in the exhibit, but now I see that they may have a more insidious meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the exhibit, I noted that there was considerable unfounded speculation about the influence of climate change on evolution.  Here’s a display suggesting—and there is NO evidence for this—that adaptation to changing climate was a major force propelling the evolutionary increase in human brain size. Note, at the lower right, the two graphs showing a “coordinated” increase of human brain size with increasing variability of climate (click the picture to enlarge and read the captions). Note also that as the fluctuations in temperature increased, the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; temperature also decreased, so there’s no way, at least from these data, to separate brain evolution from average temperature versus erratic temperature.  And of course there are tons of other hypotheses, not connected with climate, to explain why our brains got bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-20004" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/more-on-climate-change-and-the-smithsonian-exhibition/p1000301/"&gt;&lt;img title="P1000301" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/p1000301.jpg?w=546&amp;amp;h=408" alt="" width="546" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This display, while not as scientifically unfounded as the one above, is still speculative, without any indication that there’s no solid proof that human body morphology reflects adaptation to climate.  It’s a good guess, but we don’t know for sure and, at any rate, since the theme of the exhibit is “how do we know what we know?”, the curators should have injected a cautionary note about the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-20008" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/more-on-climate-change-and-the-smithsonian-exhibition/p1000300-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="P1000300" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/p10003001.jpg?w=545&amp;amp;h=408" alt="" width="545" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smithsonian, j’accuse!  Get your curators in there and expunge all the questionable “science” tying our evolution to climate change.  And call a spade a spade: if something is just a hypothesis, label it as such rather than implying it’s settled fact.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a new article out on the subject by a team led by University of Montana researchers and the US Army Chemical Biological center.  Using proteomic sequencing, they found two culprits in the bodies of dead bees: invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV), a long-stranded DNA virus, and Nosema, a fungal spore.  Both had been detected in bees found dead of CCD before, but here they showed that affected bees were most likely to have both pathogens working in concert.

It&amp;#39;s an encouraging development.  However, I&amp;#39;d like to point out that news coverage that emphasizes the &amp;quot;we found it!&amp;quot; narrative misses the important lessons that have come out of the CCD experience.  Previous researchers had predicted that the cause of CCD would not likely be a new pathogen but a combination of interacting effects, and pointed out that the rise of highly technical, industrialized monoculture beekeeping in the U.S. had left bee-pollinated agriculture vulnerable to new combinations such as these.   The effects of pesticides, stress, and the mass trucking of bee populations around the country are still unknown but likely exacerbate the effects of pests, new and old.

If we can protect bees from IIV and Nosema, great.  However, it is just as important to build resilience and diversity into our agricultural system so as to reduce the risks associated with unknown future diseases.  Otherwise we will be unprepared for the next CCD that will inevitably come.

In summary, these pieces detect a much more sinister motivation for Koch’s funding of the exhibit, flowing from his global warming denialism. As I’d noted in the comments on my piece, there is material about climate change in the exhibit, but nothing I regarded as untoward. The scale of climate change discussed in the exhibit– tens of thousands to millions of years– doesn’t seem relevant to the decade to century scale of current warming. And, there is, as far as I saw, no discussion of current warming in the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Koch wanted the point made that climate does change, and that this influenced human evolution– that’s true of course– and he hoped that, by &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;, visitors would conclude that recent rapid climate change is nothing to worry about. But that is a &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;, and a fairly subtle one at that, so I’m not sure he’s getting his money’s worth. I’ll let Climate Progress make the argument for its view in their video.&lt;/p&gt;

In many of these cases, the law comes down fairly hard, but in this case, the family gets little more than a slap on the wrist. According to the article, the heads of the family that led the exorcism received&lt;blockquote&gt;six months' community detention and a daily curfew. In addition they had to do 300 hours community work and 12 months' supervision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I've always understood the purpose of punishments to be a deterrent for future actions (as well as, frequently, compensation for damages from past ones). But this sentence is so light, it doesn't effectively serve either purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the judge in his sentencing remarks, doesn't even condemn the base practice of dangerous exorcisms themselves. Instead, he recommends that before carrying them out, people seek the advice of cult practitioners, as if they're somehow any more qualified:&lt;blockquote&gt;But what can be stated is that tohunga or kaumatua should be consulted by whanau where makutu is suspected so that the whanau receive the correct expert advice as to how to deal with a situation, as such advice will be tempered by ensuring what is to be carried out by such exorcism remains within the laws of New Zealand as set down by Parliament&lt;/blockquote&gt;So apparently, if you kill someone by consulting the proper quack, New Zealand is fine with it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-7978636281372446923?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"

href="http://brainposts.blogspot.com/2010/10/cannabis-use-and-psychosis.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There is growing interest in the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis.  Epidemiologic studies support higher rates of cannabis use in those that develop psychosis, but this could just be an association finding rather than a causal effect.  For example, a genetic factor that increases risk for psychosis could also increase risk for cannabis use.   Alternatively, subtle pre-psychosis onset symptoms may increase risk for the use of cannabis—cannabis may be used to treat some premorbid symptoms of psychosis.  Additionally, epidemiologic studies can be confounded by unmeasured variables. I have to admit that I started out in the skeptical camp for a significant link between cannabis use and psychosis.  But recent evidence is making me re-think this issue and the complexity of the relationship.  Two research studies have recently added important understanding to the issue.McGrath and colleagues in Australia used a sibling pair analysis to examine the effect of cannabis use on later psychotic symptoms.  Sibling pairs provide a strategy to attempt to minimize the potential for unmeasured confounding variables.Three thousand eight hundred and one young adults born between 1981 and 1984 were followed and assessed.  Cannabis use was assessed and psychosis was measured in three domains:Presence of a non-affective psychosis (i.e. schizophrenia)Presence of hallucinationsScore on a inventory of delusions (Delusions Inventory score) Subjects with six years or more since cannabis use were examined for the key psychosis domains with the following results:Odds ratios elevated for all three domains in the sample as a whole (non-affective psychosis odds ratio 2.2, presence of hallucinations odds ratio 2.8 and scoring highest quartile of delusion odds ratio 4.2)When only the sib pairs were examined the relationship between duration since first use and delusions inventory remained significant—this supports a true relationship not confounded by unmeasured variablesAnother study from the Netherlands adds insight into the relationship between cannabis and psychosis.  The study used two designs a sibling-non-sibling control and a cross sibling comparison.  Cannabis use in this study was assessed by urinalysis and a lifetime frequency of use instrument.  Psychosis in this study included a structured interview for schizotypy and the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences.   The key findings from this study included:Siblings currently using cannabis  were much more likely than controls to  show sensitivity to positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. hallucinations/delusions)Siblings using cannabis with a relative with psychosis showed increased positive psychotic symptomatology compared to siblings not using cannabis The authors note the double design study supports a interpretation that “genetic risk for psychotic disorder may be expressed in part as sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effect of cannabis”.  In other words, familial psychosis risk is moderated through a sensitivity to psychotic symptoms with cannabis.  Their findings are less supportive of a role for familial psychotic risk to increase the use of cannabis (mediation).I interpret these studies to indicate that for the population as a whole, cannabis use may have a very limited effect on risk of psychosis.  However, if you carry a familial (genetic) risk for psychosis, cannabis use may potentiate that risk.  This potentiation may depend in part on the quantity and duration of use as well as which brain developmental period use begins.  Heavy adolescent onset use may be the most concerning period of vulnerability in those with a genetic risk for psychosis.  Experiencing psychotic symptoms with cannabis use may be a marker for increased risk for a later persistent psychotic disorders.   The take home messages for clinicians—1.) patients with a family history of psychosis should not use cannabis, 2.) patients experiencing psychotic symptoms with cannabis use should be educated that this is not a good sign and they may be most vulnerable to psychosis with continued heavy use.Photo of Signage on San Antonio Riverwalk Courtesy of Yates PhotographyMcGrath J, Welham J, Scott J, Varghese D,

An explanation is at hand, though: his &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/08/24/new-yorker-koch-brothers-smithsonian-tea-party/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; issue is denying the significance of global climate change, and the exhibit is tailored to make climate change look like a universal good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some convincing examples of the subterfuge being perpetrated. There is a big emphasis on how evolutionary changes were accompanied by (or even caused by) climate shifts, which evolutionary biologists would see as almost certainly true, and so it slides right past us. But, for instance, what they do is illustrate the temperature changes in a graph covering the last 10 million years, which makes it easy to hide the very abrupt and rapid rise in the last few centuries. They also elide over an obvious fact: we'd rather not experience natural selection. Climate change may have shaped our species, but it did so by &lt;i&gt;killing&lt;/i&gt; us, by pushing populations around on the map, by famine and disease, by conflict and chaos. Evolution happened. That doesn't mean we liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it wouldn't leap out at an evolutionary biologist because it is true: there have been temperature fluctuations and long term changes that have hit our species hard, and nobody is denying it. However, it's a bit of a stretch to suggest that we should therefore look forward to melting icecaps and flooding seaboards and intensified storms. It's probably also worth pointing out that our technological civilization is certainly more fragile than anything we've had before. The fact that we could be knocked back to a stone age level of technology without going extinct is not a point in favor of welcoming global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a new question: how did this devious agenda get past the directors of the Smithsonian?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/so_thats_why_koch_funded_a_maj.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jMYG5LmhC_s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286475080818"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/son_of_behe_talks_about_his_at.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57837c620a749dd2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Son of Behe Talks about his Atheism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good day Richard, my name is Ken and I have never been a strong believer in a Deity. As a kid my mom did teach us to believe in God, but over my 36 years on earth, I have seen and been a part of some really sad and unbelievable things, which have forced me to open my mind and now I feel like believing is like believing in a fairytale. My only big issue is that I have a new baby girl and I am so worried about something happening to her that I want to believe I could pray to save her from suffering. My family is okay with my feelings, and I know that there are no answers for why things happen. But the situation I am in now is like the whole “there are no Atheists in the trenches” saying. I am so scared for my baby girl that I want to believe in something that may help me to understand if something did happen or to simply be able to ask for her protection. I know my message is a bit brain scattered, but I hope you can help me to be okay with my thoughts and my fears for my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Ken,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have discovered, having a child means having your heart running around outside of your body for the rest of your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m scared for my daughter too, although it has diminished over the last 25 years. It was sheer helpless terror at first; now it’s just a slight sigh-producing worry. We are confronted with the utter vulnerability of these tiny, beautiful creatures who lie asleep full length on our forearms, and that brings on a heightened awareness of the likely, the possible, and the improbable dangers they may face. Suddenly we’re on full adrenalin alert, as if waking to the growl of a predator just outside our cave’s entrance.  We fear our weapons and strength are inadequate; our confidence feels thin.  The urge to call upon a parent figure of our own is powerful. Our earthly parents are ordinary people, or they are aging and frail, or they are gone. So it’s very tempting to call upon an imaginary super-parent for protection or for solace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that you’ll be able to talk yourself into believing again just to have that false comfort, and I get the impression that you realize that too. You’d always know that you were kidding yourself. Once we see things in the light of day, our eyes adjust, and we can’t return to believing in vague shadows, as soothing as their stories might be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are experiencing the difference between what our rational minds tell us and what our emotions insist of us, and the distance that can open up between those two things.  Intellectually, you know that the comfort, reassurance and confidence that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come from believing in a deity would be an illusion only, like the confidence that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come from a few beers before facing a danger. Perhaps we feel a little better, but it has left us  either no more capable of actually handling things, or  even less capable. No, we need &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; courage, not what comes from a bottle or a fairytale. Real courage is not fearlessness. It is doing what must be done despite our fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have real courage, Ken. You have already demonstrated it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is for the brave. Attaching ourselves to another person is an act of courage. We know that there will be loss and pain eventually.  With our love partners, breaking up, divorce, or death are the inevitable price we know we will pay for the joy we gain from their company, yet we choose to accept it.   With our children, the risk is greater and the emotional stakes are higher, yet we choose to accept it.  We take life as a whole package, joy and grief, and now all of that is compressed into this tiny, wiggling, fragile package that we cradle in our arms.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot keep straddling that widening gap between what our heads and our hearts dictate, like standing astride a boat and a dock. We have to step onto either one or the other. Those who choose the side of rational thinking still have their feelings, so they must console, confer, confide, counsel, and comfort with other rational people. These fathers and mothers talk to their fellow fathers and mothers, frankly sharing their thoughts, fears and hopes, trading their untried suggestions and well-practiced solutions, and letting each other know that they have similar feelings. Through this, they find that their weapons and strength seem at least a little less inadequate, and they’re willing to face down whatever is growling in the dark outside the cave.  They do the job of parents, and they do it with the mutual support and encouragement of their fellows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken, your daughter is a very lucky girl. She has a brave, sensitive, loving, thoughtful dad, who cares very much about being the best dad he can be. You can use your anxiety as a drive instead of it being a handicap. Find other dads and moms with whom you can talk about your feelings, parents who &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; their way through challenges instead of hoping, like children, that some higher parent will handle it for them. You’ll find that you’re not alone in how you feel, and you’ll hear some very useful suggestions and encouragement.  When you’re hurting or afraid, they will be real and solid comrades there to comfort you as well. As time goes on, and your daughter in her turn grows strong and confident under your tutelage, your fear will slowly wear down to a slight, sigh-producing worry.  It will leave its mark of honor on you; the lines that fathers permanently wear on their brows are badges of courage.&lt;/p&gt;

Check out Razib's postings: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/arise-the-vehicle-arise-the-cell/"&gt;Arise the vehicle! Arise the cell!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/epigenetics-what-revolution/"&gt;Epigenetics – what revolution?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The article in question is by Steve Talbott&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and it's published in &lt;i&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-delusion"&gt;Getting Over the Code Delusion&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how the editors introduce the article ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s Note:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first in a planned set of essays by Mr. Talbott explaining the significance of a revolution in genetics and molecular biology that has only just begun to receive public attention. Although this essay is at times necessarily tech­nical, we trust that our readers will not find it prohibitively so — and we have appended a modest and informal glossary to help smooth the path.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You all know where this is going, don't you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talbot sets up his "revolution" by describing several problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;A number of conundrums have helped to nudge molecular biology toward a more contextualized understanding of the gene. To begin with, the Human Genome Project revised the human gene count downward from 100,000 to 20,000–25,000. What made the figure startling was the fact that much simpler creatures — for example, a tiny, transparent ­roundworm — were found to have roughly the same number of genes. More recently, researchers have turned up a pea aphid with 34,600 genes and a water flea with 39,000 genes. Not even the "chimps are human" boosters were ready to set themselves on the same scale with a water flea. The difference in gene counts required some sort of shift in ­understanding.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I've addressed this before. Knowledgeable experts in the field were predicting 30,000 genes at least as far back as the late 1960s. Their predictions were very close to the mark [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/06/false-history-and-number-of-genes.html"&gt;False History and the Number of Genes&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/humans-have-only-20500-protein-encoding.html"&gt;Humans Have Only 20,500 Protein-Encoding Genes&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/03/facts-and-myths-concerning-historical.html"&gt;Facts and Myths Concerning the Historical Estimates of the Number of Genes in the Human Genome&lt;/a&gt;]. Steve Talbot hasn't done his homework. This isn't a very auspicious beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;A second oddity centered on the fact that, upon "deciphering" the genetic Book of Life, we found that our coding scheme made the vast bulk of it read like nonsense. That is, some 95 or 98 percent of human DNA was useless for making proteins. Most of this "noncoding DNA" was at first dismissed as "junk" — meaningless evolutionary detritus accumulated over the ages. At best, it was viewed as a kind of bag of spare parts, borne by cells from one generation to another for possible employment in future genomic innovations. But that’s an awful lot of junk for a cell to have to lug around, duplicate at every cell division, and otherwise manage on a continuing basis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this day and age, anyone who equates junk DNA with non-coding DNA isn't worth reading. They've lost all credibility as far as I'm concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talbott explains the solution later on in his article when he says ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;So what’s going on? These puzzles turn out to be intimately related. As organisms rise on the evolutionary scale, they tend to have more "junk DNA." Noncoding DNA accounts for some 10 percent of the genome in many one-celled organisms, 75 percent in roundworms, and 98 percent in humans. The ironic suspicion became too obvious to ignore: maybe it’s precisely our "junk" that differentiates us from water fleas. Maybe what counts most is not so much the genes themselves as the way they are regulated and expressed. Noncoding DNA could provide the complex regulatory functions that direct genes toward service of the organism’s needs, including its developmental needs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who states or implies that there is a significant correlation between total haploid genome size and species complexity is either ignorant or lying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larry Moran&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/09/genome-size-complexity-and-c-value.html"&gt;Genome Size, Complexity, and the C-Value Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"Organism rise on the evolutionary scale"? Has Talbott done any research at all for this article? His understanding of evolution is no greater than kindergarten level if he believes that there's an evolutionary scale with us near the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea that noncoding DNA contains sequences that govern gene expression has been with us for fifty years. That's hardly revolutionary. The idea that the amount of junk DNA in a genome equates to complexity has been soundly disproven. The idea that humans might need a million base pairs of DNA to control expression of every gene is ludicrous and has absolutely no evidence to support it. In fact, nobody I know has ever shown that mammalian genes require more regulatory sequences than insect genes or those of crustaceans (water fleas). What we have here is a perfect example of &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/05/deflated-ego-problem.html"&gt;The Deflated Ego Problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about the third "conundrum"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another conundrum — perhaps the most decisive one — has been recognized and wrestled with (or more often just ignored) since the early twentieth century. With few exceptions, every different type of cell in the human body contains the same chromosomes and the same DNA sequence as the original, single-celled zygote. Yet somehow this zygote manages to differentiate into every manner of tissue — liver, skin, muscle, brain, blood, bone, retina, and so on. If genes determine the form and substance of the organism, how is it that such radically different cellular architectures result from the same genes? What directs genes to produce the intricately sculpted and differentiated form of a complex organism, and how can this directing agency be governed by the very genes that it directs?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;We've known the basic answer to this "conundrum" for about five decades. Talbott's idea of a revolution is very strange. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't bother reading the article in &lt;i&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/i&gt;. There's nothing "new" there and it may make you very angry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt; In the locker room, she was subjected to whistles and catcalls, eventually &lt;u&gt;tweeting&lt;/u&gt; that she was avoiding eye contact with players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tweet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an invented verb, so it provides an interesting little experiment in syntactic change.  It takes content clauses with the subordinator &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, as the above example shows.  Can it take a direct object plus content clause, like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;tell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;She told him that she was leaving&lt;/i&gt;?  Apparently so: if you Google for &lt;i&gt;tweeted him that she&lt;/i&gt;, you get about 3,400 Google hits.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about an optional &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; Preposition Phrase, like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;She said to him that she was leaving&lt;/i&gt;?  That too, and perhaps more commonly: for both &lt;i&gt;tweeted to his fans that…&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tweeted to her fans that…&lt;/i&gt;, you get more than 7,000 hits.  And what of ditransitive use (with two object noun phrases), like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;tell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;She told him the news&lt;/i&gt;?  That seems to be developing as well: there are 13,400 hits for &lt;i&gt;tweeted him the&lt;/i&gt;, some of which are spurious (in &lt;i&gt;she just tweeted him the other day&lt;/i&gt; the noun phrase is a time modifier, not a second object), but many of which are genuine (in &lt;i&gt;I tweeted him the link to my post&lt;/i&gt; we have two objects). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see the point?  Twitter merely coined a verb meaning "send a message via Twitter", but they didn't specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities.  They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn't specify its grammar.  The verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;tweet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.  That is a really interesting, though unintended, large-scale natural experiment in how syntactic change works.  And it is running right now, every minute of every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Instead, we should ridicule them.&amp;quot;.  I do not know the context of this quote and I would appreciate it if anyone who was actually there could expand on it. Dr. Dawkins said this during his interview with Michael Shermer at an event at Cal Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As a stand-alone comment it, bring up an issue that has had many people in the skeptical community at odds for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does ridicule &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; work?

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At TAM 8 this past July, Phil Plaitt gave his now famous &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/13704095"&gt;“Don’t Be A D!ck”&lt;/a&gt; speech. He posed the following question, asking for a show of hands, “How many of you came to skepticism because someone called you a moron?” A few people did raise their hands in the affirmative but it was a very small group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His point was that when people feel they are being insulted, they tend to shut out logical arguments and revert to a defensive stance. Nobody enjoys being ridiculed for beliefs whether they are deeply held or not. Usually what happens is the person who feels insulted and attacked ends up clinging to that belief even harder than before. They also walk away with the idea that all skeptics are jerks. No one wins in that scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attitude that believers should be ridiculed is divisive and harmful to our cause as a group. If the goal is to build and expand our skeptical community, using &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html"&gt;Ad Hominem&lt;/a&gt; attacks only drives potential skeptics away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we as a group need to consider the possibility that the person you are getting ready to call a moron may not ever have been exposed to critical thinking. Their ideas seem perfectly plausible to them because they may not have been taught that what they saw was really a weather balloon or that there is such a thing as sleep paralysis. They may not know what pareidolia is or that the autonomic nervous system makes them twitch when they’re dowsing for water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is the answer, not ridicule. Asking someone “Have you thought it could be this?” instead of calling names is so much more productive. Engage them in conversation about their belief. Pose questions that will get them to think about other possible answers and then let them come to their own conclusion. Sometimes they come back later and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, ridicule &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; have a place. Using humor to diffuse a tense situation can point out the ridiculousness of a belief. A joke has the potential to plant seeds of doubt in someone who is ready to hear it. A wonderful example of using humor to ridicule a belief can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/22/super-heroes-vs-the-westboro-baptist-church/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where people at this year’s ComicCon put on a counter-protested against the Westboro Baptist. Church protestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Teller have also had success with an In-Your-Face approach on their Showtime program, Bullshit. That show is one of the reasons I’m a skeptic. They have a no-nonsense tack to pseudo science and quackery. They also use tastelessness and humor to diffuse a tense situation. But lets face it; their approach is much more like a kick to the groin than a pat on the back. It can be (and has been) off-putting to viewers whose beliefs have been called into question. The difficulty with a TV show is that, aside from the P&amp;amp;T message boards, there is no one there to answer questions that might crop up during the show.&lt;/p&gt;
While the ridicule approach does have a minimal level of success, when we go after the &lt;b&gt;idea&lt;/b&gt; and not the person, we have the potential to create a meaningful dialog where change actually has the potential to take place.  
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to understand, also, that everyone is at a different point in the exploration of skepticism. We’re overcoming millions of years of evolution by learning to think critically. Our brains simply aren’t wired that way. Learning new ways of thinking is difficult and when &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/cognitivedissonance.html"&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt; enters the picture, there can be actual, physical discomfort along with the emotional and mental stress of walking away from long-held beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
Patience, education and humor are tools that we might consider adding to our skeptical toolbox. It takes patience to educate people who have not been exposed to or are new to critical thinking. Have a strategy in mind before engaging in a debate over a belief. George Hrab has an excellent one. When confronted with pseudoscience, he asks, “Really? And how does that work?”. Engage them. Get them to explain the belief. Asking for an explanation gets the person to think about what they are proposing especially if you gently point out other possibilities by asking “What if…?”. You probably won’t get them to change their mind during the discussion and that shouldn’t be the goal. Even though you’re probably right, this isn’t about being right.  It’s about planting a seed.</summary><author><name>mblanford@randi.org (Maria Myrback)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286467982288"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/the_meme_of_honourable_death_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9bcbf5cc9891aa35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The meme of honourable death</title><published>2010-10-07T16:59:57Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T16:59:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/u8GhMHr9gHY/the_meme_of_honourable_death_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/the_meme_of_honourable_death_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Anglo Boer War (in what is now South Africa from October 11th, 1899 to May 31st, 1902) was a turning point in European style military history.  In previous centuries, infantry would operate in large blocks that would move forward, turn and open or close ranks, and winning an infantry engagement would involve getting your columns around the side or back of the enemy's columns, or simply overrunning them head on.  This worked in part because although everybody had a firearm of some kind, the firearms of the 18th century and in some areas well into the 19th century held one bullet, took time to reload, and were inaccurate, and since they tended to be inaccurate, the soldiers were generally not trained to shoot as well as they might. So, a rifle was really a spear (with a bayonet attached, of course) that also made a lot of noise and fired a few relatively useless bullets.  Previously, a highly mobile well trained cavalry was effective under the right conditions because it consisted of swordsmen up on big and/or fast horses who could move quickly across the landscape and would wade into the enemy's infantry slicing up the foot soldiers.  The cavalry could not be stopped easily by the infantry because the  infantry would shoot a relatively small number of relatively bogus bullets at the cavalry, knock a few guys off a few horses, then get ripped to shreds with the swords.  The fact that the cavalry often consisted of members of the elite classes and the infantry consisted mainly of working class men made it all the more ... Victorian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billed as the “Mythbusters of the Paranormal,” a title coveted but undeserved by every paranormal show in existence, &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files&lt;/i&gt; supposedly “revolutionizes paranormal programming by investigating the evidence witnesses post on the Internet every day. Have you ever seen a photo or video online and wondered, 'Is this real?' This is the show that will answer that question.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does the show answer that question correctly, and truthfully? And is the very question honest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show examines paranormal claims found online, to determine whether the phenomenon captured is, well, “fact or faked.” As we will see, it seems the producers are the ones doing the faking.&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt;The investigative team is comprised of amateur “experts.” There is Ben, the former FBI agent; Jael, the journalist; Larry, the special effects guy; Austin, the stuntman; Chi-Lin, the photography expert; and Bill, the “scientist.” All boast a background in paranormal research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the team’s research methods are questionable. Quite rightly, their approach is to recreate anomalous phenomena, but they often recreate the phenomena badly, or recreate phenomena that are irrelevant. They mistake scientific tools for the scientific method. They aren’t familiar with basic principles of skepticism, such as Ockham’s razor. In their conclusions, the unexplained becomes the “inexplicable” and the team often appeal to supernatural explanations over natural ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But determining whether footage is “fact or faked” still doesn’t determine whether it’s paranormal or not. Even if the phenomenon and filming is legitimate and not staged, that doesn’t presuppose that it is paranormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in one episode, the team visits Fishers, Indiana, to investigate a “Cemetery Phantom”. The evidence featured footage of a bright light, and increased EMF activity near the tombstone of a Civil War soldier. To examine the case the team devises some experiments to reproduce the effects, and collect some examples of Electronic Voice Phenomena (recordings of alleged spirits). They theorize that the original video is evidence of paranormal phenomena, and conclude that the film had captured either the “ghost of a civil war soldier” or a “ghost train” because the cemetery is located near a former railroad crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it takes them 30 minutes to falsely prove, it takes one scientific paranormal investigator 3 minutes to disprove. Doctor Atlantis aka Blake Smith of the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/"&gt;Monster Talk podcast&lt;/a&gt; examined the footage and the theories and produced his own skeptical analysis.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; For all of the team’s elaborate tests and elaborate theories, they never once review the clip in slow motion. In doing so, Smith revealed that the unearthly “train” was an earthly spider on a web. “Oh what a tangled web we weave…when we run around in the dark with video cameras,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on the show’s online forums hundreds of viewers deduced that the footage revealed a spider, and overall they criticize the show’s research methods and conclusions. &lt;br&gt;But this article discusses an episode that never even made it to air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On You Tube there is a viral video called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJ_9ji73MU"&gt;Ouija Board: Planchette moves on its own!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;This footage has enjoyed over 85,000 views. In this clip, two people are playing with a homemade Ouija board, when the planchette spells out the name “Lisa.” Suddenly, the planchette moves across the board, seemingly of its own accord, to rest on the letter “X.” The participants appear scared and jerk their hands off the planchette. They attempt the reading one last time, again the planchette moves by itself, and the frightened participants end the session promptly. They gently accuse each other of “pushing” the planchette, as does a third, unseen camera person in the background, but they all staunchly deny any trickery was involved. To demonstrate that there are no magnets or wires involved the camera person films below and above the Ouija board. Fact or faked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was actually created by skeptics. Produced by the &lt;a href="http://rockymountainparanormal.com/"&gt;Rocky Mountain Paranormal Research Society&lt;/a&gt; (RMPRS), the video was part of a promotional gimmick for a TV project called &lt;i&gt;Colorado X&lt;/i&gt;. This is the significance of the planchette moving back to the “X”. But the planchette wasn’t moved by spirits, demons or even the ideomotor effect. It was moved by string. &lt;br&gt;To achieve the movement, fishing wire was fed through a hole in the center of the “X” on the board, and attached to the front leg of the planchette. A fourth unseen participant was sitting to the right side of the board, holding the string. At the appropriate time, the string was tugged and the planchette darts across the board, landing on the “X” as though this were a message from beyond. &lt;br&gt;In the viewer comments section, one may read a range of theories to explain the phenomenon, with very few skeptical explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along came John Maas, producer of &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt;. Scouting for paranormal footage online, Maas and his staff discovered the video and thought it perfect “evidence” for an episode of the show. But the footage wasn’t fantastic enough. Without ever asking if the footage was fact or faked, Maas asked the group to re-film the scene to emphasize that no string or magnets were used, but… to also show the planchette moving more dramatically across the board. The producer of &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt; was asking the group to fake the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RMPRS immediately contacted both D.J. Grothe and I, and we advised they continue the interaction to monitor the producers. The group shared all future correspondence with the JREF. &lt;br&gt;In an email to RMPRS member Matt Baxter, Maas gave directions for the re-film. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Supervising Producer is looking for:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Ask them if they can lift up the planchette at end to show there is no magnet...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) Could the planchette move a little bit more dramatically?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maas was asking the group to show that there was no trickery involved, but also asking them to reshoot the video ostensibly to trick the team, and the audience, into believing that this is, or could be, real paranormal activity. He was asking them to fix the footage, and this would bias the results and the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group complied and reshot the scene, submitting it to Maas. However, it still wasn’t sensationalist enough. Maas replied: &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Great! I'll show the supervising producer - really good, though I'm sure she's going to ask to see the planchette move a bit more towards the end...hate to ask you again when you went back and got all that footage, but let me know if there is a shot of the planchette really zooming around...(don't even need all those dudes there again, just a really dramatic planchette zoom)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maas contacted his supervising producer and sure enough, she wanted a more dramatic movement of the planchette. The planchette darting across the board at the end of the scene is the paranormal money shot, and it was worth it to the producers to sweeten the deal with a bribe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hello! It's Jon Maas - so the Supervising Producer wants the clip, but a little bit different. If the footage is good enough for a case and it comes in 48 hours, we can pay a license fee of $1500...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don't need necessarily everyone like the first video - ie you don't need to round up the posse but...the story of the place is good enough.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The supervising producer has requested the clip be:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;* Less staged (more like the first video)&lt;br&gt;* A bit more freakout like the first video&lt;br&gt;* Planchette moves a bit more dramatically&lt;br&gt;* Once again show the "no magnets" thing&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;If it gets approved by the network, $1500 license fee. Let me know either way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1500 is a cruelly tempting offer to starving skeptical paranormal investigators, but this would have been a deal with the devil. It would have been interesting to follow through with the project and then expose the producers, but then the group would have to become involved in the episode. They would lose the rights to the video, and lose their rights to the way in which they were portrayed. A one-off fee would damage their reputation for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if groups without ethics, or with a desire for fifteen-minutes of fame, had been contacted instead? Perhaps this accounts for the other episodes of &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt;… &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt; is the paranormal equivalent of wrestling shows. Their “evidence” isn’t proof of the paranormal, but proof that some shows are fixed. The fact is that &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt; wanted to fake the video, to falsify the evidence and results. There is no proof that the producers intended to present the footage as factual, or as paranormal evidence, but they did warn that they would present the footage and portray the group in any way they liked. The producers never once asked if the footage was faked, but they did ask that the footage be altered; it is tacit that they knew the film was faked. &lt;br&gt;The requests to move the planchette more dramatically reveals the dishonesty of the producers, and the inauthenticity of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, &lt;i&gt;Fact or Faked&lt;/i&gt; would have been faked, in an inside job. &lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:8pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Both of these guys are serious thinkers, and despite Kitcher's facepalm-inspiring invocation of the "militant" canard, he seems to be saying some mostly downright reasonable things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even before I get a chance to read it in depth, I want to point something out:  The content of Kitcher's essay, though it purports to be a critique of the Gnu Atheism, is actually a huge win for our side.  We are seeing the Overton Window in action here folks.  As Dennett points out right in the first paragraph of his response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I went to some lengths in &lt;i&gt;Breaking the Spell&lt;/i&gt; to distinguish two spells one might consider breaking: the taboo against looking "too closely" at religion, holding it up to the same harsh light of rational probing to which we subject all other important phenomena,  and the spell of religion itself....Kitcher ignores my distinction but in fact is in &lt;b&gt;nearly perfect harmony with my positions&lt;/b&gt; on them. His essay is an &lt;i&gt;example&lt;/i&gt; of breaking the first spell: he writes with unflinching candor about the shaky status of any religion adopted on what he calls the &lt;i&gt;belief model&lt;/i&gt;, and uses that spell-broken perspective to look hard at the prospects for keeping...perhaps the only surviving mode of religion that can provide the benefits he wants to preserve...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;(italics in original, bold added)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is exactly right -- while Kitcher is kinder to the institution of religion than most Gnu Atheists (myself included), he does not pull any punches in regards to the implausibility of the truth claims of religion.  And as a result of the visibility of the Gnu Atheism over the past several years, he can write this and still seem downright &lt;i&gt;conciliatory&lt;/i&gt;.  Imagine if he had written this in, say, 2000 --  &lt;i&gt;Kitcher&lt;/i&gt; would have come off as the strident and shrill one!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Kitcher's use of the word "militant" and his digs at a somewhat strawmanny version of Gnu Atheism are unfortunate, overall it seems to be a very candid and mature discussion of the role of religion in society.  Just as with the &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2010/09/importance-of-being-dick.html"&gt;media reaction to Stephen Hawking's comments on God&lt;/a&gt;, it is the Gnu Atheists who have paved the way for that kind of public discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep it up, dicks!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-604229519727431672?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286464315590"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/neoacademic/~3/aTWv4YwFSvg/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40be898db2d3303b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Should Children with Autism Play Video Games?

	Cows are pretty harmless animals - they chew their cud, wait to get slaughtered or tipped and generally are inoffensive creatures. 

	Until you smell their farts.

	Cow farts are one of the most toxic things on the planet, the amount of methane they produce makes the oil industry look like angels.  So why is that people are flocking to their hybrid cars on the way to the steakhouse?  New research is suggesting that the global population has to reduce our meat consumption by up to 40% just to maintain the current state of the environment.  With countries like China increasing their demand for beef at alarming rates and North Americans unwilling to give up their 72 ounce steak-eating contests, our ability to decrease meat consumption seems all but impossible.

	That is, until Science in Seconds tells you that you have to.  Put down the hot dog (oh..nevermind, that&amp;#39;s not meat).

On one hand the clever lyrics make me laugh, but it’s also worth pointing out that the video isn’t really much of an exaggeration of the work environment for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In and out of academia, women (&lt;em&gt;and occasionally men&lt;/em&gt;) often receive unwanted attention just getting through the course of a day, which can be uncomfortable and challenging.

&lt;p&gt;It's actually a bit sad: he comes right out and says that he's an anti-theist, but that he's never told his parents (I guess the news is out now!). It also sounds like he's a bit estranged from his father, saying "I really dislike my father". He's still living with them, but is "quarantined" in the basement so he doesn't contaminate his brothers and sisters with his weird godless ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very interesting discussion, but I just have to say that seeing fathers and sons unreconciled, even if the father is a bit squirrely, is rather depressing to me. I simultaneously want to praise the younger Behe for being smart and articulate, and also urge him to make peace with his family while he can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/michael_behes_son_has_a_surpri.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/FTDxfQ5_mag" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286462429186"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/whither_the_weather_linux_cli.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c7e1bac6961a1ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linux"/><title type="html">Whither the weather?

The gas and dust collapse to form the stars themselves, but when they switch on the stars blow out vast and terrible winds, which sculpt and carve the surrounding material. And while this chaos must create violence locally, when you take a step back it can be quite beautiful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/publicationjpg/eso1039a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/vista_monocerosr2.jpg" alt="vista_monocerosr2" title="vista_monocerosr2" width="610" height="481"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to get the massively embiggened 10000 x 8000 pixel picture!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an infrared image &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1039"&gt;taken by the European Southern Observatory’s VISTA camera&lt;/a&gt;. It shows a region called R2 in the constellation of Monoceros (literally, &amp;quot;one horn&amp;quot; — it’s a unicorn!) where stars are being born at a furious rate. In the big version you can see shock waves from winds colliding with gas, streamers blown out as the winds escape the cloud, and other fantastic and surreal shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny. It’s rare that I’ll see an astronomy image of a nebula and have no clue what object it is, but this was one of those cases. I knew it was a star-forming region, and I would’ve guessed it was in the IR, but which particular nebula it is I wouldn’t have been able to figure out. The shape, the structure, all of it is unfamiliar! And that’s what happens when we probe the skies in new wavelengths with sensitive cameras. In this case, too, the image is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, covering an area of the sky more than a degree and a half across — that’s enough to cover the Moon 5 times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISTA is a 67 megapixel (yes, you read that right) camera designed to take surveys of the sky, big chunks of it at a time so that we can understand better what’s going on there on a larger scale. Most astronomical imagery covers an area of the sky you can block out with a thumbnail at arm’s length — and most Hubble images would be blocked by a grain of sand! We sometimes miss the big picture that way, and machines like VISTA help us fill in those very large blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’ll need to know. In a million years, maybe two, the stars in the core of R2 are going to start exploding. Don’t worry, at a distance of 2700 light years they’re way too far to hurt us. But that’ll completely tear apart the nebula over time, and astronomers in that long-distant future will want to have basic maps of the area when it happens. These are our first steps toward creating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Disturbing words from a very powerful archaeologist! What's going on!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though woefully ignorant of Indian archaeology, I have a reasonable grasp of Western European and US archaeology, and I believe I have a pretty good idea of what's going on in Scandinavia. And I have seen no sign of any worldwide crisis. Particularly not one that might be effectively mitigated by practitioners "rethinking their ideas and concepts of analysis". What has Dr. Sengupta discovered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt; quotes from a speech given yesterday by Sengupta at a graduation ceremony at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_College_%28Pune%29"&gt;Deccan College in Pune&lt;/a&gt;. But though we are told that there is a problem, we do not learn specifically what the problem is, only a little about what Sengupta believes should be done to solve it.&lt;blockquote&gt;"...archeology needs to reinvent itself. This is just the beginning and there is still a long way to go. This is the beginning to a more critical, interpretive, self-reflexive and holistic archaeology which wishes to understand the various dimensions of human behaviour in the past and the present."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical, interpretive, self-reflexive and holistic. This, Dear Reader, is a clutch of outdated buzzwords from UK theoretical archaeology. The words are badges that used to identify the theoretically hip in about 1997, when &lt;a href="http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/071/Ant0710691.htm"&gt;Ian Hodder used them to market a new kind of fieldwork methodology&lt;/a&gt; that turned out not to be so new after all.

&lt;p&gt;So, unless there was a lot more to Dr. Sengupta's speech, I would like to take this opportunity to reassure any worried recent archaeology graduates of the Deccan College. There is no worldwide crisis in archaeology. The discipline does not need to reinvent itself. This is not the beginning and there is not a longer way to go than there was before. You need not strive for a more critical, interpretive, self-reflexive or holistic archaeology, as this has been tried and did not lead anywhere. As for understanding the various dimensions of human behaviour in the past and the present, that is just business as usual. Surely most of the graduates listening to the director general's speech were completely aware of this.

&lt;p&gt;Well, the most recent episode of &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; (which, shut up, I know you watch it, too, and if you post in the comments that you don’t because you think it’s awful then we’ll all just assume you’re overcompensating because you love it so god damn much) is all about JESUS, but really it’s all about Kurt because honestly, if Kurt and Jesus are co-starring in anything you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; who’s going to steal the show. THIS GUY:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/kurt2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/kurt2.png" alt="" title="kurt from glee and the FSM" width="293" height="473"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope our genuflection to the great spaghetti monster in the sky doesn’t take too long.”&lt;br&gt;
- Kurt “The Adorablest Atheist Ever” Hummel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the gist of the episode: Kurt’s dad has a heart attack and lands in a coma, and all the Glee kids are thinking of religion because Finn the Moron has started worshipping a Grilled Cheesus. So they all keep talking (singing) about god, and Kurt’s all “Hey thanks, great song, but I don’t believe in god,” which he says pretty damned respectfully and calmly considering that his dad is in a coma and everyone is bugging him with their stupid god-talk and Whitney Houston songs. Here is where Kurt proves that he is just the best: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve all professed your beliefs, I’m just stating mine. I think God is kind of like Santa Claus for adults. Otherwise God’s kind of a jerk, isn’t he? I mean he makes me gay and then has his followers going around telling me it’s something that I chose, as if someone would choose to be mocked every single day of their life. And right now I don’t want a heavenly father. I want my real one back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But Kurt, how do you know for sure? You can’t prove that there is no god,” says Gosperella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t prove there isn’t a magical teapot floating around on the dark side of the moon with a dwarf inside of it that reads romance novels and shoots lightning out of its boobs but it seems pretty unlikely doesn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says the brilliant Brittany: “Is god an evil dwarf?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We shouldn’t be talking like this,” says the Abstinence-Only Single Mother. “It’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry Quinn, but you can all believe whatever you want to but I can’t believe something I don’t. I appreciate your thoughts, but I don’t want your prayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVE YOU KURT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not enough to shut them up, though, demonstrating that yes, the rest of the Glee club (besides the wonderful Brittany) are incredibly annoying. They even go to the hospital and sing spiritual songs to Kurt’s dad behind Kurt’s back. WTF? Who does this? Have you people even met this guy before? Stop touching his head in an overly familiar manner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Kurt learns that his friends are just trying to help him using their crazy magical chants and whatnot, which, okay, is a good lesson to learn. But nobody else really seems to learn the lesson that maybe you should STFU about your religion when it’s actively bothering your grieving friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXCEPT the school counselor, who gets a well-deserved bitch-out from none other than the episode’s other atheist: Sue Motherfucking Sylvester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Asking someone to believe in a fantasy, however comforting, isn’t a moral thing to do. It’s cruel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you think that’s just a little bit arrogant?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just as arrogant as telling someone how to believe in god and if they don’t accept it no matter how open-hearted or honest their dissent they’re going to hell. Well that doesn’t sound very Christian, does it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that’s what you believe, that’s fine, but please keep it to yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So long as you do the same. That kid could lose his father at any moment. You should start preparing him for that. Now get the hell out of my office. I realize you’re only half orangutan but I’m still very allergic to your lustrous ginger mane.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVE YOU SUE SYLVESTER!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sue-sylvester-picture.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sue-sylvester-picture.png" alt="" title="Sue Sylvester HEART" width="453" height="654"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As awesome as the two atheist characters are, though, the portrayal of athe&lt;em&gt;ism&lt;/em&gt; could have been better. Both of them give reasons for their atheism, and both reasons are because life was unfair to them and they couldn’t see how a loving god would allow that. That’s a perfectly valid reason for not believing in an omni-benevolent god, but it obscures the main reason why I suspect most people have no religion: because there is no evidence. This is at least briefly covered in Kurt’s referencing of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&amp;#39;s_teapot"&gt;Russel’s teapot&lt;/a&gt;, but Sue’s back story leaves us remembering both of them as tortured souls who maybe just haven’t found Jesus yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final criticism: Kurt’s big song was a pretty super, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OxLmnZVSH4"&gt;slow, emotional version of &lt;em&gt;I Want To Hold Your Hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Okay. But couldn’t he have had some big atheist number since everyone else got all Jesusy (or Yenta-y as the case may be)? A cover of Sarah McLauchlan’s cover of XTC’s &lt;em&gt;Dear God&lt;/em&gt;, maybe? Or Nick Cave’s &lt;em&gt;Into My Arms&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was nice to see some awesome characters on a really popular show come out as proud atheists who don’t get converted at the end. But yeah, we could still do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/billboard-button.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://census-campaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/billboard-button.png" title="CensusCampaign" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The 2001 census introduced a new question on religion. It was a single, closed, leading question –- “What is your religion?” –- which produced a very high measure of religiosity compared to all other surveys. Millions of people were counted as religious when their “religion” was only a nominal, cultural affiliation, or just a habitual response to ticking “Christian”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple, yet important, campaign.  The BHA is making a simple request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re not religious we recommend ticking ‘No religion’ for the Census 2011 question on religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticking ‘No religion’ is better than &lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk/whats-wrong-with-the-census/why-should-i-answer-the-question-at-all/"&gt;leaving the question unanswered&lt;/a&gt; because this way you count. And it’s better than &lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk/what-is-happening/ticking-christian/"&gt;answering with the religion you were brought up in&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t believe in it anymore and don’t think organised religion speaks for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/census-question-extract.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://census-campaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/census-question-extract.jpg" title="CensusQuestion" width="550" height="282"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that easy.  Why on earth would anyone not participate…?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m sure there are a few reasons, but they’re all stretches. Just check the box.  And let them know you exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important?  The BHA &lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk/what-is-happening/why-should-i-answer-the-question-at-all/"&gt;offers a few reasons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important that the Census generates accurate figures. It is used to legitimise resource allocation and policy. The more people tick the ‘No Religion’ box, the less inaccurate ‘evidence’ there is that government should listen to religious groups and leaders over and above other groups within society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no negative repercussions on you personally if you do. The Census is not interested in you personally- it is used to find general themes in the population. Although it is not anonymous, personal data will not be traced back to you in any analysis so there should be very limited issues about privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be affected by negative use of the data. Social policy, services and government action affects everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be the last Census ever held- if we get inaccurate data we may be stuck with it forever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increased percentage of non-religious people will mean an increased voice for your issues as a non-religious person in society, particularly in equality work and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty more information on &lt;a href="http://census-campaign.org.uk"&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt;.  While you’re reading that — or if you don’t live in Britain — you can also &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/census"&gt;donate to the campaign&lt;/a&gt; so that they can advertise the hell out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop making excuses and check the box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m not aware of many people who&amp;#39;ve changed their minds on this issue, perhaps because doing so would require a study of the last 2,500 years of history, religion and politics.Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be handy if science could provide an answer? According to the authors of a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the &amp;quot;cycle&amp;quot; school is right: both sides are fighting back against the other: Both sides retaliate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The authors (from Switzerland, Israel and the USA) took data on daily fatalities on both sides, and also of daily launches of Palestinian &amp;quot;Qassam&amp;quot; rockets at Israel. The data run from 2001, the start of the current round of unpleasantness, to late 2008, the Gaza War.They looked to see whether the number of events that happened on a certain day predicted the number of events caused by the other side on the following days, i.e. whether a Palestinian death caused the Palestinians to retaliate by firing more rockets and killing more Israelis, and vice versa.What happened? They found that both sides were more likely to launch attacks on the days following a death on their own side. The exception to this rule was that Israel did not noticeably retaliate against Qassam launches. This is perhaps because Qassams are so ineffective: out of 3,645 recorded launches, they killed 15 people.These graphs show the number of &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; actions on the days following a event, averaged over the whole 8 years, according to a statistical method called the Impulse Response Function. Note that the absolute size of the effects is larger for the Israeli retaliations (the Y axis is bigger); there were a total of 4,874 Palestinian fatalities and 1,062 Israeli fatalitiesThe authors then used another method called Vector Autoregression to discover more about the relationship. In theory, this method controls for the past history of actions by a given side, so that it reveals the number of actions independently caused by the opposing side.the number of Qassams fired increases by 6% on the first day after a single killing of a Palestinian by Israel; the probability of any Qassams being fired increases by 11%; and the probability of any Israelis being killed by Palestinians increases by 10%. Conversely, 1 day after the killing of a single Israeli by Palestinians, the number of Palestinians killed by Israel increases by 9%, and the probability of any Palestinians being killed increases by 20%....retaliation accounts for a larger fraction of Palestinian compared with Israeli aggression: in the levels specification, 10% of all Qassam rockets can be attributed to prior Israeli attacks on Palestinians, but only 4% of killings of Palestinians by Israel can be attributed to prior Palestinian attacks on Israel.... 6% of all days on which Palestinians attack Israel with rockets, and 5% of all days on which they attack by killing Israelis, can be attributed to retaliation; in contrast, this is true for only 2% of all days on which Israel kills Palestinians.What are we to make of this? This is a good paper as far as it goes, and it casts doubt on earlier analyses finding that Israel is retaliating against Palestinians but not vice versa. However, the inherent problem with all of this research (beyond the fact that it&amp;#39;s all based on correlations and can only indirectly imply causation), is that it focuses on individual acts of violence. The authors say, citing surveys, thatOver one half of Israelis and three quarters of Palestinians think the other side seeks to take over their land. When accounting for their own acts of aggression, Israelis often claim to be merely responding to Palestinian violence, and Palestinians often see themselves as simply reacting to Israeli violence.But I don&amp;#39;t think many Israelis would argue that the IDF only kills individual Palestinians as a reflex reaction to a particular attack. They&amp;#39;re claiming that the whole conflict is a defensive one, that the Palestinians are the aggressors, but that doesn&amp;#39;t rule out their taking the initiative on a tactical level e.g. in destroying Palestinian military capabilities before they have a chance to attack. And vice versa on the other side.WW2 was a war of aggression by the Axis powers, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the Allies only killed Axis soldiers after they&amp;#39;d attacked a certain place. The Allies were on the offensive for the second half of the war, and eventually invaded the Axis&amp;#39;s own homelands, but it was still a defensive war, because the Axis were responsible for it.For Israel and for Palestine, the other guys are to blame for the whole thing. Who&amp;#39;s right, if anyone, is fundamentally a historical, political and ethical question, that can&amp;#39;t be answered by looking at day-to-day variations in who&amp;#39;s shooting when.Comment Policy: Please only comment if you&amp;#39;ve got something to say about this paper, or related research.

Because I was in full grant writing frenzy to get an R01 in the can by Friday, pretty much anything that wasn't totally urgent got shoved aside, at least after Wednesday. Of course, it was last Wednesday that yet another mammography study was being touted as a "landmark" study. I had just enough time to look it over briefly and decide that I really should blog about it, particularly given that it came hot on the heels of a Norwegian study less than a week before that found the benefits of mammography to be less than previously believed and even more particularly because this study apparently showed that mammography was much more beneficial to women between the ages of 40-49 than previously thought. Given the kerfuffle over the USPSTF update of its guidelines for mammography last fall, where the USPSTF recommended starting regular mammography at the age of 50 rather than 40 and ran into a buzzsaw of criticism, both honest, dishonest, and from those who were protecting their turf. Naturally, with that background, the question is: Does this study help to clarify the question of assessing the benefits versus the risks of screening mammography? Or does it complicate things even more?

Perhaps a little of both.

As I've written about over the last couple of years, evidence has been accumulating that is muddying the picture regarding the benefits of screening mammography, So, before I move on to the study, let's be absolutely clear on what it is that we are discussing here. Screening mammography is different from diagnostic mammography in that it is performed at regular intervals in asymptomatic women in order to detect cancer at an earlier stage and thereby allow earlier intervention, resulting in the saving of more lives than if we waited until breast cancer produces symptoms (such as a lump) that lead to diagnosis. If a woman feels a lump or some change in her breast and undergoes mammography, that is not screening. In that case, mammography is being done for diagnostic purposes. We are not discussing diagnostic mammography. We are discussing screening mammography. I can't emphasize that distinction enough.

The study that was reported last week was performed in Sweden and reported under such headlines as New mammogram study stirs debate for women in 40s; Mammogram Benefit Seen for Women in Their 40s; and Swedish mammography study sows more confusion about screening for breast cancer. I found radiologists I know circulating the study as though it were vindication, and Dr. Len of the American Cancer Society touted it as being very important, while Dr. Daniel B. Kopans (whom we've met before crudely and blatantly defending his turf over the USPSTF guidelines) declared that the study "should end any debate and end the use of age 50 as a threshold for screening."

I wish it were easier to find good candidates. I was sent the campaign page for this Republican bozo in New Mexico, and one of the important issues he addresses is the &lt;a href="http://www.peopleforpearce.com/content/national-day-prayer-and-rights-majority"&gt;atheist effort to outlaw prayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians are just sick and  tired of turning the other cheek while our courts strip us of  all our rights.  Our parents and grandparents taught us  to pray before eating, to pray before we go to  sleep. Our  Bible tells us to pray without ceasing.  Now a handful of  people and their lawyers are telling us to cease  praying.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
God, help us.  And if  that last sentence offends you, well, just sue  me.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The  silent majority has been silent too long.  It's time we  tell that one or two who scream loud enough to be heard that  the vast majority doesn't care what they want.  It is  time that the majority rules!   It's time we tell them, "You don't have to pray; you  don't have to say the Pledge of Allegiance; you don't have to  believe in God or attend services that honour Him.  That  is your right, and we will honour your right; but by golly, you are no longer going to take our rights away.  We are fighting back, and we WILL WIN!"
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
God bless us one and all...Especially those who denounce Him, God  bless America and Canada, despite all our faults  We are still the  greatest nations of all. God  bless our service men who are fighting to protect our right to pray and worship God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost hate to break the news to him. There are no godless laws criminalizing prayer. There aren't even any atheists &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;hoping&lt;/i&gt; to make prayer illegal. Go ahead — you want to pray before a football game, no one is stopping you. You want to pray before eating and sleeping, and you want to teach your kids to do that, too, then you may. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we plan to take away is your privilege of being able to seize a bullhorn as a public official, and in your official capacity order everyone else to pray.  If Pearce were actually sincere in his claim that he wants to tell us that we don't have to pray, then there is no issue here. But of course, he's not sincere. He wants to win a secular public office so he can bray that this is a Christian nation, and put his superstitions about God into our government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that makes him a lying sack of soggy sewage &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; an idiot, which ought to disqualify him for office if it weren't for the fact that too often those seem to be prerequisites for getting elected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/new_mexico_dont_vote_for_steve.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ZRqn75UrDLc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286454623110"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=5140">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/edebfd7bc223709a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><category term="Climate modelling"/><category term="Sun-earth connections"/><title type="html">Solar spectral stumper</title><published>2010-10-07T12:12:55Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T12:12:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/10/solar-spectral-stumper/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s again time for one of those puzzling results that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they turn out to be true, would have some very important implications and upset a lot of relatively established science. The big issue of course is the “if”. The case in question relates to some results published this week in Nature by &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7316/full/nature09426.html"&gt;Joanna Haigh and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;. They took some ‘hot off the presses’ satellite data from the &lt;a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/index.htm"&gt;SORCE mission&lt;/a&gt; (which has been in operation since 2003) and ran it through a relatively complex chemistry/radiation model. These data are &lt;a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/sorce/sorce_ssi/ts.html"&gt;measurements&lt;/a&gt; of how the solar output varies as a function of wavelength from an instrument called “SIM” (the Spectral Irradiance Monitor).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been known for some time that over a solar cycle, different wavelengths vary with different amplitudes. For instance, Lean (2000) showed that the UV component varied by about 10 times as much as the total solar irradiance (TSI) did over a cycle. This information (and subsequent analyses) have lent a lot of support to the idea that solar variability changes have an important amplification via changes in stratospheric ozone (&lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=sh05100g"&gt;Shindell et al (2001)&lt;/a&gt;, for instance). So it is not a novel finding that the SIM results in the UV don’t look exactly like the TSI. What is a surprise is that for the visible wavelengths, SIM seems to suggest that the irradiance changes are opposite in sign to the changes in the TSI. To be clear, while the TSI has decreased since 2003 (as part of the descent into the current solar minimum), SIM seems to indicate that the UV decreases are much larger than expected, while irradiance in visible bands has actually &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;! This is counter to any current understanding of what controls irradiance on solar cycle timescales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of such a phenomena? Well, since the UV portion of the solar input is mostly absorbed in stratosphere, it is the visible and near-IR portions of the irradiance change that directly influence the lower atmosphere. Bigger changes in the UV also imply bigger changes in stratospheric ozone and temperature, and this influences the tropospheric radiative forcing too. Indeed, according to Haigh’s calculations, the combination of the two effects means that the net radiative forcing at the tropopause is opposite in sign to the TSI change. So during a solar minimum you would expect a &lt;em&gt;warmer&lt;/em&gt; surface!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the longer term variance in solar output has been hypothesised to follow what happens over the solar cycle and so if verified, this result would imply that all current attributions to solar variability of temperature changes in the lower atmosphere and surface ocean would be of the wrong sign. Mechanisms elucidated in multiple models from &lt;a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/publications/meehl_solar.pdf"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2007/2007GL030207.shtml"&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt; would no longer have any validity. It would be shocking stuff indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, there might be another missing element (such as a cosmic-ray/cloud connection) that would counteract this physics and restore the expected sign of the change, but no-one has succeeded in finding any mechanism that would quantitatively give anything close the size of effect that would now be required (see &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/aerosol-effects-and-climate-part-ii-the-role-of-nucleation-and-cosmic-rays/"&gt;our previous posts&lt;/a&gt; on the subject). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this result likely to be true? In my opinion, no. The reason why has nothing to do with problems related to the consequences, but rather from considerations of what the SIM data are actually showing. This figure gives a flavour of the issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/Lean_spectra_timeseries.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(courtesy Judith Lean). Estimates of irradiance in three bands are given in each panel, along with the raw measurements from various satellite instruments over the last 30 years. The SIM data are the purple dots in the third panel.  While it does seem clear that the overall trend from 2003 to 2009 is an increase, closer inspection suggests that this anti-phase behaviour only lasts for the first few years, and that subsequently the trends are much closer to expectation. It is conceivable, for instance, that there was some undetected or unexpected instrument drift in the first few years. The proof of the pudding will come in the next couple of years. If the SIM data show a decrease while the TSI increases towards the solar maximum, then the Haigh et al results will be more plausible. If instead, the SIM data increase, that would imply there is an unidentified problem with the instrument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this is one of those pesky uncertainties we scientists love so much…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286454042666"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/does_everything_have_to_be_lac.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/193be09742abc0b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating science"/><title type="html">Does everything have to be laced with religion?</title><published>2010-10-07T12:16:30Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T12:16:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/4ECT-fjLS9U/does_everything_have_to_be_lac.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/does_everything_have_to_be_lac.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian has opened a new permanent &lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/"&gt;Hall of Human Origins&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, which means I need to get out to Washington DC sometime. Unfortunately, it gets a &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;mixed review from Greg Mayer&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds like the museum faced the standard dilemma of whether to emphasize information or interaction, and parts of the exhibit steered a little too far in the direction of interactive fluffiness. It also has some underlying weirdness: the hall was funded by a Tea Party bigwig, David Koch, and it also had &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/new-human-evolution-hall-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;a "Broader Social Impacts Committee"&lt;/a&gt; of mostly religious advisors, which is just plain odd — what was their purpose? Was the USNM trying to intentionally filter the information, somehow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/evolution-exhibits-and-religion/"&gt;Jerry Coyne looks a little deeper at that part of the exhibit&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a lesser subtone of pandering to religion, and while it doesn't overwhelm the story at all, there's still an element of turning an exhibit on the science of evolution into an opportunity to promote theology. Which may partly explain why a wealthy kook like Koch was willing to throw money at it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/does_everything_have_to_be_lac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/4ECT-fjLS9U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286453722111"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=19932">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89af113ff0553583</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Accommodationism"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="philosophy"/><title type="html">Kitcher versus Dennett: Is New Atheism counterproductive?</title><published>2010-10-07T12:15:13Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T12:15:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/kitcher-versus-dennett-is-new-atheism-counterproductive-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, but if you’re interested in strategies for combatting religion, you might find it valuable—not for my lucubrations, but for a thoughtful discussion between two prominent atheists and philosophers, Philip Kitcher and Daniel Dennett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of Philip Kitcher, a professor of philosophy at  Columbia who’s also something of a polymath (he teaches courses on Joyce  and has written &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joyces-Kaleidoscope-Invitation-Finnegans-Wake/dp/0195321022"&gt;an introduction to &lt;em&gt;Finnegan’s Wake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  He’s also written groundbreaking critiques of creationism (&lt;em&gt;Abusing Science&lt;/em&gt;) and of evolutionary psychology (&lt;em&gt;Vaulting Ambition&lt;/em&gt;).  Philip and Ned Block were valuable allies in the attacks on Jerry  Fodor’s and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini’s anti-natural-selection  nonsense.  And  I enjoyed (and blurbed) Kitcher’s most recent philosophy  book,&lt;em&gt; Living with Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, a trenchant critique of intelligent  design. In that book’s last chapter, Kitcher warns against too-strident  critiques of religion, arguing that faith provides a lot of social  benefits to people, and that replacing faith means finding a humanism  that dispenses those benefits.  That seemed reasonable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in  &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2010.00500.x/full"&gt;“Militant modern atheism”&lt;/a&gt; Kitcher’s new piece in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, he’s taken his criticism of atheism a bit further (access is free, and you can download a pdf).  His main point is that New Atheists, while attacking the truth claims of religion and demanding that the faithful adduce evidence, are completely ignoring what may be the most important aspects of faith: its function as a form of social glue and as a community that meets a human need for participation and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher distinguishes what he calls the “belief model”—the form of faith that is &lt;em&gt;initially&lt;/em&gt; built on truth claims about God, Jesus, Mohamed and the like—from three other forms of what he calls the “orientation” model: the forms of faith that begin with a person identifying secular goals and beliefs that he shares with others, and then choosing a faith that properly frames these goals. Kitcher calls the three religious forms of the orientation model the &lt;em&gt;mythically self conscious&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;doctrinally-entangled&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;doctrinally-indefinite&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll leave you to read about their differences in his article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher contends that New Atheists, by concentrating solely on the “belief model,” don’t realize that adherents to the other three models don’t care that much about specific truth claims of faith.  Therefore, the Gnus are attacking faith at a place where it’s not that vulnerable.  As he says, “Nobody who reflects on what sociologists have to say about the ways in which people become attracted to particular religions will suppose that the spread of a creed has much to do with its truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher concludes that for most people the benefits of faith outweigh any problems of believing in falsehoods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . it is a fallacy to think that, for any religious person who currently fits the orientation model, that person can attain a cognitively superior position by rejecting the beliefs militant modern atheists discern as false.  The cognitive gains can simply be outweighed by other forms of psychological and social loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems to think that its social benefits portend that religion will be with us forever, or at least until atheists find a way to associate those same benefits with humanism.  And he takes prominent Gnus like Dennett and Dawkins to task for suggesting that the contemplation of science and the universe can provide psychic benefits that can replace religion.  After quoting Dawkins on the wonders of science, Kitcher notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much to agree with in these passages, but they seduce readers—and Dawkins and Dennett too, I suspect, into thinking that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can orient a worthwhile life, one that will survive reflective probing, on the basis of contemplation of the cosmos as the sciences have revealed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch!  Well, I’m not sure whether Richard and Dan would agree that they’ve prescribed a diet of science to replace a gluttony on Jesus, but never mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own comments on Kitcher’s piece (Dennett’s much longer take is posted below) are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitcher concentrates on the “orientation model” because that’s the one he finds most “interesting.” But I’m not sure that it’s the most &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt;.  Surely the orientation model is the one held by liberal believers, but is it adhered to by &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; believers throughout the world?  Kitcher doesn’t discuss this.  Do remember that a large majority of Americans profess belief in a personal God, in Satan, and in heaven.  Now that doesn’t mean that they’d stop believing if these ideas were falsified, but it does give one pause.  And do other religions like Hinduism and Islam adhere to the orientation model?  It seems as though Kitcher, while decrying the New Atheists for a form of intellectual arrogance, is also suggesting a model of faith that’s also quite intellectual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitcher seems to think that replacing religion with a socially-entangled humanism will be a very tough task, like teaching a cat to walk on a leash. He notes that “Within the actual social environments in which contemporary people grow up, doctrinal entanglement can be expected to persist, not because the arguments directed against the doctrines are incomplete or because the people who hang on to belief in transcendent entities are too stubborn or too stupid, but because enlightened secularism has not yet succeeded in finding surrogates for institutions and ideas that religious traditions have honed over centuries or millennia.”  Yet this is exactly what has happened in much of Europe, where religion is largely ceremonial and other institutions serve the social functions that religion used to have.  (I believe Kitcher mentions this in &lt;em&gt;Living with Darwin&lt;/em&gt;.)  And this happened over only a few centuries. Moreover, it happened not through atheists suggesting humanistic replacements for faith, but through the erosion of faith after the Enlightenment and perhaps a greater reliance of Europeans on family and community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think that Dennett, Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens have largely ignored the social benefits of religion. I can’t recall specific passages, but I know that Sam dealt explicitly in&lt;em&gt; The End of Faith &lt;/em&gt;with Zen Buddhism as a replacement for more conventional religions, and that the other three do discuss the real social benefits of faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their disagreements, Kitcher, Dennett, and Dawkins agree on much.  They all agree, for instance, that the “belief model” of religion is not only untenable but absolutely vulnerable to scientific attacks on religious truth claims.  And they agree that indoctrinating children with religious dogma is a terrible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennett, whose ideas are a major issue in Kitcher’s piece, has written a response to it.  Although this will ultimately appear elsewhere online, Dan has kindly given me permission to  post it here. It’s longer than our usual posts but well worth reading.  (Quotes in italics below are from Kitcher’s article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to some lengths in &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Spell &lt;/em&gt;to distinguish &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; spells one might consider breaking: the taboo against looking “too  closely” at religion, holding it up to the same harsh light of rational  probing to which we subject all other important phenomena,  and the  spell of religion itself.  In my book I declared my intent to break the  first spell and my agnosticism about the wisdom of breaking the  second—citing the very considerations that Kitcher advances more  positively.  Kitcher ignores my distinction but in fact is in nearly  perfect harmony with my positions on them. His essay is an &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; of breaking the first spell: he writes with unflinching candor about  the shaky status of any religion adopted on what he calls the &lt;em&gt;belief model&lt;/em&gt;,  and uses that spell-broken perspective to look hard at the prospects  for keeping the second spell unbroken, by relying on what he calls the &lt;em&gt;orientation model, &lt;/em&gt;supposing  that this is perhaps the only surviving mode of religion that can  provide the benefits he wants to preserve, which may just be a necessity  of meaningful life for many people.   As I noted in my book, there is a  reasonable fear that breaking the first spell will inevitably break the  second as well, which fear is the (obligatorily) tacit standard  justification for not breaking the first.  Kitcher vividly illustrates  that problem in his essay, trying to walk the tightrope without falling  into patronizing on one side or uneasy complicity with unacceptable  nonsense on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Kitcher’s introduction of the orientation model is to  give him a way of reversing—most of the time—the otherwise standard  dependence of serious commitments and aspirations on grounded beliefs.   The orientation-type religionists put commitments first, as the  fundamental landmarks of their lives, and let the expression of (what  take the place of) grounds for these commitments wander somewhat  opportunistically between  “mythically self-conscious”  metaphor at one  pole and “doctrinal “entanglement” (flirting with the belief model) at  the other, with convenient vagueness in the middle. (The “doctrinally  indefinite” folks “take refuge in language that is resonant and opaque,  metaphorical and poetic, and deny that they can do any better at  explaining the beliefs they profess.”) Whatever floats your boat, as one  says. And indeed, if maintaining a religious orientation is the only  way for you to have a meaningful life, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; rely on  whatever floats your boat. But then it will just make matters harder for  you if you have to confront Kitcher’s trio. Tell me, sir, have you  decided to go with mythic self-consciousness, doctrinal entanglement, or  doctrinal indefiniteness?  Don’t ask! Don’t tell!  That’s why many  think the first spell should not be broken, but Kitcher and I have both  ignored that admonition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher is at pains to express his defense of these delicate options sympathetically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll suggest that doctrinal indefiniteness can be a  reasonable expression of epistemic modesty, and that even doctrinal  entanglement can be justified when it is the only way of preserving, in  the socio-cultural environment available, a reflectively stable  orientation.  (p6) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;but a somewhat less diplomatic version hovers in the  background: kid yourself if you have to. And, I am happy to say, Kitcher  firmly draws the line at letting &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;of these options abrogate a commitment to reason when deciding ethical matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone who makes decisions affecting the lives of others is  ethically required to rely on those propositions best supported by the  evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a felicitous phrase he notes that “there ought to be no ‘teleological suspension of the ethical’,” but then just what is the &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; role of Abraham as a “knight of faith” supposed to be, when he so  clearly violates this principle?  Kitcher says that Abraham’s “sort of  trust is not legitimate”—you can’t put it much plainer than that—but  how, then, does Kitcher find a way of endorsing Abraham’s (mythical)  story as any sort of talisman for a meaningful life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher sketches a speculative account of the evolution of religious  phenomena that is, as he says, an alternative to my own speculative  conjecture—it sees the predominance of religion as explained by its  being (socially) adaptive, not a byproduct of other evolutionary  selection pressures—but he then draws a misleading contrast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; If you start with the thought that the predominance of religion  in human societies is to be explained by a cognitive deficiency, you  will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;tend [my italics] to see your campaign for the eradication  of myths in terms of a return to intellectual health. . . . By contrast,  if you suppose that the social factors towards which I have gestured  have played a non-trivial role in the spread of the world’s religions,  you will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;wonder&lt;/em&gt; [my italics] if there are psychological and social needs that the simple abandonment of religion will leave unfulfilled. (p9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be such a tendency, pulling in opposite directions, but Darwin long ago showed us that it should be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked  out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from  superfluous or injurious substances should be utilized for [other]  highly useful purposes. (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Various Contrivances by which Orchids. . . . 1862, p266—quoted in DDI, p461)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Kitcher’s wonder is just as available to me, and, similarly,  however socially adaptive religious phenomena may have been in the past,  their utility may have expired.  It is simply a mistake—but a very  common one—to seek a theory of the evolution of religious phenomena that  would provide some imagined warrant for your view of the value of  religion today.  I worked hard to keep these issues distinct in my book,  and Kitcher should acknowledge that his preferred speculation is  logically independent of the main point for which he is arguing: that  religion is valuable &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be. I find his most compelling point to be his  observation that Dawkins and I should not extrapolate glibly from our  own immense good fortune to find ourselves in a position not only to  understand and appreciate the glories of the scientific world view but  to have the thrill—no other word will suffice—of playing significant  roles in the spreading of this vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . . the vast majority will never be able to recognize themselves  as important participants in any impressive joint enterprise that  contributes to knowledge and enlightenment. (p11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss this in &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Spell &lt;/em&gt;(pp286-92), where I note that religion has the unparalleled capacity to give people a chance to be, in Kitcher’s good phrase, &lt;em&gt;important participants&lt;/em&gt; in the world they were born into. But as I go on to discuss there,  nobody has yet estimated what price we should be prepared to pay—in  xenophobia, violence, the glorification of unreason, the spreading of  patent falsehood—for that wonderful sense of importance religion gives  to many people who would otherwise lead lives without drama, without a  point.  Kitcher wants to preserve religions (at least for the  foreseeable future, I gather) but I think it would be better to work  constructively on secular institutions that can provide alternative  structures of meaning for everyone.  Still, we might accomplish this  most practically by encouraging existing religious institutions to  evolve into . . . . &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; religions.  Some have already done so,  but they are not yet competing very well in the marketplace of  allegiances. Who knows what the near future will bring?  Religions have  changed more in the last century than in the last millennium, and  perhaps they will change more in the next decade than in that last  century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher and I agree on so much.  We agree that “Public reason must  the thoroughly secular” (p12)  We agree that the belief model of  religion is indefensible. We agree that the first spell must be  broken—we have both broken it.  We differ, apparently, only in our  assessment of how to ease the people of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century into  a more reasonable and socially benign form of orientation.  But even  here, I think, we should both admit that we haven’t figured that out  yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because I was in full grant writing frenzy to get an R01 in the can by Friday, pretty much anything that wasn't totally urgent got shoved aside, at least after Wednesday. Of course, it was last Wednesday that yet another mammography study was being touted as a "landmark" study. I had just enough time to look it over briefly and decide that I really should blog about it, particularly given that it came hot on the heels of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/09/the_mammography_wars_heat_up_again.php"&gt;Norwegian study&lt;/a&gt; less than a week before that found the benefits of mammography to be less than previously believed and even more particularly because this study apparently showed that mammography was much more beneficial to women between the ages of 40-49 than previously thought. Given the kerfuffle over the USPSTF update of its guidelines for mammography last fall, where the USPSTF &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php"&gt;recommended starting regular mammography&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 50 rather than 40 and ran into a buzzsaw of criticism, both honest, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_fixin_death_panels_uspstf_mammography.php"&gt;dishonest&lt;/a&gt;, and from those who were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/12/how_not_to_protect_your_medical_turf.php"&gt;protecting their turf&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, with that background, the question is: Does this study help to clarify the question of assessing the benefits versus the risks of screening mammography? Or does it complicate things even more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a little of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've written about over the last couple of years, evidence has been accumulating that is muddying the picture regarding the benefits of screening mammography, So, before I move on to the study, let's be absolutely clear on what it is that we are discussing here. Screening mammography is different from diagnostic mammography in that it is performed at regular intervals in &lt;em&gt;asymptomatic&lt;/em&gt; women in order to detect cancer at an earlier stage and thereby allow earlier intervention, resulting in the saving of more lives than if we waited until breast cancer produces symptoms (such as a lump) that lead to diagnosis. If a woman feels a lump or some change in her breast and undergoes mammography, that is not screening. In that case, mammography is being done for diagnostic purposes. We are not discussing diagnostic mammography. We are discussing screening mammography. I can't emphasize that distinction enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study that was reported last week was performed in Sweden and reported under such headlines as &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100929/ap_on_he_me/us_med_mammograms"&gt;New mammogram study stirs debate for women in 40s&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html"&gt;Mammogram Benefit Seen for Women in Their 40s&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/29/news/la-heb-mammography-20100929"&gt;Swedish mammography study sows more confusion about screening for breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. I found radiologists I know circulating the study as though it were vindication, and Dr. Len of the American Cancer Society &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/DrLensBlog/post/2010/09/29/Its-Deja-Vu-Again-New-Study-Supports-Screening-Mammography-For-Women-Ages-40-49.aspx"&gt;touted it as being very important&lt;/a&gt;, while Dr. Daniel B. Kopans (whom we've met before crudely and blatantly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/12/how_not_to_protect_your_medical_turf.php"&gt;defending his turf over the USPSTF guidelines&lt;/a&gt;) declared that the study "should end any debate and end the use of age 50 as a threshold for screening."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so fast there, pardner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/better_late_than_never_the_swedish_mammo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/better_late_than_never_the_swedish_mammo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/iwF_0svkLqA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286453504851"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/robot_sucks_as_archery_then_ge.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4865219a95b1b73</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Robots"/><title type="html">Robot Sucks at Archery ... then gets better</title><published>2010-10-07T13:03:37Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T13:03:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/aD_TVAZOgcY/robot_sucks_as_archery_then_ge.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/robot_sucks_as_archery_then_ge.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QCXvAqIDpIw%26hl%3Den_US%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26version%3D3&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=390" width="640" height="390"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mario Vargas Llosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, we learn that his name is prounouced: "[ˈmaɾjo ˈβarɣaz ˈʎosa]"  Thank you very much Wikipedia, that was so xweʎul.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Vargas Llosa wrote La ciudad y los perros, La casa verde, 1965/1968), and the Conversación en la catedral.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Vargas_Llosa"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/and_the_nobel_prize_for_litera.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/bRCxL3ULOHA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286451571668"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/it_might_be_too_early_in_the_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d517ec4ac1d1b8b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">It might be too early in the morning for this:</title><published>2010-10-07T12:25:36Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T12:25:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/tXtL3q19rhU/it_might_be_too_early_in_the_m.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/it_might_be_too_early_in_the_m.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always thought this was a parody of something, but it turns out it's the real thing.&lt;br&gt;

When we heard about this, we asked for a copy of the program and obtained a transcript of precisely what she had said. After taking advice from counsel we asked our solicitors to write to her seeking an apology and an undertaking not to repeat such an allegation. In their response, solicitors for Mrs Bercow said that she "did not intend to (and did not) allege that Migrationwatch is a fascist or racist organisation", that she was expressing an honest opinion about the handling of a Migrationwatch report by the Daily Express and that she had a right to do so in a democratic society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Migrationwatch are strongly in favour of free speech. We accept her assurances about her intentions, and consider that important and sensitive issues such as immigration should be debated without descending into derogatory language and associations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In view of the assurance contained in her solicitor’s letter, we do not intend to take the matter further. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-7482010381680126080?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286451027071"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=19965">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3e084dbad883d29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="books"/><title type="html">Mario Vargas Llosa nabs Nobel, nobody nabs my book</title><published>2010-10-07T11:30:20Z</published><updated>2010-10-07T11:30:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/mario-vargas-llosa-nabs-nobel-nobody-nabs-my-book/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The readers have again drawn a blank in &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/contest-guess-the-nobel-laureates/"&gt;our guess-the-Nobel&lt;/a&gt; contest, as Peruvian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Vargas_Llosa"&gt;Mario Vargas Llosa&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1936), whom nobody named, just nabbed the Literature prize.  Curiously, a friend in Boston just recommended him to me as the best modern writer from Latin America.  I confess that I haven’t read him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was kind of hoping that Salman Rushdie would take it, for he surely deserves it—and it would really tick off his religious opponents.  My American wild-card favorite was Cormac McCarthy, but I don’t think he’ll see the Prize in his lifetime. (He also deserves it.)&lt;/p&gt;

He points out that in English, "Drums go 'rat-a-tat' and 'bang,' bells go 'ding dong,' and sad trombones go 'wah wah'", but he notes that there are some gaps that he finds surprising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Few instruments are as popular in the US as the guitar, but I have no idea what sound a guitar makes. There are gaps even for the standard high school band/orchestra instruments. What sound does a violin make? A flute? For that matter, what sound does an orchestra make? A rock group?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Is there a compelling explanation as to why we have words for the sounds of bells, trombones, and tubas, but not guitars? Why do we lack words for the sounds of groups of instruments? Do, say, Italians have a word for the sound a violin makes? Do the French have a word for the sound of a French Horn?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the situation in English instrumental onomatopeia is a bit more diffuse than Ryan suggests. A web search for &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22went+the+fiddlers%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai=CADQPj6CtTLJSnPTKBNSPmI4FAAAAqgQFT9CwPYQ"&gt;"went the fiddlers"&lt;/a&gt; reveals that fiddlers have often been considered to go "fiddle fiddle dee fiddle dee", or perhaps "tweedle dum, tweedle dee", or maybe "twee tweedle dee tweedle dee",  Similar searches reveal that harpers go "twingle twangle", pipers go "ha-diddle, how-diddle" or perhaps "tootle tootle too", flutes go "toodle-oodle-oo", or maybe "Too-too, too-tum-too, tooty-tum", or just plain "toot toot".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for guitars, they go "twang", don't they? And theremins go "woo" (perhaps &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2010/05/the_origins_of_woo.php"&gt;the origin of the term as used for dubious science&lt;/a&gt;). Certain kinds of rock bands go "unn-tss unn-tss" or "unce unce". And let's not forget "oom pah pah".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also find less obvious things like "Bum-bum-bum went the guitars and tambourine in unison".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think that Ryan is right, the English inventory of instrument-imitation words is a bit sparse, and rarely includes ways of imitating ensembles.  I'll leave it to commenters to tell us about the situation in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don&amp;#39;t think that we&amp;#39;ve covered this topic before — though there have been some discussions of differences across languages in onomatopeia and ideophones, e.g. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001238.html"&gt;'Ho ho ho', she laughed in a refined feminine way&lt;/a&gt;", 7/21/2004; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001382.html"&gt;Hot features&lt;/a&gt;", 8/24/2004; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001234.html"&gt;Unh, Ka-BOOM, BZZURKK&lt;/a&gt;", 7/21/2004;  "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001238.html"&gt;Phonics&lt;/a&gt;", 12/30/2006; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005437.html"&gt;Ask Language Log: Sounds and Meanings&lt;/a&gt;", 3/9/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=64"&gt;Waza waza&lt;/a&gt;", 3/20/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=387"&gt;Japanese (and Chinese) onomatopeia&lt;/a&gt;", 7/21/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2342"&gt;Unce&lt;/a&gt;", 5/22/2010; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2419"&gt;Wait Till You Hear a Weak Pyridaben Carbazole Sound&lt;/a&gt;", 6/30/2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those French and their horns, Wikipedia explains that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;When valves were invented [in the 19th century] the French made smaller horns with piston valves and the Germans made larger horns with rotary valves.

The Bilderberg Group is an annual meeting of influential people from government, business, and economics from the United States and Western Europe, who gather unofficially to discuss issues facing the West. Consequently, conspiracy theorists default to their usual belief that any such gathering is planning Global Domination and is actually the secret world government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that this new information will do anything to change those beliefs, but it’s interesting for the rest of us. As you may know, WikiLeaks is an anonymously held web site that publishes classified documents, to the chagrin of governments and secret-holders everywhere. The Bilderberg Group does take minutes of their meetings, but as they are the private property of the Group, they are never made public. Somehow, somebody got ahold of the minutes from some of their earlier meetings and posted them.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the URLs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the courage to read through them, you’ll notice two things. First, names are omitted. The Bilderberg Group never records the identities of speakers, as a way to encourage uninhibited discussion. This is in accordance with a policy called the Chatham House Rule. The lists of each meeting’s attendees is, however, publicly released by the Bilderberg Group and they’re all available &lt;a href="http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/"&gt;on their web site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you’ll note that they’re not very interesting. A lot of world politics stuff is discussed, and just as the Group states, they do not make any decisions or issue any orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet if you ask a conspiracy theorist if there’s anything that could change their mind regarding their belief that the Bilderbergers are the secret world government, they’ll probably say no (the definition of a closed mind). Those few who might answer yes would probably tell you that reading the actual minutes of a Bilderberg meeting could change their mind. Well, here’s your chance. Let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too bad I wasn’t aware of this resource when I wrote the episode, it would have been a great addition.

This is not completely egregious, as big moneywinners like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/08/10/world-series-poker-theorist/"&gt;Michael Binger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/dutch-physicist-wins-wsop-title-$570-960-194262"&gt;Marcel Vonk&lt;/a&gt; are card-carrying (as it were) Ph.D. physicists.  Vonk on the relative merits of hypothetically winning the Nobel Prize or the World Series of Poker: “I would choose to win the Nobel Prize. But, it’s close.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there’s always much more to a good story than can be squeezed into a print magazine.  So if you want the background scoop, see &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2010/10/physicists-put-on-their-poker-face.html"&gt;Cocktail Party Physics&lt;/a&gt;.  Where, unfortunately, I’m (accurately) quoted as saying something in &lt;a href="http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004/05/world-series.html"&gt;an old blog post&lt;/a&gt; that really isn’t true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Texas Hold ‘Em is so popular because it manages to accurately hit the mark between ‘enough information to devise a consistently winning strategy’ and ‘not enough information to do much more than guess.’ The charm in such games is that there is no perfect strategy, in the sense that there is no algorithm guaranteed to win in the long run against any other algorithm. The best poker players are able to use different algorithms against different opponents as the situation warrants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two out of three sentences there are correct (which wouldn’t be such a bad average at a poker table, but is pretty lame in writing).  The first sentence is right; what makes Hold ‘Em such a popular poker variant is that you know enough to do more than guess, but not enough to easily reduce the problem to a simple algorithm.  But the second sentence is wrong, as written, at least under the perfectly reasonable reading that “win” includes “or tie.”  One of John Nash’s major contributions to game theory was to prove, under reasonable assumptions, the existence of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance"&gt;dominant strategies&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, it’s not the opponents that are being dominated — it’s the other strategies a player might contemplate using.  And “dominate” doesn’t mean “beat under any circumstances”; it just means “there is no alternative strategy that does better against every possible opponent strategy.”  Since the rules of poker (integrated over all seats at the table etc.) are the same for every player, every player has the same dominant strategy — which means that there exists a strategy such that, if everyone used it, their expected returns would all be equal, and none of them could unilaterally change their strategy to improve on that expectation.  Texas Hold ‘Em is sufficiently complex that the dominant strategy certainly isn’t known in closed form, but it does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I was clumsily aiming for in that sentence was the correct sentiment expressed in the last sentence.  While a dominant strategy is in some sense “least bad” against the complete set of possible opponent’s strategies, it’s certainly not guaranteed to be the best against every specific opponent.  If you know that your opponent deviates from dominant strategy in some particular way (not folding enough to re-raises pre-flop, for example), you will make the most money by choosing to deviate from dominant strategy yourself, in such a way as to take advantage of your opponent’s weakness.  That’s the idea behind &lt;em&gt;exploitative&lt;/em&gt; strategies, as advocated by Chris Ferguson in Jennifer’s blog post.  Good poker is all about being exploitative.  Any surprise that it’s a popular game among politicians?&lt;/p&gt;

Consider the following:

(1) Sally hates Mary.

a. How likely is this because Sally is the kind of person who hates people?

b. How likely is this because Mary is the kind of person whom people hate?

Sally hates Mary doesn&amp;#39;t obviously supply the relevant information, but starting with work by Roger Brown and Debora Fish in 1983, numerous studies have found that people nonetheless rate (a) as more likely than (b). In contrast, people find Sally frightens Mary more indicative of Sally than of Mary (the equivalent of rating (b) higher than (a)). Sentences like Sally likes Mary are called “object-biased,” and sentences like Sally frightens Mary are called “subject-biased.” There are many of sentences of both types.

Brown and Fish, along with many of the researchers who followed them, explain this in terms of an inference from knowledge about how the world works:

Consider the two verbs flatter and slander… Just about everyone (most or all persons) can be flattered or slandered. There is no special prerequisite. It is always possible to be the object of slander or flattery … By sharp contrast, however, not everyone, by any means, not even most or, perhaps, many are disposed to flatter or to slander… [Thus] to know that one party to an interaction is disposed to flatter is to have some basis for predicting flattery whereas to know only that one party can be flattered is to know little more than that that party is human. (Brown and Fish 1983, p. 265)Similar results are found by using other ways of asking about who is at fault:

(2) Sally hates Mary.

a. Who is most likely responsible?   Sally or Mary?

(The photo on the right came up on Flickr when I searched for pictures about &amp;quot;causes&amp;quot;. It turns out Flickr is not a good place to look for pictures about &amp;quot;hating,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;frightening,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;causes&amp;quot;. But I liked this picture.)

Understanding Pronouns

Now consider:

(3) Sally hates Mary because she...

(4) Sally frightens Mary because she...

Most people think that &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; refers to Mary in (3) but Sally in (4). This is a bias -- not absolute -- but it is robust and easy to replicate. Again, there are many verbs which are &amp;quot;object-biased&amp;quot; like hates and many which are &amp;quot;subject-biased&amp;quot; like frightens. Just as in the causal attribution effect above, this pronoun effect seems to be a systematic effect of (at least) the verb used. This fact was first discovered by Catherine Garvey and Alfonso Caramazza in the mid-70s and has been studied extensively first.

The typical explanation of the pronoun effect is that the word &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; implies that you are about to get an explanation of what just happened. Explanations usually refer to causes. So you expect the clause starting with she to refer to the cause of first part of the sentence. Therefore, people must think that Mary caused Sally hates Mary but Sally caused Sally frightens Mary.

Causes and Pronouns

Both effects are called &amp;quot;implicit causality,&amp;quot; and researchers have generally assumed that the causal attribution effect and the pronoun effect are basically one and the same. An even stronger version of this claim would be that the pronoun effect relies on the causal attribution effect. People resolve the meaning of the pronouns in (3) and (4) based on who they think the cause of the first part of the sentence is. The causal attribution task in (1) and (2) is supposed to measure exactly that: who people think the cause is.

Although people have been doing this research for around three decades, nobody seems to have actually checked whether this is true -- that is, are verbs that are subject-biased in terms of causal attribution also subject-biased in terms of pronoun interpretation?

I recently ran a series of three studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk to answer this question. The answer is &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;

This figure shows the relationship between causal attribution biases (positive numbers mean the verb is subject-biased, negative means its object-biased) and pronoun biases (100 = completely subject-biased, 0 = completely object-biased). Though there is a trend line in the right direction, it&amp;#39;s essentially artifactual. I tested four different types of verbs (the details of the verb classes take longer to explain than they are interesting), and it happens that none of them were subject-biased in terms of pronoun interpretation but object-biased in terms of causal attribution (good thing, since otherwise I would have had nowhere to put the legend). There probably are some such verbs; I just only tested a few types.

I ran three different experiments using somewhat different methods, and all gave similar results (that&amp;#39;s Experiment 2 above).

More evidence

A number of previous studies showed that causal attribution is affected by who the subject and object are. For instance, people are more object-biased in interpreting The boss hated the employee than for The employee hated the boss. That is, they seem to think that whether the boss is more likely to be the cause whether the boss is the one hating or hated. This makes some sense: bosses are in a better position to effect employees than vice versa.

I was able to find this effect in my causal attribution experiments, but there was no effect on pronoun resolution. That is, people thought &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; referred to the employee in (5) and the boss in (6) at pretty much the same rate.

(5) The boss hated the employee.

(6) The employee hated the boss.

Conclusion

This strongly suggests that these two effects are two different effects, due to different underlying mechanisms. I think this will come as a surprise to most people who have studied these effects in the past. It also is a surprise in terms of what we know about language processing. There is lots of evidence that people use any and all relevant information when they are interpreting language. Why aren&amp;#39;t people using the conceptualization of the world as revealed by the causal attribution task when interpreting pronouns? And what are people doing when they interpret pronouns in these contexts?

I do have the beginnings of an answer to the latter question, but since  the data in this experiment doesn&amp;#39;t speak it, that will have to wait for a future post.

&lt;p&gt;The latest news, &lt;a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/10/113_74114.html"&gt;in the Korea Times&lt;/a&gt;, no less, is that the rumors of the tribe's having chosen Hangeul as their offical script were not only premature, they were downright false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here are the first few paragraphs of the article, by Lee Tae-hun, entitled "Hangeul didn’t become Cia Cia’s official writing" and with the revealing subtitle "Mistranslation causes media hype over Korean writing system":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the media hype, the Cia Cia tribe, a group of 70,000 on the remote Indonesian island of Bau-bau, has neither received central government approval for the adoption of Hangeul as its writing system, nor has it made such a request, sources told The Korea Times Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mayor has not requested the government’s approval for the adoption of Hangeul,” Ibnu Wahid, an official from Bau-bau, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hangeul was taught for a total of 37 hours to some 50 fourth graders last year at an elementary school in Bau-bau and now it is being taught to some 190 students in two schools, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribe gained attention over the past year for allegedly being the first foreign ethnic group to officially adopt Hangeul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July this year, a host of media outlets ran stories claiming that Bau-bau Mayor Amirul Tamim said the Indonesian government had finally authorized the adoption of Hangeul as the tribe’s official alphabet to preserve their dying language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chun Tai-hyun, a professor of Malay and Indonesian linguistics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, points out that those reports were groundless and based on a mistranslation of Tamim’s comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mayor Tamim only mentioned that official discussions have begun and he was consulting with the central government over the adoption of Hangeul in a media interview,” he said. “However, the media wrongfully translated his remark as if he had received formal acknowledgement from the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down in the article, we find that "The Cia-Cia is one of some 700 Indonesian tribes which use the Roman alphabet, the official writing system of the country, as they only have their spoken language."  As stated, this is ambiguous, since the first part of the sentence says that the Cia-Cia use the Roman alphabet, while the second part implies that they only have a spoken language.  Even Professor Chun Tai-hyun, who originally proposed the adoption of Hangeul to the Bau-Bau mayor in 2007, admits that it is unlikely for Hangeul ever to be adopted by the Cia-Cia as their official writing system, since Indonesia's Basic Law stipulates that all tribal languages be recorded in Roman letters to preserve national unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed?  Or will there be a "Hangeul for Cia-Cia, part IV" half a year from now?&lt;/p&gt;

Your attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, is on an absurd crusade against Michael Mann and the University of Virginia. His previous attempt to defame Mann with accusations of fraud was recently shot down in the courts, but now he has &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/05/AR2010100504908.html"&gt;thrown another pile of accusations at him, all just as pointless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general's logic is so tenuous as to leave only one plausible explanation: that he is on a fishing expedition designed to intimidate and suppress honest research and the free exchange of ideas upon which science and academia both depend -- all because he does not like what science says about climate change. Among other things, the attorney general demands that U-Va. turn over any correspondence it may have between Mr. Mann and 39 other scientists. Mr. Mann points out that among those Mr. Cuccinelli did not list by name are the two other researchers on the African savannah research grant that the attorney general is supposedly investigating.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What is this farce costing? To defend itself from Mr. Cuccinelli's investigation into the distribution of a $214,700 research grant, the University of Virginia has spent $350,000, with more to come, and that doesn't count the taxpayer funds Mr. Cuccinelli is devoting to this cause. Sadly, though, that's the smallest of the costs. The damage to Virginia's reputation, and to its universities' ability to attract and retain top-notch faculty and students, will not be easily undone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that a recall is long past due, and that someone ought to sic an army of lawyers on the real phony here: Ken Cuccinelli.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/isnt_this_an_abuse_of_power.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/c3S6Be3KL5g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286420587115"><id gr:original-id="http://yalikedags.southernfriedscience.com/?p=246">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93c8fe5b447dad2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sharks and Trophic Cascades: Cut and Dry?</title><published>2010-10-06T22:00:26Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T22:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/8808gW6vNzs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://yalikedags.southernfriedscience.com/?p=246"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A recent post over at Chronicles of Zostera referenced a paper that has become a monster in the world of marine ecology and shark conservation.  That paper: Myers et al.

&lt;p&gt;Matthew recently asked&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/is-there-life-on-gliese-581g/"&gt; if there is life on Gliese 581g&lt;/a&gt;– a newly discovered Earth-like (in some ways) planet (I’m tempted to say “&lt;a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Class_M"&gt;class M planet&lt;/a&gt;“).  There’s also the question of&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/life/looking/"&gt; if there is life in the Solar System&lt;/a&gt; (Earth doesn’t count)– on &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/01/et-life/"&gt;Europa, or Mars, or Enceladus, say&lt;/a&gt;. On the same trip that I got to see the Hall of Human Origins at the USNM, I also visited the Smithsonian’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/"&gt;Air and Space Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and got to see the candidate planets and moons up close and personal. There I saw the exhibit “&lt;a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gal211/beyond.cfm"&gt;Beyond: Visions of Our Solar System&lt;/a&gt;“, a series of exquisite photographs compiled by &lt;a href="http://www.beyondexhibition.net/splash/flash/"&gt;Michael Benson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19942" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/is-there-life-in-the-solar-system/dscn1767/"&gt;&lt;img title="Beyond" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn1767.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond title signage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiled from the photographic results of what is now several decades of interplanetary probes and Earth satellites, the exhibit includes images of all the planets, the Sun, many moons, and a number of asteroids (a &lt;a href="http://www.beyondexhibition.net/exhibits/pdf/Beyond_Images_Captions.pdf"&gt;catalogue&lt;/a&gt;, with images, is available on Benson’s website, as is a wonderful set of &lt;a href="http://www.beyondexhibition.net/exhibits/gallery/nasm/index.html"&gt;wide angle views of the exhibit hall&lt;/a&gt;). The exhibit is, in a word, magnificent. The large format prints, placed on the walls without intervening cases, allows the visitor to examine every detail of the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19943" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/is-there-life-in-the-solar-system/dscn1772/"&gt;&lt;img title="Images of Mars" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn1772.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of Mars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detail and high resolution turn the planets from objects of astronomy– moving points of light– to objects of geology, and even hydrology– out wash plains and hills, volcanoes and glaciers. They’re not quite objects of biology yet.  We, or our machines, will have to investigate on the surface more closely to see if that’s the case. Here are a few more of the over 100 images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recommend this exhibit without reservation. It will be at Air &amp;amp; Space till next May.  A companion volume of exquisite photos, &lt;a href="http://www.beyondexhibition.net/books/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Abrams, New York, 2003) is available. (The exhibit contains newer photos, as well as ones from the book, some as recent as 2009.)&lt;/p&gt;

How does this happen?  I daresay in this case English is not the first language of the author who penned the majority of the text (two authors are from India and one from Korea).  That’s fine. I get that, but the editorial process exists to improve the manuscript before errors resulting from English as a second language find their way into print.  The editorial process involves peer review as a check and balance for the quality of the science and editorial review to ensure that the message is not miscommunicated.  In this case the latter part (at least) failed miserably.

Looking more closely at the manuscript, I think there’s another hint in the Article Info section as to how this happened.  The manuscript was received by the editors on Dec 11, 2009, received in modified form on February 26, 2010, accepted the same day and subsequently made available online on March 6, 2010.  That’s 3 months turnaround, or more accurately 60 business days from submission to print.  This is surely a record during a time of year when most editors and reviewers are on vacation for a significant chunk of time due to the end of year holidays.  Hmmm…

Why am I so annoyed about this?  I guess because, as a reader, I am unable to get at what I want (the science) because I am either distracted by or confused by problems in the presentation of the manuscript, an admittedly selfish argument.  Its also galling (and this is the petulant side of me) because I’ve had manuscripts put through the scientific and editorial ringer to the n-th degree for 18 months or more over the slightest detail, while these (no doubt well-meaning) folks are able to get a poor manuscript published within the lifespan of your average Christmas tree.  I know, I know, Waah Waah waah, poor mistreated me.  Truth is, it’s better for science that we all suffer some intermediate degree of scrutiny, rather than deploying intense effort on a few while others get a seeming free pass.  I guess its the inescapable bell-curve effect: if you assume that editorial effort is distributed on a bell curve, then some folks will cop it all, while others get away with close to none.  The biggest reason, though, that this sort of thing can’t be allowed to happen is for what it means about the science.  If we are so cavalier with the language of a manuscript, what sort of scientific review is it getting?  How can we be confident about the conclusions drawn if the way it’s written suggests that it only received a lip-service of a review?

I can’t see how this is anything other than a failure of the entire editorial system.  Someone among the sequence - the receiving section editor, the reviewers, or the managing editor when it came time for the final up-down vote - should have said “Wait a minute, is someone going to say something about this?”.  Evidently that didn’t happen and its a shame, becuase it implies a certain apathy towards the work and, as a result, the journal is worse off for it, the authors aren’t helped by it, and science as a whole suffers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Druidry, an ancient Celtic belief that worships deities who take their forms in nature, has been given the official status of a ‘religion’ in Britain. It is a form of neo-paganism, along with Wicca, Voodoo and Shamanism. Surprisingly enough the belief system is already provided with tax-exempt religious group status in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Neo-pagans seek to communicate with spirits, but witchcraft is not satanic because its believers don’t recognize the Satan of Christianity, Judaism or Islam.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm… right. I don’t understand how anyone could call Satan silly … and then turn right around to talk to “spirits.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it made me think of this picture I took during a recent visit to Lynchburg, Virginia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo1-410x550.jpg" alt="" title="DruidRoad" width="410" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the local Druid Grove of the Seven Hills, ADF has adopted a street… right next to Thomas Road.  Which is where Jerry Falwell’s original Thomas Road Baptist Church still remains.  The church is about a one minute walk away from the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta love that placement.&lt;br&gt;

There were 1774 comments by noon today! I picked a random number using random.org and got 1749. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/04/bad-universe-episode-2-swag-giveaway/#comment-315659"&gt;That belonged to Paul C&lt;/a&gt;, whom I notified by email. He replied with an address, and the loot will be mailed to him tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t fret. I have a lot of stuff sitting on my shelf I want to give away, including copies of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/18/trebuchet-catapults-into-the-world/"&gt;George Hrab’s latest CD&lt;/a&gt;, as well as swag from Episode 3! That’s not been scheduled yet, so I don’t know exactly when the contest for that will be. Stay Tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have to add: when the number came up 1749 out of 1774, I had a very, very brief moment of &amp;quot;really?&amp;quot; Silly; I know that random numbers are, duh, random, and are exactly as likely to be 1 or 1774 as anything else. Still, that little credulous part of the brain never dies, and when it saw that the number chosen was only 1.4% away from one of the end points, it sparked a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; fallacy; seeing something asinteresting &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it happened. Had the number been, say 1724, would that have been as interesting? That’s still less than 3% from the endpoint. What about 1000 exactly, or 50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how a lot of psychics, snake oil salesmen, and other fantasy-peddlers make their money: drawing the target around the hole after the gun’s been fired. If you think something isn’t coincidence, you really need to have the targets drawn up before you do the shooting. Saying something is a hit without knowing beforehand what a hit really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, well, that’s cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I write this and post it, the premiere of Episode 2 is just a few hours away. Yay! And don’t forget, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;I’ll be live-tweeting the whole thing on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Go there to get some behind-the-scenes tales and — shocker — bad jokes and puns. &lt;/p&gt;

He's Han Solo, he's Indiana Jones, he's Richard Kimble, and he's so much more. He's been manlier longer than most men could even hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for starters, he's got a better sarcastic "fuck you" smile than just about anyone out there. It's truly amazing how a Harrison Ford smirk can just suck all the hope out of you when its directed your way. He has a smirk that can say, variably, "I'm going to shoot you now," "I'm going to chop down this bridge here," or even "You'll want to bone me eventually, Princess. Just you wait and see."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add that to his killer dry sense of humor and his many manly movies and you have someone who is, indisputably, The Man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Positive:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Han Fuckin' Solo, baby&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Henry Jones, Jr.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excuse me.

WTF, Harrison?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That one earring in his left ear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/images/harrison-ford-int-2.jpg"&gt;This hairdo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He actually gives a shit about that lame-ass walking greeting card the Dalai Lama&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totally phoning it in in &lt;i&gt;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/i&gt;. The movie might have been marginally better if he had actually played Indy instead of playing Harrison Ford playing Indy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Homicide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Star Wars Holiday Special&lt;/i&gt;. But given his reaction in the YouTube clip linked above, we can't really hold this one against him too much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He once criticized Hollywood for making violent movies. Yeah, the guy from &lt;i&gt;Air Force One&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Let's get the important part out of the way first: Han shot first. Fuck George Lucas in his ear. Han shot first. Han shot first because that bitch Greedo was going to kill him, and he had things to do. That doesn't make him a bad &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt;, it makes him a bad&lt;i&gt;ass&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And do you know the genesis of the awesome "shoot the dude with the giant sword" scene in &lt;i&gt;Raiders&lt;/i&gt;? Harrison was sick and had been shitting water for days, and when the time came to do the elaborate stuntwork that had been written for the scene, Mr. Ford basically said "Fuck this, I'm sick. Can I just shoot him?" What resulted was one of the finest scenes in film history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to real-life Harrison Ford. He's a pilot, which is fucking manly in and of itself. But he owns all sorts of planes, and none of them are a DC-10 because he's not a fucking Scientologist like some other Hollywood pilots. He can fly a multitude of aircraft, including helicopters. Hell, he once crashed a helicopter and walked away no worse for wear. And you know what he likes to do with his ability to fly a chopper? He volunteers as a rescue chopper pilot. That's right: someday, you might be lost while hiking in Wyoming, and get picked up and strapped to a gurney by Harrison fucking Ford, who's doing it because it's the right motherfucking thing to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why Wyoming? Because Mr. Ford spends most of his time on a humongous estate in rural Wyoming, far from the peeping eyes of dipshit paparazzi. Unlike most other celebrities, who are worthless human beings with self-esteem issues, Harrison is an &lt;i&gt;actor&lt;/i&gt;, and when he's off camera he has no inherent need to have people staring at him. Hell, he'd rather they didn't. He's content to chill out on his 400 acres with Ally McBeal and do good deeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holy shit, I just put this together. Harrison Ford is intensely private, which is to say that he guards himself and his identity from others. He rescues people from danger because merely because he's a stand-up guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A secret identity + Saving people = Harrison Ford is a superhero. QED.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's also got a history of manly work. Hell, he was cast as Han Solo while working as a carpenter. He was just supposed to read other people's lines in between hammering nails into boards, and he was so good that he got the part over everyone else. I wouldn't be surprised if he built the house he currently lives in with his bare hands. By now he probably doesn't even need tools. He knocked the trees over with the power of his manliness, fed them through a helicopter rotor to make some lumber, and pounded the nails in with his fists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, Harrison Ford is The Man. If you disagree, you are wrong.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-4757949766131422242?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286403802642"><id gr:original-id="http://professorkateclancy.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-ivf-story-after-conception-being.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef17fa9cef9f20fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">My IVF story: after conception, being preggers</title><published>2010-10-06T17:04:15Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T17:04:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/DCGsTaXLO4s/my-ivf-story-after-conception-being.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://professorkateclancy.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-ivf-story-after-conception-being.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">This is the second post of four on my experience with IVF and pregnancy, and my thinking on its broader meaning to the public and to anthropology. Find the first post here.PreggersA few weeks after the positive blood test, I had my ultrasound where we saw a tiny little bean and a beating heart. During this time I was having what felt like bad menstrual cramps. The nurse told me this was quite normal, but I still spent a lot of mental energy fretting over it. The rest of the first trimester was pretty uncomfortable. In addition to being exhausted, I was nauseous. I didn’t want to eat vegetables. In fact, all I really wanted was toast (gluten free, of course). I concocted a pretty awesome smoothie that I would drink once or twice a day, made of chocolate almond milk, peanut butter and ice cubes. It settled my stomach, and it’s probably because of those smoothies that I only lost four pounds.At this point we also transitioned from medical doctor care to a midwife. At first we were just given to the next available midwife in our practice. But when it became clear that in order to stay in that practice we’d have to have a hospital birth, we transferred to the Cambridge Birth Center in Cambridge, MA and the midwives there.Where to give birth and whyThe Cambridge Birth Center is a stand-alone birth center associated with (and across the street from) the Cambridge Hospital. There are no doctors, but you can get into the OR in four minutes for an emergency C-section if you need to (yes, they practice and time these things). So I was completely confident that, if I had a straightforward, low-risk pregnancy and labor, I would be best suited to the birth center, and if anything went wrong I was minutes from a doctor.We were a bit nervous about this decision, because of the stigma attached to IVF children. Do IVF pregnancies lead to more difficult pregnancies or labors? Are we going to have a child with greater or fewer limbs than the average? The reality is that, while the egg was fertilized in a rather special manner, a fertilized egg, then blastocyst, trophoblast, and so on that makes it to become a fetus, and then makes it trouble-free through the first trimester? That fetus is very, very likely to be healthy and normal.The other reason we were firm in our decision is that a number of interventions that are automatic upon entering a hospital are not physiologically necessary, and even increase the risk of later interventions. Pubic hair shaving is still a common practice in some hospitals, which is just plain dehumanizing. More common are continuous fetal monitoring and putting in an IV immediately. Continuous fetal monitoring is more likely to find false positives, which means it’s more likely to find pathology in a fetal heartbeat that goes up or down but resolves on its own naturally. IVs restrict movement and lower the barrier for a doctor to suggest, and a woman to agree to, pharmaceutical interventions. This is in addition to the many other criticisms I could launch but won’t because I find it all so exhausting.The biggest issue, for me, is that if you walk into a hospital you have at least a 33% chance of having a Cesarean section, and the reasons behind that are largely related to the ratcheting up of interventions as one intervention necessitates the next one. A C-section is major abdominal surgery. It takes a long time to recover. It is hard to breastfeed, it is hard to pick up your child, and you spend more days in the hospital. These are days when your sleep is more disrupted than when you’re home, and you increase your and your child’s chances of infection by being in a hospital, and extra days when you as a family could be figuring out a routine at home to make sure the mother isn’t the only one bonding to the new baby.Then there are indications that C-sections create health concerns for the baby as she gets older. Babies of C-sections have higher rates of allergy (i.e., Roduit et al 2009), asthma (i.e., Davidson et al 2010) and Celiac (gluten intolerance) (Decker et al 2010). I am a C-section baby myself and I have severe allergies, allergy-induced asthma, and gluten intolerance (a trifecta of awesomeness!). Given that I’ll be passing on some of the genetic proclivities for these things, I wasn’t too keen on giving my child the environmental components that would also increase her risk if I could avoid it.So we started seeing a midwife, and I got to know a different part of Cambridge better than I’d known before. I really fell in love with Inman Square.Going metaThroughout my pregnancy, I devoured popular books on pregnancy (good: anything by Sheila Kitzinger, bad: What to Expect When You’re Expecting) but also searched for a lot of information on PubMed and kept an Endnote library devoted to my results. I read about the craptastic relationship between symphysis-fundal height measurements (this is when they use measuring tape to measure the size of your belly) and birth weight (i.e., Johnstone et al 1996) – even in those studies that found a statistical correlation, SFH often explained very little of the variance in birth weight. I read about exercise during pregnancy (de Groot et al 1994) – and I played soccer through my first trimester, jogged through my second, and worked out five days a week through the whole pregnancy, up to the day before my due date. I read about meconium, I read about fetal monitoring, I read about maternal stress. When I wasn’t working I was reading, and when I wasn’t reading I was exercising. All the other time I was in prenatal appointments or sleeping.Of course, as excruciatingly long as the pregnancy felt, as boring and normal and yet delightful as it was, it did eventually come to a close. Family flew in from out of town to be around for my due date, and there was a lot of pressure – joking, but pressure nonetheless – to produce offspring before everyone left. When my due date brought with it the occasional half-hearted contraction, nothing I hadn’t felt before, I went to bed disappointed.The next morning I woke up, got out of bed, and my water broke all over the bedroom floor.* * *Next time, I’ll talk about the joys of drug-free labor.ReferencesDavidson, R., Roberts, S., Wotton, C., &amp;amp; Goldacre, M.

Why would there be higher neuroticism in young adults compared to older adults and decreases in extraversion and openness as one grows older, cross-culturally no less? The authors offer up some explanations such as a combination of maturational, cultural, cohort and sampling effects. They also mention genetic and evolutionary influences and this is what I am particularly interested in. We know that genes are influenced by evolutionary processes and that brain development is affected by gene expression. I suggest that brain development provides the perfect explanatory mechanism for such changes in personality traits across the life span.  Generally, the authors found an increased level of neuroticism in the 18-21 year old range, a sensitive time wrought with angst ridden existential dilemmas. This makes sense because frontal lobes, responsible for executive functioning and emotional control are still in development (NIMH). Neurotics tend to respond poorly to environmental stress, interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and are more impulsive. These personality characteristics map well to frontal lobes that have not been fully developed.The authors also found that adults 50+ years old evidenced lower extraversion and openness and higher agreeableness and conscientiousness.   Studies have shown that extraverts demonstrate increased sensitivity to reward signals and novelty seeking, suggesting that dopaminergic system is involved (Cohen et al., 2005; Golimbet et. al, 2007). One study found that striatal D2 receptor availability predicted socially desirable responding (Reeves et al., 2007). Additionally, age-related decline in dopamine D2 receptors is evident (Volkow et al, 1996, 2000). Taken together these studies may offer up one piece of the explanatory puzzle as to why extraversion drops in older adults. Openness to experience has been suggested to map well with the orbitofrontal cortex, an area known for decision-making, reward processing and emotional processing (Sutin et al., 2009 ). An absence of the posterior orbital sulcus (a part of the orbitofrontal cortex) in healthy subjects has been positively associated with openness to experience (Roppongi et al., 2010). Interestingly, older adults evidence tissue loss in the orbitofrontal cortex, perhaps explaining the decrease in openness to experience in later adulthood (Resnick, Lamar, &amp;amp; Driscoll, 2007). In terms of agreeablness, one study found that smaller right orbitofrontal lobe volume was associated with low agreeableness while smaller left orbitofrontal volume was correlated with high agreeableness in patients with frontaltemporal dementia (Rankin et al., 2004). Perhaps in normal aging the left orbitofrontal cortex in particular shows tissue loss.Regarding conscientiousness, Jackson, Belota, and Head (2009) discovered that those who were rated as higher on this personality trait showed larger regional volumes in prefrontal and mediotemporal regions and less decline with advanced aging.  The influence of brain development on cross-cultural personality changes in the context of aging, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, is well worth considering. However, one should not forget about all the other important pieces of the puzzle (i.e. maturational, cultural, cohort and sampling effects). Needless to say, further research needs to be done in order to shed light on this intriguing link between personality and the aging brain.

One thing that bugs Ophelia, as it bugs me, is the maddening reluctance of Gnu critics to name the supposed miscreants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angry reaction doesn’t have much use for accurate and careful –  angry reaction is trying to shut down the opposition, not make it  better. If you don’t believe me, just Google a name or two along with  “New Atheism” – try Michael Ruse, Andrew Brown, Madeleine Bunting, Mark  Vernon, Barney Zwartz, Chris Hedges, Karen Armstrong, Chris Mooney, to  name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this situation – this dispute – is an  artefact of the internet. Anything written can be instantly discussed;  factions form, then groupthink and othering come into play. Blogs are  notoriously liable to this. I’ve seen (and sometimes been part of) many  blog arguments about the putative evils of New Atheism in which, when  pressed to give actual examples of militant strident aggressive new  atheism, the critic will cite comments on a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least we  know where we are when that happens. Blog comments, especially on  popular sites, can very quickly generate an atmosphere of mobbing,  simply because most regular readers share a point of view. But that is a  feature of blog comments and the internet more generally, not of new  atheism as such. The picture is further confused because New Atheism can  mean the big four (Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, Hitchens), or the big four  plus some others, or all of them plus all avowed explicit outspoken  atheists. Worst of all, it can mean the big four plus all drive-by  shouters on the internet. It is seldom made explicit which is meant, and  the result is that critics often oscillate between various meanings  without notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come on, ye critics like Phil Plait and Caspar Melville—put up or shut up.  Atheism thrives on evidence, not innuendo.  These criticisms without attached names remind me of Joe McCarthy’s never-revealed lists of Communists in the State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been three years to the day since I started AutismNewsBeat. You can see my first post &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Much has changed since then, mostly for the better. Top notch investigations by the &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1196"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=desperate-for-an-autism-cure"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/856"&gt;PBS Frontline&lt;/a&gt;, and others and shown a light on the anti-vaccine movement. Master prestidigitators &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1225"&gt;Penn and Teller&lt;/a&gt; exposed the dishonesty of vaccine rejectionists and the quack autism cure industry. Vaccine scientist Dr. Paul Offit published &lt;em&gt;Autism’s False Prophets&lt;/em&gt;, which helped created a more realistic news narrative, and Alison Singer created the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who visits my website, and special thanks to the open-minded editors and reporters who eschew false balance and baseless assumptions, as they write about this complicated and important subject. And thanks to my son, Christopher, who was diagnosed 12 years ago with autistic disorder, for teaching me more than I can put in words.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;a href="http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fautism-news-beat.com%2Farchives%2F1236"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
				&lt;img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Fautism-news-beat.com%2Farchives%2F1236&amp;amp;style=normal" height="61" width="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt; reporters, writing in the &lt;a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-09-30/news/crist-backer-gary-kompothecras-bullies-florida-health-officials/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miami New Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, report that Florida Governor Charlie Crist has fallen under the Rasputin-like spell of a rogue chiropractor, Gary Kompothecras, the founder of 1-800-ASKGARY, a lawyer referral service that hooks up car crash victims with personal injury lawyers. Kompothecras, of Sarasota, is also a major Crist donor, and now he’s calling in some favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…it’s bound to turn heads when the man known to occasionally lend his private jet to the governor uses his political clout to try to bully Florida health officials into turning over scores of the state’s sealed immunization records. Especially when they’re for a father-son team, Dr. Mark and David Geier, infamous for injecting autistic children with Lupron, a drug used to chemically castrate prostate cancer patients and pedophiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will be speaking to the governor’s office next week,” Kompothecras, who has served on the Governor’s Task Force on Autism Spectrum Disorders since 2008, wrote in his email. “I will even fly up to Tallahassee to sit down with the governors’ chief of staff and explain in detail the railroad we have been on.” Then he signed off with a demand and a threat: “I want a clear, precise time line now!! Govern yourselves accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kompothecras knows his way around Tallahassee, and he knows how to buy access. In 2008, he reportedly donated about $40,000 to individual candidates, and more than $110,000 to the passage of Crist’s property tax cut plan, Amendment 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According VV reporters Penn Bullock Brandon K. Thor, a source has told them Crist’s office has been pressuring health department officials to meet to the Geiers’ demands. “Turning over the sealed immunization records, the source says, would be ‘reckless, careless, shortsighted, and politically motivated.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Kompothecras paid lawmakers to push SB 242, which would have given parents  authority to delay vaccinating their children against dangerous diseases such measles, mumps and polio. Kompothecras has two children with autism, for which he blames vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090423/article/904231071"&gt;Crist supported the bill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You see reports about mercury in fish and how that’s detrimental to our health,” Crist said. “To me it’s a fairly logical, not illogical, extension to feel that if mercury is bad for you when it comes in the form of fish, it’s probably not good for you if it comes in the form of a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more troubling is that Kompothecras’ largesse has landed him a seat on the Governor’s Task  Force for Autism Spectrum Disorder. The 2009 report, which you can download &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/www.doh.state.fl.us/AlternateSites/.../documents/FinalReport-2009_04.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, contains several questionable, evidence-free assertions. On page 44 we see a misleading reference to the Hannah Poling case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent case that received media attention suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition to autism that, when combined with environmental factors, triggers the onset of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next page, we are told&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest a correlation of oxidative stress14 with autism, and a higher level of oxidative stress correlated with exposure to heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report gives no citation for the “studies”, but does contain this footnote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and a biological system’s ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or easily repair the resulting cell and tissue damage. Some recent studies have demonstrated greater oxidative stress in children with autism, and that anti-oxidant nutrients may improve autistic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 47 we read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task Force members believe there may be promise in studying the incidence of unvaccinated children who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, the impact of mercury-containing/thimerosal-containing immunizations, and the impact of environmental factors (e.g., exposure to formaldehyde, aluminum, and certain foods) for a relationship to autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most troubling yet is Recommendation 18 – Alternative Immunization Schedules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rationale&lt;br&gt;
Providing families with alternative vaccination schedules may increase parental confidence in immunization programs by addressing their concerns. The inclusion of expert bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will ensure that any proposed alternative schedule balances the interest of individual families with the protection of vulnerable members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;
Proposed alternative vaccine schedules would be reviewed in collaboration with the scientific community. Any proposed alternative schedules would enable families to meet Florida state-mandated school immunization requirements. This will reduce any need that families may feel to obtain multiple vaccinations during a single medical visit in order to meet school requirements. Whichever governmental body (e.g., State Legislature or state agency) considers the specifics of an alternative vaccine schedule, that body should review examples of alternative schedule proposals (e.g., by Dr. William Sears or others). The Task Force further suggests that, at a minimum, Florida’s school entrance requirements permit families to vaccinate their children within the full range of ages currently recommended by the CDC and ACIP in the Recommended Immunization Schedules for Persons Aged 0 Through 18 Years21 to maximize parental options in the spacing of immunizations. For example, Florida requires a second MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine prior to kindergarten entry, at the usual age of five (5) years, while the Recommended Immunization Schedule recommends that the second dose be administered from four (4) to six (6) years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kompothecris’ fingerprints are unmistakable on R&lt;em&gt;ecommendation 19 — Mercury-Containing Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;, which cites “peer-reviewed, scientific literature” by the Geiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong difference of opinion with regard to potential correlations between mercury use and incidence of autism across scientific and parental communities. Some investigators have published new, peer-reviewed scientific literature* evaluated within the context of established epidemiological criteria that suggests a causal relationship between mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. These studies propose that exposure to mercury from thimerosal -containing vaccines occurs in utero and during infant years. Studies supporting an autism link further suggest that: 1) mercury poisoning causes symptoms consistent with autism, 2) mercury levels are higher in children with autism than in their unaffected peers, and 3) that animal modeling supports the correlation. These researchers conclude that a mercury–autism relationship is apparent. In light of the severity of autism spectrum disorders, its devastating lifelong impacts, and increasing prevalence rates of autism, medical researchers and families who support these studies strongly urge the precautionary removal of thimerosal from vaccines as soon as possible. They maintain that it is not in the best interest of children to expose pregnant and nursing mothers and infant children to any amount of avoidable mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “peer reviewed, scientific study” is  &lt;em&gt;A Case Series of Children with Apparent Mercury Toxic Encephalopathies Manifesting with Clinical Symptoms of Regressive Autistic Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, (2007), published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health&lt;/em&gt;. The Geiers list the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the study as the Institute for Chronic Illnesses. But the &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/98/"&gt;IRB was composed&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Geier, his son, his wife, his business  associate, a vaccine litigant lawyer, and two parents who are plaintiffs  in vaccine injury cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Crist locked in a three-way race for US Senate, news of his quack problem could tip control control of that chamber away from the Democrats. Then again, &lt;a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-21/news/chi-autism-lupron-may21_1_experts-in-childhood-hormones-potentially-damaging-treatment-lupron-protocol"&gt;with a few exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, the news and entertainment media have been largely silent on the issue of chemically castrating disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

Philip (and Ned Block) were valuable allies in the attacks on Jerry Fodor’s and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini’s anti-natural-selection nonsense.  And  I enjoyed (and blurbed) Kitcher’s most recent philosophy book,&lt;em&gt; Living with Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, a trenchant critique of intelligent design. In that book’s last chapter, Kitcher warns against too-strident critique of religion, arguing that faith provides a lot of social benefits to people, and that replacing faith means finding a humanism that dispenses those benefits.  That seemed reasonable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new piece in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, however, Kitcher has gone a bit further in his criticism of atheism. “&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2010.00500.x/full"&gt;Militant modern atheism” by Columbia philosopher Philip Kitcher&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; (access is free, and you can download a pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Dennett has written a response to Philip’s piece, and though it will ultimately appear elsewhere online, he’s given me permission to post it here. It’s longer than our usual posts but well worth reading. (Quotes in italics below are from Kitcher’s article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to some lengths in &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Spell &lt;/em&gt;to distinguish &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; spells one might consider breaking: the taboo against looking “too closely” at religion, holding it up to the same harsh light of rational probing to which we subject all other important phenomena,  and the spell of religion itself.  In my book I declared my intent to break the first spell and my agnosticism about the wisdom of breaking the second—citing the very considerations that Kitcher advances more positively.  Kitcher ignores my distinction but in fact is in nearly perfect harmony with my positions on them. His essay is an &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt; of breaking the first spell: he writes with unflinching candor about the shaky status of any religion adopted on what he calls the &lt;em&gt;belief model&lt;/em&gt;, and uses that spell-broken perspective to look hard at the prospects for keeping the second spell unbroken, by relying on what he calls the &lt;em&gt;orientation model, &lt;/em&gt;supposing that this is perhaps the only surviving mode of religion that can provide the benefits he wants to preserve, which may just be a necessity of meaningful life for many people.   As I noted in my book, there is a reasonable fear that breaking the first spell will inevitably break the second as well, which fear is the (obligatorily) tacit standard justification for not breaking the first.  Kitcher vividly illustrates that problem in his essay, trying to walk the tightrope without falling into patronizing on one side or uneasy complicity with unacceptable nonsense on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Kitcher’s introduction of the orientation model is to give him a way of reversing—most of the time—the otherwise standard dependence of serious commitments and aspirations on grounded beliefs.  The orientation-type religionists put commitments first, as the fundamental landmarks of their lives, and let the expression of (what take the place of) grounds for these commitments wander somewhat opportunistically between  “mythically self-conscious”  metaphor at one pole and “doctrinal “entanglement” (flirting with the belief model) at the other, with convenient vagueness in the middle. (The “doctrinally indefinite” folks “take refuge in language that is resonant and opaque, metaphorical and poetic, and deny that they can do any better at explaining the beliefs they profess.”) Whatever floats your boat, as one says. And indeed, if maintaining a religious orientation is the only way for you to have a meaningful life, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; rely on whatever floats your boat. But then it will just make matters harder for you if you have to confront Kitcher’s trio. Tell me, sir, have you decided to go with mythic self-consciousness, doctrinal entanglement, or doctrinal indefiniteness?  Don’t ask! Don’t tell!  That’s why many think the first spell should not be broken, but Kitcher and I have both ignored that admonition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher is at pains to express his defense of these delicate options sympathetically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll suggest that doctrinal indefiniteness can be a reasonable expression of epistemic modesty, and that even doctrinal entanglement can be justified when it is the only way of preserving, in the socio-cultural environment available, a reflectively stable orientation.  (p6) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;but a somewhat less diplomatic version hovers in the background: kid yourself if you have to. And, I am happy to say, Kitcher firmly draws the line at letting &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;of these options abrogate a commitment to reason when deciding ethical matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone who makes decisions affecting the lives of others is ethically required to rely on those propositions best supported by the evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a felicitous phrase he notes that “there ought to be no ‘teleological suspension of the ethical’,” but then just what is the &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; role of Abraham as a “knight of faith” supposed to be, when he so clearly violates this principle?  Kitcher says that Abraham’s “sort of trust is not legitimate”—you can’t put it much plainer than that—but how, then, does Kitcher find a way of endorsing Abraham’s (mythical) story as any sort of talisman for a meaningful life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher sketches a speculative account of the evolution of religious phenomena that is, as he says, an alternative to my own speculative conjecture—it sees the predominance of religion as explained by its being (socially) adaptive, not a byproduct of other evolutionary selection pressures—but he then draws a misleading contrast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; If you start with the thought that the predominance of religion in human societies is to be explained by a cognitive deficiency, you will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;tend [my italics] to see your campaign for the eradication of myths in terms of a return to intellectual health. . . . By contrast, if you suppose that the social factors towards which I have gestured have played a non-trivial role in the spread of the world’s religions, you will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;wonder&lt;/em&gt; [my italics] if there are psychological and social needs that the simple abandonment of religion will leave unfulfilled. (p9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be such a tendency, pulling in opposite directions, but Darwin long ago showed us that it should be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injurious substances should be utilized for [other] highly useful purposes. (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Various Contrivances by which Orchids. . . . 1862, p266—quoted in DDI, p461)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Kitcher’s wonder is just as available to me, and, similarly, however socially adaptive religious phenomena may have been in the past, their utility may have expired.  It is simply a mistake—but a very common one—to seek a theory of the evolution of religious phenomena that would provide some imagined warrant for your view of the value of religion today.  I worked hard to keep these issues distinct in my book, and Kitcher should acknowledge that his preferred speculation is logically independent of the main point for which he is arguing: that religion is valuable &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be. I find his most compelling point to be his observation that Dawkins and I should not extrapolate glibly from our own immense good fortune to find ourselves in a position not only to understand and appreciate the glories of the scientific world view but to have the thrill—no other word will suffice—of playing significant roles in the spreading of this vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . . the vast majority will never be able to recognize themselves as important participants in any impressive joint enterprise that contributes to knowledge and enlightenment. (p11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss this in &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Spell &lt;/em&gt;(pp286-92), where I note that religion has the unparalleled capacity to give people a chance to be, in Kitcher’s good phrase, &lt;em&gt;important participants&lt;/em&gt; in the world they were born into. But as I go on to discuss there, nobody has yet estimated what price we should be prepared to pay—in xenophobia, violence, the glorification of unreason, the spreading of patent falsehood—for that wonderful sense of importance religion gives to many people who would otherwise lead lives without drama, without a point.  Kitcher wants to preserve religions (at least for the foreseeable future, I gather) but I think it would be better to work constructively on secular institutions that can provide alternative structures of meaning for everyone.  Still, we might accomplish this most practically by encouraging existing religious institutions to evolve into . . . . &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; religions.  Some have already done so, but they are not yet competing very well in the marketplace of allegiances. Who knows what the near future will bring?  Religions have changed more in the last century than in the last millennium, and perhaps they will change more in the next decade than in that last century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitcher and I agree on so much.  We agree that “Public reason must the thoroughly secular” (p12)  We agree that the belief model of religion is indefensible. We agree that the first spell must be broken—we have both broken it.  We differ, apparently, only in our assessment of how to ease the people of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century into a more reasonable and socially benign form of orientation.  But even here, I think, we should both admit that we haven’t figured that out yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cricket story about &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2689"&gt;not having a word for "impossible"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;wasn't&lt;/b&gt; the last "no-word-for-X" story! Matthew Izzi, who writes from Boston, is a new reader of Language Log, and clearly a quick study, because he has already learned to be skeptical of things-people-have-no-words-for stories.  His antennae went up when he read the following photo caption (slide 4 of 5) on &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;'s "Book Bench" blog this morning:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pukapuka, also known as Danger Island, was, in the nineteen-twenties, a sanctuary for nudism, a place where "sex is a game, and jealousy has no place." There is no word for "virgin" in the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew writes in an email commenting on this suspicious claim about this little-known island of raunch: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000AA"&gt; This is presumably quoted from the newly published &lt;i&gt;Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Never Set Foot on and Never Will&lt;/i&gt; (Penguin, Oct. 5, 2010), by Judith Schalansky, a Berlin-based graphic designer and novelist. (Readers can draw their own conclusions about her research from the subtitle.)   A Google search for "&lt;tt&gt;no word for virgin&lt;/tt&gt;" turns up hits for Hebrew, Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Akkadian, Russian, "the Dutch," etc. Apparently, the meme has been used to argue, among other things, that (1) virginity was not prized by ancient cultures; (2) some cultures have difficulty comprehending the concept of the Virgin Mary; and (3) the Bible does not actually say Mary was a virgin. (The "no word for 'virgin' in Hebrew/Greek" claim against the legitimacy of the virgin birth of Christ appears to be a misunderstanding of an actual scholarly debate over the meaning of the Hebrew word "betulah," or "bethulah," in Isaiah 7:14-16.)   I did find one usage of the meme similar to the claim in Schalansky's book. An entry from An English-Nyanja Dictionary, by Robert Laws (1894), states on page 222: &lt;dir&gt; There is no word for 'virgin' in the Tshinyanja language. The word Tabiweta here given means an unmarried girl; but such is the state of morals among the heathen, that this does not imply that she is a virgin. Still, the word here given is the best that can be found at present to express it. &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male Language Log readers who dream of finding a place where there are ample supplies of hot babes who not not only do it but are unable to form the concept of not doing it — happily amoral victims of a lexical impoverishment that makes them powerless to avoid banging away like bunnies with every male Language Log reader who comes along — should clearly check out the island of Pukapuka — or alternatively Israel, Greece, Egypt, ancient Iraq (it might not be quite the same today), Russia, the Netherlands, or Malawi.  (Not California; there they have a word for &amp;quot;virgin&amp;quot;.)  Lots of luck, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, think about it: these traveler's tales about Pukapukan and Nyanja speakers are predicated on the idea that the lack of a word for "virgin" would imply, or be correlated with, a lack of any ability or willingness to limit sexual intercourse.  There seems to be no limit to how stupid the "no-word-for-X" stories can get.&lt;/p&gt;

Greg Easterbrook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, large-scale data collection by survey has been part of government in this country. Can surveys based on self-reported information ever be reliable, whether it's an 11th century peasant reporting how many ducks she has to a Norman or a 21st century woman giving personal information over the phone or online? Are such surveys inherently any more reliable and honest than the 'personality' quizzes in teenage magazines? Not least among the factors influencing responses are the way questions are framed and how the respondent thinks the information will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps a bit like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method"&gt;Montessori schools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.summerhillschool.co.uk/"&gt;A.S. Neill’s Summerhill School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But  then I discovered that they advocate &amp;quot;biodynamic farming&amp;quot;. That includes utterly barmy doctrines about how the phase of the moon affects crops and such like astrological baloney (as well as some possibly sensible stuff about compost). Then I had a series of mails from a correspondent that made me realise that Steiner schools have some much more unpleasant ideas than a bit of astrological baloney, including the dangerous ideas about &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761165/"&gt;anthroposophical medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/faceless%20dolls1.jpg" alt="faceless dolls" width="500" height="133"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Faceless dolls used in Steiner schools. &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/waldorfwatch/coming-undone"&gt;Waldorfwatch comments&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;In part, the goal is to stimulate children’s imaginations, which Anthroposophists believe contribute to clairvoyance. The deeper reason is the Anthroposophical belief that young children are incompletely incarnated in the physical world — they still live partially in the spiritual world, where nothing has sharply defined limits, edges, or details.&amp;quot;. &amp;quot; many children find faceless dolls creepy and unsatisfactory&amp;quot;. . .&amp;quot; Sometimes, indeed, the dolls come with pointed “elf” hats sewn on, suggesting that these are not human dolls by gnome dolls. Steiner taught that gnomes are real&amp;quot;, Picture from &lt;a href="http://www.sanderlingschool.org/html/about_us/miss_philo.html"&gt;Senderling Waldorf School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter has acquired new urgency now that Steiner schools are seeking government support via the Tory’s &amp;quot;free schools&amp;quot; programme. It is important that both ministers and parents should know what goes on in these schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to write about it for a while, but was deterred by the sheer amount of information.  My only contribution so far was to add Rudolf Steiner to my &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;Patients’ Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Anthroposophical medicine: followers of the mystic barmpot, Rudolf Steiner, for whom nothing whatsoever  seems to strain credulity&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Luckily I became acquainted with two of the most knowledgeable people on the topic. They are known on Twitter as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ThetisMercurio"&gt;@thetismercurio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Lovelyhorse_"&gt;@lovelyhorse_&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting them it occurred to me that I should ask them to write a guest post or two. Here is part one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The true nature of Steiner Waldorf education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a document  produced this September by the &lt;a href="http://newschoolsnetwork.org/assets/events/files/First_Steps_Guide_Sept10.pdf"&gt;New  Schools Network,&lt;/a&gt; the (avowedly) politically neutral  organisation set up to assist groups interested in Education   Minister Michael Gove’s  much vaunted and highly criticised Free Schools revolution, there is a  question:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;..what do you want  your school to be? A traditional school with a highly academic curriculum,  setting and streaming? Or a school following the Montessori method or  Steiner-Waldorf?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems  straightforward; in the case of Montessori it is so.  The two school systems are often linked as ‘progressive’ alternatives but  differ greatly. Montessori is a popular, predominantly  early years education method, represented amongst the first wave of 16 Free  Schools by the Discovery Free School, Crawley. Described as education adapted  for each individual child, in the UK Montessori places itself &lt;a href="http://www.montessori.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/50582/guide-to-early-years.pdf"&gt;within the remit&lt;/a&gt; of the  Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steiner Waldorf schools are similarly called &amp;quot;child-centred&amp;quot; but are in reality underpinned by a fantastical edifice of nonsense which directs the teachers in the way they work with individual children. The schools have  a distinct pedagogy in the context of which government guidelines are anathema; thus &lt;a href="http://www.savesteinerschools.org/?p=27"&gt;exemptions to the EYFS&lt;/a&gt; have been sought for the kindergartens at all Steiner settings. The &lt;a href="http://openeyecampaign.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;Open  Eye&lt;/a&gt; Campaign, championed by Steiner teacher Dr Richard House of Roehampton&lt;br&gt;
  University, stated in 2007 that they feared the EYFS was potentially harmful and ‘a breach of the human right of parents to have their children educated  in accordance with their own philosophies’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few early years  teachers reject the importance of play or would welcome an overly prescriptive  regime, many support the review of the EYFS currently being undertaken by Dame Clare Tickell.  But they may be surprised at the &lt;a href="http://www.greenworld.org.uk/page5/page107/page110/page110.html"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt; of Richard House and Graham Kennish,  Steiner teacher trainer and science advisor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Monoculture of  children’s minds. Strip mining of children’s imaginative forces for short-term  aims. The deep ploughing which destroys the soil and crushes individuality with  heavy machinery. The application of fertiliser which  turns childhood aspirations to dust which then blows away, leaving the  barrenness of violence in adolescence. …. Education as the cultivation of  inner resources for which an inner ecology is needed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anthroposophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this  histrionic language, parents and policy makers must understand the philosophy  that informs all Steiner   Waldorf schools (Waldorf in the US  and Europe): Anthroposophy. Wikipedia will not help here (it has been  ‘cleansed’), parents who ask are told the literal meaning: ‘wisdom of man’.  Anthroposophy’s inventor, Austrian Rudolf Steiner  (1861-1925) is presented by his proponents as a profound philosopher, a  polymath; an expert in agriculture and architecture, medicine, social care, art  and education. &lt;a href="http://www.goetheanum.org/1169.html?L=1"&gt;Triodos Bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.camphill.org.uk/about"&gt;Camphill Communities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://biodynamicshoax.wordpress.com/"&gt;biodynamic agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (including wine) and  the newly labelled &lt;a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/education/courses/basp/news-events/"&gt;‘Social Pedagogy’&lt;/a&gt; are all  expressions of Steiner’s anthroposophical ideas. The  first  ’Steiner’  school, named Waldorf after its cigarette factory patron, was opened in  Stuttgart in 1919. With typical bravado the Movement has for some time  proclaimed Waldorf ‘the fastest growing school system in the world’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying Anthroposophy  to his subject, Science Advisor Dr Graham Kennish  can be read some time before the Open Eye Campaign asking the &lt;a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:DxRh7QmEnjsJ:www.science.anth.org.uk/sgnl398.rtf+graham+kennish+science&amp;amp;cd=6&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;client=gmail"&gt;important questions&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How  valid is the current popular and medical perception of the heart as a pump?  What sustains this model and how much is lost in maintaining it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And in his: &lt;a href="http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/biologykennish.pdf"&gt;Teaching Biology in a  Human Context&lt;/a&gt;  he  describes Waldorf adolescents learning anatomy with a ‘sense of wholeness and  meaning’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennish was until  recently the Science advisor for the University of Plymouth Steiner BA course  (now closing) and is still featured on the University site as a researcher for  the &lt;a href="http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/researchcover/rcp.asp?page=322&amp;amp;pagetype=G"&gt;Steiner Waldorf  Academy Research Network, &lt;/a&gt;linked to the only UK  state funded Steiner Waldorf Academy, Hereford. Amongst the &lt;a href="http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/plymreadinglists/"&gt;set texts&lt;/a&gt; at  Plymouth (obtained through a recent FoI request) was a book called ‘Secrets of  the Skeleton, Form in Metamorphosis’, the jaw-dropping fantasy of which  presumably misled hosts of trainee Steiner Waldorf  teachers. But this isn’t science: it’s Steiner’s  ‘Spiritual Science’. As an advocate of this world view Dr Richard House &lt;a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6049290"&gt;made a plea&lt;/a&gt; in a  comment on the TES website for an understanding of the supersensible world through  Steiner’s ‘upgrading’ of science. But this is not,  he suggests, for the intellectually lazy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not mentioned  by the Steiner teachers taking your child into their  care is that Steiner was by the time he wrote and  lectured about education an occultist, an ex-theosophist whose insights were  gained, it is stated, through clairvoyance. Nor will they be honest about the core  beliefs of Anthroposophy, described by historian Dr Peter Staudenmaier: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Spiritual  advancement through karma and reincarnation, supplemented  by the access to esoteric knowledge available to a &lt;a href="http://www.goetheanum.org/791.html?&amp;amp;L=1"&gt;privileged few&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  influence of Anthroposophy on Steiner   Waldorf education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedagogy of  Waldorf schools is informed by Steiner’s esoteric  scheme of &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8615410/The-Education-of-the-Child-Dr-Rudolf-Steiner"&gt;karma and  reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;. The  child ‘incarnates’ in 7 year cycles: the ‘etheric’ body is born at 7, the  astral body at 14 and the ‘ego’ or the individuality that returns from past  lives, at 21. Abstract reasoning is discouraged too early (before 14) because  it interferes with the anthroposophical – spiritual – vision of human  development. If parents are surprised at this information, or believe it to be  a charming metaphor, we know that Steiner advised  his teachers to be coy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[W]e have to  remember that an institution like the Independent Waldorf School with its  anthroposophical character, has goals that, of course, coincide with anthroposophical  desires. At the moment, though, if that connection were made official, people  would break the Waldorf School’s neck.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Rudolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Steiner, Faculty  Meetings with Rudolf   Steiner (Anthroposophic Press,  1998) p. 115&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/GW3902.pdf"&gt;In this interview&lt;/a&gt; the late Joan Salter,  author of ‘The Incarnating Child’, (standard Waldorf &lt;a href="http://www.iaswece.org/waldorf_education/articles/faq.aspx"&gt;recommended reading&lt;/a&gt;), explains  the importance of her anthroposophical studies: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;JS: What appeals to  me about Steiner is that he is thoroughly practical.  We’re inclined to think of babies as children, but they have been old people.  Our “little treasures” have been here many times. I think we need to be aware  of this. You can see this if you observe the child. That is why I think  observation is so important.&lt;br&gt;
  LM: Can you say more  about this in relation to caring for young children?&lt;br&gt;
  JS: The reason we  come here again is to redeem old karma and to establish new karma. We need to  ask ourselves: If this is why the human being has come, how can we bring up the  child, or what can we do, to help the child do this?&lt;br&gt;
  LM: That sounds like  the key to parenting!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the &lt;a href="http://knol.google.com/k/anthroposophy-and-waldorf-education-the-kindergarten-years#"&gt;Steiner kindergarten  teacher&lt;/a&gt; is to facilitate the ‘incarnation’ of the spirits and  souls of children into their physical bodies. If there is here a philosophy  that the EYFS guidelines might “breach”: in our direct experience the significance  and implications of this philosophy are inadequately understood by most Steiner parents. Teachers, if pressed, may repeat that  ‘Anthroposophy is not taught to the children’ but this is disingenuous or  naive. The transmission of Anthroposophy is subtle, through verses, stories and  images. Every aspect of Steiner education is  informed by Steiner’s clairvoyant ‘insight’ or  ‘intuition’ and has occult implications. Thus the Waldorf categorisation of  children according to their &lt;a href="http://waldorfparents.blogspot.com/2010/09/children-and-four-temperaments-what.html"&gt;‘temperaments’&lt;/a&gt; and  their ’soul type’, school readiness linked to the ‘change of teeth’, the dance  form eurythmy, the oddly uniform artwork, the gnomes (or elementals) and the  faceless dolls, are all embodiments of the anthroposophical impulse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labeling  of children according to a spurious philosophy could be seen as insignificant  were it not for the pedagogical response of those Steiner teachers who, instead  of acknowledging a child’s real, individual emotions and behaviour, respond to  body-type, hair colour, gait and ‘humour’ in formulaic (occult) and potentially  detrimental ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/The_Four_Temperaments_Rudolf_Steiner.jpg" title="Click to enlarge"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/The_Four_Temperaments_Rudolf_Steiner-s.jpg" alt="Four temperaments" width="500" height="327"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene Schwartz, a Waldorf  Educational Consultant with his own US site Millennial Child, gave a series of  lectures called ‘The Karma of Education’ at Rudolf Steiner House, London in April this year at the invitation of St. Michael  Steiner School in Wandsworth. The &lt;a href="http://millennialchild.com/Resources/podcasts.html"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; is  available to download and is essential listening for Michael Gove.  Schwartz is candid and even entertaining; if anyone  could make Steiner’s Saturn/Sun/Moon evolution,  Lemuria and Atlantis palatable it might be him. But this is adult fantasy,  theosophical science-fiction; it is not a basis for the education of children,  however well-meaning or well connected some of its proponents may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Anthroposophy is an  esoteric movement with an ‘inner circle’, it is not surprising that the  undeclared hierarchy of Steiner schools includes practicing anthroposophists as  well as some teachers making attempts to work assiduously for the benefit of  their classes, trying even to ignore Anthroposophy. The turnover of the latter  type of teacher is high. For those who imagine they will ‘take the good bits  &amp;amp; ignore the rest’ of Steiner in any possible UK Free Schools, there are  indications &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=gmail&amp;amp;attid=0.1.1&amp;amp;thid=12926b8b51050098&amp;amp;mt=application/pdf&amp;amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Dc5e2a6f331%26view%3Datt%26th%3D12926b8b51050098%26attid%3D0.1.1%26disp%3Dattd%26zw&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbTRl1B694MMf5ilMor"&gt;in this document&lt;/a&gt; from the Association  of Waldorf Schools of North America, directed at the many ‘Waldorf inspired’  initiatives budding in the States, that without Anthroposophy there is no  Steiner Waldorf. Readers are instructed that essential to the &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; of teaching  is: &amp;quot;an openness to reckon with the unseen spiritual realities which live  behind the physical world and developing the perceptivity to experience what  this reality is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, those  concerned can buy a copy of the most recent (2007) edition of The Class  Teachers’ Handbook’ by Kevin Avison, available from the bookshop of the UK Steiner  Waldorf Schools Fellowship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;…without active  recall the teacher cannot claim to be including the spiritual world, the  activity of the night, in the lesson. Recall time is the moment in the lesson  when what is beginning to individualise itself in the child through their  unconscious communication with the hierarchies (especially the Angels,  Archangels and Archai – see for example, The Hierarchies as the Source of  Action Speech and Thought, April 28, 1023 – GA224) during sleep can express  itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same Handbook,  Avison advises teachers: &amp;quot;anything indicating what the class might have learnt  or covered in Morning Lesson should be ‘lost’ before you leave the school,&amp;quot; Many  have taken him seriously, since the ‘loss’ of notes is a complaint made  repeatedly by Waldorf parents all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  implications of spiritual science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are parents  asking for these schools? Steiner   Waldorf schools offer an  apparently creative, ‘unhurried’, authentic childhood experience free from our  dominant exam culture and from technology. They stress the ecological and  holistic. They are alluring. The distinct aesthetic within the Steiner  kindergarten: natural materials, wool, washed peach-coloured walls and gentle  voices creates for some parents a lost garden of childhood, in contrast to  which the brash plastic of the average nursery becomes an affront to the  senses. There’s no reason to suspect anything odd, so Michael Gove  can hardly be blamed for his positive reaction to the Bruton Steiner School, which  appears to have been his &lt;a href="http://beta.thisissomerset.co.uk/fosseway/news/Meadow-School-influences-new-policy-small-schools/article-1167375-detail/article.html"&gt;moment of zen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Steiner dream ends for many families with the realisation  that their child is academically far behind his or her peers. Susan Godsland,  an independent reading intervention expert, has helped many ex-Steiner children  learn to read at 8, 9 and 10. Though she acknowledges that some children can  blossom in Steiner school, that a percentage will  learn to read earlier in spite of the pedagogy, she believes it’s cruel to deny  a child the chance to read until so late. In the last paragraphs of her &lt;a href="http://www.dyslexics.org.uk/resources_and_further_20.htm"&gt;Room 101&lt;/a&gt; she  explains why early reading isn’t encouraged. A child is ‘blessed’ with not  being able to read and write, since Steiner says  early reading will hinder the later spiritual development of children. She  adds: ‘this is simply mumbo-jumbo and should be treated with the contempt it  deserves.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is evident  that this failure in basic teaching could cause low self esteem, the influence  of &lt;a href="http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/?s=doctors"&gt;anthroposophical  medicine&lt;/a&gt; within Waldorf schools is an added concern (for example, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761165/"&gt;mistletoe as a ‘treatment’ for cancer&lt;/a&gt;). In addition the &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18838"&gt;measles epidemics&lt;/a&gt; linked to  European Waldorf schools are an indication of an &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070906215310/http:/www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/measles.htm"&gt;anti-vaccination  culture&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18838"&gt;US Microbe Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Bernard Dixon  states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Steiner believed that febrile illnesses  such as measles and scarlet fever were related to a child’s spiritual development.  Adherents assert that the use of vaccines (especially measles vaccine) deprives  infants of the opportunity to benefit from the experience of having those  diseases.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Norway, homeopath Gro Lystad  enlists Steiner’s concept of a &lt;a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=no&amp;amp;u=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.7043347&amp;amp;ei=lFrAS4uBCIPw0wTHzYSnCQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=translate&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ7gEwAA&amp;amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DFrykter%2Butbrudd%2Bav%2Bmeslinger%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari"&gt;‘transforming  illness’&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am quite sure that  it is positive for a child who is healthy. It is conceivable that some will  die, but this applies to children who are impaired in advance,&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our opinion, &lt;a href="http://www.ecswe.net/downloads/statements/ecswe_vaccinationstatement.pdf"&gt;the disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; issued by  the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education regarding vaccination is not  entirely candid, since it states only that opposition to vaccination is not a  part of their “specific educational objectives”, omitting Steiner’s belief that  if children are vaccinated they will need a ‘&lt;a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ManfKarma/19100525p01.html"&gt;spiritual  education&lt;/a&gt;’. And it makes no mention of Karma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection of  evidence in favour of a ‘spiritual paradigm’ by adherents of Anthroposophy is  not surprising given that it is a belief system which is essentially  anti-scientific. Peter Staudenmaier, a historian who has written extensively  about Anthroposophy, &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/waldorf-critics/message/14631"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that:  ‘like other esotericists, anthroposophists regularly view themselves as privy  to special knowledge which distinguishes them from the unenlightened — and an  aggravated resentment against ‘intellectualism’ and critical thought and the  ostensibly materialist cast of modern science and scholarship.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These beliefs mean  that the emotional and physical health of children is potentially being put at  risk. We cannot agree that the satisfaction of lobbying groups or parent choice  is enough to justify the public funding of Steiner Waldorf  schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“went against my better judgment and let [insert daughter’s name] get a flu shot &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("&gt;  Result?…. Projectile vomiting in the back seat of our car. poor thing:( no more flu shots ever again!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very sorry to hear that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sorry to hear that. I was very sorry her little girl was sick and I was of course also very sorry that she had followed, not her better judgment but her preconceived bias towards vaccines that she had acquired primarily from watching Oprah and from shopping at &lt;em&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend had at long last found what she believed was a tangible reason to finally justify opting out of flu shots and most likely vaccines for good. Her child had vomited in the car on the way home after getting a flu shot. Therefore flu shots are bad. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of her friends posted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor baby! Poor mama! I use kids Immunity drops and elderberry drops as added immunity boosters during the first few weeks of school and after vacations back to school, and during big exposure periods. It seems to help with my kids. [enter kid’s name] just got the “back-to-school sniffles” but I feel like two days with lessened symptoms wasn’t bad while pumping him with his “medicine”. Live and learn, we’ve all been there. And you’ll hear the flipside from peeps who think you’re ‘endangering’ your child when you don’t give them things such as flu shots…always go with your gut!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This as you can imagine, pissed me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is literally nothing accurate about that women’s comment and her bullshit &lt;strong&gt;mommy-instinct crap is dangerous to the rest of us&lt;/strong&gt; and it’s specifically insulting to intelligent mothers everywhere. &lt;img src="http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/3702/answers.jpg" alt="I need answers" width="280" height="221"&gt;The message it sends is; &lt;strong&gt;Don’t listen when anyone tells you that you might be wrong about something&lt;/strong&gt; or you might be endangering the life of your child or the lives of the people around you. Hell no. Ignore that silly ‘flip side’ of any argument. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are always right. Just go with your gut! Don’t try to understand any difficult concepts. Nope, just go with your gut! In fact, just close your eyes and run through traffic. Your gut will tell you when a semi truck is headed your way. Intuition is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, ladies and gentlemen the general consensus seems to be that intellectualism and learnin’ is overrated. Us ‘peeps’ should only bother with natural, pretty, simple things that &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; intuitively right. We should just make babies and pies and pick daisies and think pure happy thoughts. &lt;img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/8134/allyouneed.jpg" alt="all you need" width="280" height="190"&gt;If it is difficult or confusing or contradictory to our commonly held beliefs or contrary to wishful thinking just don’t bother with it. Discard those thoughts. Mute those feelings. Medicine is bad unless it has a label that reads, “All natural” and is sold in an unregulated market at twice the price of actual medicine and fives times the price of actual berries. Books are a waste of time too, unless they have an Oprah sticker on ‘em or pictures for colorin’. Science is just an evil conspiracy too. Good mommies need only bother with science when they want their mini-van’s gps system to direct them to the nearest kundalini yoga class or when they want to be able to type uninformed, misleading tripe on facebook to share with the world so that they can inspire this next comment from a confused mother:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks for all the feedback. I was just on the fence about getting one [flu shot] for my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just great. One more woman scared into believing that vaccines and flu shots are bad with no legitimate evidence, just crappy, biased anecdotes from people who consider themselves qualified to give medical advice because they eat fruit and they squeezed a baby or two out their birth canal. Is it possible that the original poster whose child got sick in the car after the flu shot was carsick? Or had eaten something that made her sick? Or was sick before she got the shot? Or had a nervous mommy who stressed her out when she got the flu shot to begin with? Last time I checked you don’t swallow a flu shot so it shouldn’t make your stomach upset. &lt;strong&gt;Just because something happens directly after something does not mean that specific something caused it.&lt;/strong&gt; Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, directly after my TDaP booster shot I got an all expense-paid trip to London.&lt;img src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/97/vaccinequeen.jpg" alt="vaccine queen" width="280" height="210"&gt; And directly after my most recent flu shot, my sex life improved significantly! Why just last week at least five total strangers complimented me! I haven’t been sick one single time since my last vaccine. Not even the sniffles. I lost 2 pounds. I even moved into a better apartment. I got new shoes. I saw a double rainbow and a single rainbow. That’s like a triple rainbow! Wow! The world is just so much better now that I had a flu shot. Have vaccines and flu shots seriously improved my life that much? It would seem so! All those things happened after one another so they must be related. It’s all the proof I need. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that lady said that was ridiculous was the comment, “pumping him with medicine.” That is not an accurate description of what a vaccine is or does. A tiny shot is not a pump. A vaccine is not medicine.  A vaccine introduces a tiny often-dead amount of a virus so that the body’s immune system can identify and learn to battle that specific virus without you actually getting sick from it. The irony here is that when you get a vaccine it is actually stimulating your immune system so it is better at fighting off the actual disease should it encounter it. Huh, sorta like how the alternative medicine pushers and hippy moms imagine boosting your immune system &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also sick of the “oh it’s good for them to get sick” argument too. That is bull.  A fever often comes with a flu right? Is it ever a good idea to risk inducing brain damage to your child from a dangerously high fever or what about dehydration from vomiting? And I am just talking about regular run of the mil flu viruses here. I’m not even going to get into the details of the dangers of polio, whooping cough and other serious vaccine preventable illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is that wacky herd immunity you hear us talking about all the time. We need herd immunity to protect the people who &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; get vaccinated because they are too young or have compromised immune systems. Elderberry doesn’t do anything to solve this problem and you can’t boost your immune system. Let me repeat that. If you are healthy, &lt;strong&gt;YOU CAN’T BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;. That is a contrived statement created to sell alt med products that don’t actually do anything beyond creating a placebo effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advertising guy was sitting in an office somewhere trying to come up with a way to sell stuff that had no evidence of efficacy. He or she thought to himself or herself, what better tactic than to invent something that doesn’t exist and say that is what the ineffective product does. Like, oh I don’t know, boosting your immune system? Boosting your immune system is like enhancing your existence. See that, I just made that up. &lt;img src="http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/8132/existenceenhancing.jpg" alt="existence enhancing" width="280" height="280"&gt;Sounds good though right? Wouldn’t you like your existence enhanced? What? You already exist and my choco-berry pellets can’t &lt;em&gt;enhance&lt;/em&gt; your existence? Oh sure they can! Just ask my friend over here. Her existence is way better now that she spends an extra $50 a week so she can stick choco-berry pellets up her ass. Or you can be like me and just get an existence enhancing flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t bother to comment again on my friend’s facebook page even though a part of me really wanted to. I have learned when and with whom to pick my battles. Arguing on facebook with the alternative- hippy-anti-intellectual-mom crowd is completely useless if you are a child-free skeptic. The skeptic part isn’t even the worst part of it in their minds. It is the fact that I am child-free. I can never get my point across because they use the same circular, patronizing argument. “Well, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; just don’t understand. &lt;em&gt;You’re&lt;/em&gt; not a mother. If you were a mommy then you would &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what we are talking about. Mothers &lt;em&gt;just know&lt;/em&gt; what is best for their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, because having sex in the back seat of a 1982 Chysler Cordoba and giving birth in a blow up pool are acceptable alternatives to higher education.&lt;br&gt;

Quick everyone! Start handing out doctorates to all the mommies at Trader Joe’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I will be packing for my upcoming trips and I will be picking out some good non-Oprah endorsed books to read on the plane rides. BTW, I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend Stephen Hawking’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Design-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0739344269"&gt;new book, &lt;em&gt;The Grand Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;. I purchased it just after my last flu shot and I have really been enjoying it!&lt;/p&gt;

I've been meaning to write about it for a couple of weeks, but time kept getting away from me.

&lt;p&gt;What makes The Skeptologists a truly great show concept and a worthy bit of entertainment is firstly, the cast! Our cast is a world-class mix of knowledge, experience and talent from several different areas of expertise. Recently we’ve had to say goodbye to one of them. Dr. Phil Plait leaves the active cast of the Skeptologists to pursue his hosting role on &lt;em&gt;Bad Universe&lt;/em&gt; on the Discovery Channel.  We are so proud of his new opportunity, and I trust that everyone will greatly support his efforts with that new venture.  Dr. Plait has and continues to support our work on the show and of course, we’ll always consider him a very important member of the team, whether he appears on camera or not.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;img title="Dr. Pamela L. Gay" src="http://www.starstryder.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/HeadShot_PGay.jpg" alt="Dr. Gay joins the Cast of The Skeptologists" width="200" height="141"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gay joins the Cast of The Skeptologists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are sad to see Dr. Plait leave the on-camera cast, his departure has opened the door for a new member that we are very excited to announce: Dr. Pamela L. Gay will step in and fill Phil’s mighty big shoes as the resident astronomer and scientist with knowledge regarding all things spacey. You no doubt have heard about her successful podcast, AstronomyCast which she Co-Hosts with Fraser Cain. Her online website&lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com"&gt; StarStryder.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great source to find information about some of her many exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gay is a tremendous resource for our show she has already begun helping us out behind the scenes to get some new opportunities opened up for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very glad to have Dr. Gay on board and look forward to a rewarding relationship with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Katy&lt;/strong&gt; sent me this email the other day… it meant a lot to me and she was nice enough to give me permission to share it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks so much for coming to Mobile and giving a talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that made the biggest impact on me was when you were talking about outreach and that many people may have never &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt; met/talked to a non-Christian here in the South.  When I posted the picture I took with you after your talk, and said how great it was on my Facebook page, an old friend wrote me this timid message, “Are you an atheist?”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent her just a nice overview of the common myths, what I believed, and how it felt so good and liberating when I finally knew that it was okay to talk about my views without glossing them over.  You know the statements, “I’m not really religious, I’m spiritual.” &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote back and forth, and she told me that she’s been keeping her views secret all her life because she is surrounded by very religious family members who continuously pray for her, send her religious books, and subtly (or not so subtly!) pressure her.   She explained how she felt like a hypocrite.  She was frustrated and had to stifle herself when she heard that some of her friends “threaten their children with the devil and believe rainbows are signs that everything will be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave her some advice, shared some links (yours included), and told her a great first step would to be joining her local Freethinker meetup group… for crying out loud, her group had 750 members.  Well, the good news is that she has finally begun to gently broach the subject with her family, has been devouring articles and reading and posting things online, has joined some area foundations, and was just asked to be an official greeter for her local Freethinker group!  She has thanked me repeatedly, and I imagine now has begun to feel that uplifting, weight-off-your-shoulders sensation when you can finally be honest and PROUD of your views. It’s a process, and her journey has just begun, but she has jumped in feet first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really proud of her. It is true, like you said, we need to be outspoken, not angry, shouting, or cynical,  but just humble, real, willing, and honest.  She just wrote to me, “I love you, Katy, for who you are and for opening a whole Freethinking world to me!” So, thank YOU, Hemant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Katy L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Beach, Alabama
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s amazing and I can’t really take any credit. That’s all Katy.  But I think it does show how important it is to be out about your atheism.  Start small if you must — tell your close friends and trusted colleagues — but build from there.  Leave a Facebook status that questions religion. Start challenging your religious friends on the evidence for their faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there’s some truth to the idea that if you believe you’re the only person in your circle of friends who is an atheist… you’re probably not alone.  When someone else sees you coming out, they’ll be more inclined to follow suit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is such a high density of nerdery it may collapse to form a black hole. I have links to various marianesque chanteusery &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/08/08/get-marian-call-in-your-town/"&gt;in an earlier post about her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; The premiere of season 8 of MythBusters on The Discovery Channel! Woohoo! &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-scent-of-a-hyneman.html"&gt;The previews look great&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:00 p.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmmm, I know there’s something going on at this time… oh, &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. The premiere of Episode 2 of Bad Universe, &amp;quot;Alien Attack!&amp;quot; also on Discovery Channel! &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/05/more-bad-universe-episode-2-teasers/"&gt;I showed a teaser yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s another one. In this, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMEKG5tI4wE"&gt;I went spelunking in an underground cave in New Mexico to look for extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/vMEKG5tI4wE?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you catch the &amp;quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&amp;quot; reference? I have lots of stories about that cave, &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;which I’ll be live-tweeting tonight during the premier&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tune in and watch as I try to figure out if I, for one, am in imminent danger of having to welcome our new insect overlords. And don’t forget: there’s still a little bit of time left (if it’s before noon Mountain time, that is) &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/04/bad-universe-episode-2-swag-giveaway/"&gt;to win free swag from this episode&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

According to host Ira Flatow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at SciFri are facing severe financial difficulties, i.e.  raising money. NSF [National Science Foundation] has turned us down for  continuing funding, saying they love what we do, we are sorely needed,  but it’s not their job to fund us.  At the same time, NPR has said the  same thing, telling us that if we want to stay on the air, etc, we now  have to raise all our own money.

But in my opinion, Ackerman takes her assertions a little too far, in the process confusing multiple aspects of the immune response. While it’s probably true that certain immune responses worsen symptoms once a cold infection has been established, Ackerman also implies that a strong immune system does not help the body stave off infections in the first place.  And based on the scientific evidence I’ve been able to find, I don’t think that’s a fair conclusion.

The immune system is a machine made of many parts. When a virus attempts to invade the body, the innate immune response, a non-specific system that basically throws darts at the intruder, is the first thing that ramps up. If the virus nevertheless manages to set up shop, the adaptive immune response kicks in, which among other things produces the inflammatory molecules that cause cold symptoms as well as the antibodies that protect you against the same cold in the future. So the immune response that initially fights the invading virus isn’t the same one that kicks in once the infection has established its roots. It stands to reason, then, that while some aspects of immunity (particularly adaptive immunity) may well worsen symptoms, other aspects of immunity may not, and may in fact be very important in protecting against infection. Yet Ackerman writes:

In any case, the supplements, remedies and cereals that claim to strengthen immunity (and thereby protect you from colds) do no such thing. It would be one thing if by some magic they made your body produce antibodies to any particular virus. But they don’t. And though some of these products contain ingredients that have been shown in studies to affect elements of the immune system, there’s scant evidence that they bolster protection against infection by cold viruses. No one knows which immune agents — other than antibodies — accomplish that.

Ackerman argues that antibodies are the body’s only known defense against colds. This would be surprising, given that antibodies are but one tiny part of the immune response to most pathogens; it’s also not backed up by existing evidence. An antiviral protein known as viperin is now thought to play a role in fighting cold infection, for one: a 2008 study published in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine reported that when viperin activity is stifled during cold infections, the virus replicates more quickly. A 2004 study published in the Journal of Immunology suggests that a protein called human -defensin (HBD)-2 plays a role in host defense against the cold virus, too.

Granted, there is still much left to be learned about how viperin and human -defensin (HBD)-2 affect host protection, and they may not even be the most important players. But the point is, immune proteins other than antibodies do seem to help fight infection—they help to make you better, and perhaps even stave off infection from the getgo. So while Ackerman may be right that ramping up certain aspects of immunity with supplements and vitamins might make you feel more miserable once you have a cold, a robust immune system may not a bad thing when it comes to preventing and fighting the nasty bugs. If it were, then the best defense against a cold would be to stay up all night drinking and then attempt to run a marathon—because that’s a surefire way to pull the body’s resources away from immunity. I don’t know about you, but to me, that really doesn’t seem like a good idea.

Switzerland is not like most other countries, however, which is where a new study, from an international team lead by Merike Sisak at the Estonian-Swedish Mental Health and Suicidology Institute, comes in. They looked at data from a major new WHO initiative, SUPRE-MISS. The main objective of this study is to understand the factors that contribute to suicide in different countries, and what can be done to reduce them.

In each country, people who have attempted suicide are brought into the study and given a questionnaire to fill out. Another group of people, randomly chosen, are given the same questionnaire. That allows the team to compare religious affiliation, involvement in organised religion, and individual religiosity in suicide attempters and the general population.

When they looked at the data, and adjusted them for a host of factors known to affect suicide risk (age, gender, marital status, employment, and education), a complex picture emerged. 

In Iran, religion was highly protective, whether religion was measured  as the rate of mosque attendance or as whether the individual thought of themselves as a religious person.

In Brazil, going to religious services and personal religiosity were both highly protective. Bizarrely, however, religious affiliation was not. That might be because being Protestant was linked to greater risk, and Catholicism to lower risk. Put the two together, and it may balance out. 

In Estonia, suicides were lower in those who were affiliated to a religion, and those who said they were religious. They were also a bit lower in those who 

In India, there wasn&amp;#39;t much effect of religion at all - a bit lower in those who go to religious services at least occasionally.

Vietnam was similar. Those who went to religious services yearly were less likely to have attempted suicide, but no other measure of religion had any effect. 

In Sri Lanka, going to religious services had no protective effect, but subjective religiosity did.

In South Africa, those who go to Church were no less likely to attempt suicide. In fact, those who said they were religious were actually nearly three times more likely to attempt suicide, and those who were affiliated to a religion were an incredible six times more likely!

These are very large differences. In Brazil, religious people are six times less likely to commit suicide than the non religious. In South Africa, they are three times more likely. How to explain these national differences?

Part of it might be differences in the predominant religion. The protective effect of religion seems to be higher in monotheistic countries, and it&amp;#39;s particularly high in the most fervently monotheistic country, Iran. In India, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, the protective effect is smaller or non-existent.

But that doesn&amp;#39;t explain South Africa. South Africa is unusual in that it is a highly diverse country, fractured by ethnic, social and religious boundaries. The researchers think that this might be a factor:

South Africa has been described as ‘‘The Rainbow Nation’’ because of its cultural diversity. There are a variety of ethnic groups and a greater variety of cultures within each of these groups. While cultural diversity is seen as a national asset, the interaction of cultures results in the blurring of cultural norms and boundaries at the individual, family and cultural group levels. Subsequently, there is a large diversity of religious denominations and this does not seem favorable in terms of providing protection against attempted suicide.They point out that earlier studies have shown that religious homogeneity is linked to lower suicide rates, and they suggest that the reverse might well be happening in South Africa.

In fact, this also could explain why, in Brazil, Protestants have a higher suicide rate than the unaffiliated. That too could be linked to their status as a religious minority.

So once again we&amp;#39;ve got a study showing the double-edged nature of religion. For those inside the group, it provides support and comfort. But once fractures appear, religion just seems to turn up the heat!

And a recent study confirms our suspicions: though we are becoming more tech savvy, it may be at the expense of creative and critical thinking. Researchers from the University of Israel (2009), tested digital literacy with a group in 2002. In 2007, they tested this same group again and found statistically significant changes on the test scores.  Is this further proof of the widening double digital divide?

Digital literacy is defined in this study as the &amp;quot;ability to employ a wide range of cognitive and emotional skills in using digital technology&amp;quot; (713). This range covers six skills:Photovisual literacy: ability to work with digital environments that employ graphical communication, such as user interfaces.

Reproduction literacy: ability to create authentic, meaningful  written and artwork by reproducing and manipulating digital media.

Branding literacy: ability to construct knowledge by nonlinear navigation through knowledge domains (i.e., hyperlinks).

Information literacy: ability to consume information critically and sort out false and biased views.

Socioemotional literacy: ability to communicate in online communication platforms (e.g., chat, bulletin boards).

Real Time Thinking: ability to process and evaluate large amounts of information in real time, such as in computer games and chatrooms.

Participants were given tasks in four of these areas (photovisual, reproduction, branching, and information). When tested five years later, and compared to a control group, there was a significant change in digital skills.

The results demonstrate that all age groups in the study responded similarly: all were able to demonstrate an increased grasp of technology. However, on tasks that creativity and critical thinking (reproduction and information), the scores for younger participants dipped slightly in comparison to adults, whose scores increased.

With the ever increasing amount of information readily available via hyperlinks, and a growing willingness to use digital media to access that information, how can we encourage digital literacy and maintain critical thinking skills? How can we change students&amp;#39; relationships with information? And how can we ensure that everyone has access to the tools necessary to build a solid foundation of digital media?

Does the diminished critical thinking skill will add another level to the digital divide: those without access, those with access but with poor understanding of the tools, and those with access and understanding. What kinds of issues do you foresee these groups facing?

Personally, I love salty foods. While I have never been too fond of sweet things (chocolate, candy, etc.), just a few years ago I could have easily gone through a bag of chips or pretzels in one sitting. Just writing about that crunchy/salty goodness makes my mouth water.

However, since hypertension runs in my family, I have recently made a concerted effort to limit my sodium intake – largely by cutting out my intake or salty snacks. This process was made that much easier by living with a partner who is doing PhD research on the effects of salt intake on blood pressure, among other things. She got on my butt to limit my salt intake, while I got on hers to limit her intake of sugar – as diabetes runs in her family.

Regarding dietary sodium limits, it is suggested that adults stay under 1500 mg per day, and should never exceed the upper limit of 2300 mg/day. 

Unfortunately, as a population, the large majority of North Americans consume considerably more than the upper limit of sodium every single day (~80% of men and women). Given the well established effect of sodium intake on health (check this great resource for more info on salt and health) this collective hyper-salinity of our diet is contributing to high rates of cardiovascular problems.

So where’s the excessive salt coming from?

That’s where the recent study comes in.

In this trial, meals bought from 300 randomly selected chain restaurant locations in New York City during the weekday lunch hour between March 27 to June 8, 2007 were assessed for salt content. A meal was defined as any purchase with at least 1 entrée.

The main findings?

56% of meals purchased at fast food outlets contained more sodium than should be consumed during the entire day (&amp;gt;1500mg), with 20% of meals exceeding the uppermost limit for daily sodium intake (&amp;gt;2300mg)

Chicken fast food places tended to have the worst sodium levels per meal with 83.8% of meals exceeding the daily recommended level (1500mg)

Only 1 in 36 purchased meals met the Food and Drug Administration “healthy” sodium level for meals (600 mg)

The high sodium intake wasn’t necessarily driven by a high calorie intake, but rather by a high sodium per calorie ratio, with an average of 2136 mg sodium per 1000 calories purchased. Thus, even those eating lower calorie meals were likely to exceed their daily sodium limit within a single meal.

Take home message:

Stay the hell away from fast-food outlets!

And if you have absolutely no choice but to eat fast food (never the case), at the very least avoid fried chicken places such as KFC and Popeye’s.

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s  true that exhibits like this have the potential to unsettle those of  the faithful who are creationists or are on the fence.  The facts in  the Smithsonian exhibit are presented pretty uncompromisingly, and  that’s good.  What isn’t so good is that exhibits like this one often try to  defuse religious objections by presenting a particular theological view, to wit: human evolution is compatible with religion.  And of course I object  to that because it’s theology and not science. Why not just give folks  the science and let them draw their own conclusions? If they are  disturbed, they can go to their own pastor or any number of sources that  deal with science and faith.  I take &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/dragnet.asp"&gt;the Jack Webb approach&lt;/a&gt; to evolution exhibits: “All we want is the science, ma’am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with religious discomfort, the Smithsonian formed a “&lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/about/bsic"&gt;Broader Social Impact Committee&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/new-human-evolution-hall-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;Greg mentioned this committee last March&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s its mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  the vibrant scientific field of human evolution, new discoveries and   research findings are regularly reported as lead stories in newspapers   and other media. Despite strong public interest, however, many people   find the idea of human evolution troubling when viewed from a religious   perspective. While polarized public opinion on the matter is the usual   focus, the diversity of contemporary religious responses to evolution  is  less recognized. These responses point to opportunities for a   productive relationship between science and religion without assuming a   conflict between the scientific evidence of human evolution and   religious beliefs. . . The role of the BSIC is to offer support and advice regarding the public  presentation of the science of human origins in light of potential  responses by diverse faith communities to the subject of human  evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m not keen on this because it’s publicly-funded theology (the Smithsonian is run by the government): government endorsement of a no-conflict  model.  That would seem to violate the first amendment, since it favors one form of religion (those faiths that accept evolution) over others (those that are creationist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian committee comprised 13 people, eleven of whom are  identified by their religion: “Muslim,” “Judaism,” “Mennonite Brethren,”  and so on. There’s also a humanist—Fred Edwords—and a Dr. Joe Watkins,  who seems to represent only himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I didn’t detect excessive pandering to religion in the exhibit, but it was there nonetheless.  Here are some slides in an interactive computer display at the beginning of the exhibit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19879" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/evolution-exhibits-and-religion/p1000306-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="P1000306" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/p10003061.jpg?w=556&amp;amp;h=416" alt="" width="556" height="416"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;My answer to the question below: get rid of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19886" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/evolution-exhibits-and-religion/p1000307/"&gt;&lt;img title="P1000307" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/p1000307.jpg?w=557&amp;amp;h=417" alt="" width="557" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, which refers to different “stories” without noting that all save one are &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19889" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/evolution-exhibits-and-religion/p1000308-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="P1000308" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/p10003081.jpg?w=547&amp;amp;h=410" alt="" width="547" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this respect the Smithsonian exhibit is still far ahead of its rival: the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), whose &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/humanorigins/"&gt;Hall of Human Origins&lt;/a&gt; does even more distasteful pandering,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;No Right to Believe&lt;/em&gt;, Ezra Reznick publishes &lt;a href="http://norighttobelieve.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/an-open-letter-to-the-american-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;an open letter to the AMNH&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the accommodationism that infects the AMNH exhibit (which he otherwise liked):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the scientists on display (I have forgotten his name) asserts  that “science cannot tell us what is right or wrong, what is good or  evil, what is the meaning or purpose of existence. That’s what  philosophy is for; that’s what religion is for; that’s what moral and  ethical frameworks are for.” I found this statement to be incoherent and  misleading (at best). First of all, note that nearby displays in the  exhibit deal with the evolution of human art, tools, music and language —  and their analogs in other species — and we can likewise recognize  precursors of what we would call moral behavior, like cooperation and  compassion, in other social animals. Science certainly &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;have  much to say on the subject of morality — for instance, the theory of  evolution itself has had profound implications for how we treat nonhuman  animals (our cousins in the tree of life) and humans of different  races. In general, science can potentially tell us whether and how much a  given creature might suffer in a given situation — surely the primary  concern of morality. As for meaning and purpose, the theory of evolution  reinforces the understanding that there is no “cosmic purpose” behind  our existence; that the universe doesn’t care about us and wasn’t  created with humans in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, wouldn’t you know it, Francis Collins also appears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was further disappointed to see a video of Francis Collins, director  of the National Institutes of Health, proclaiming that while science is  the way to explore the natural world, he also believes in a personal  God, and finds science and faith to be complementary. To realize how  nonsensical and unscientific this statement is, replace the word “God”  with the name of a specific deity — Allah, Shiva, Zeus, etc. After all,  it’s not as if Collins is a deist or a generic theist (whatever that  might be) — he is an evangelical Christian,  and claims to believe many specific truth-claims of his doctrine: the  resurrection of Jesus, the divinity of the Bible, and so on. A Muslim or  Hindu scientist would hold different (often contradictory) beliefs. And  yet none of these religious dogmas are supported by any good evidence,  as is true for the belief that a personal God exists at all — indeed,  93% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences reject the belief  in such a God (according to a 1998 survey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as if the curators were worried that people would emerge from  the exhibit thinking, “Well, if we evolved naturally from nonhuman  animals, then our lives are meaningless and there’s no reason to behave  morally.” This is nonsense, but instead of highlighting how a scientific  understanding of the world (and the theory of evolution in particular)  can and should &lt;em&gt;strengthen &lt;/em&gt;our appreciation of life’s value and  our commitment to treating each other ethically, the exhibit chooses to  reinforce the tiresome tripe about how science can’t address the big  questions of life (while presumably religion can), and how we need to  rely on a supernatural deity to give our lives meaning and tell us how  we ought to behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins, along with other accommodationisms, also appeared on video at our Field Museum’s Darwin exhibit a while back, assuring distressed viewers that evolution and faith are perfectly compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top this all off, Alan Leshner, executive publisher of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; and CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, published a piece in last Saturday’s HuffPo:  “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-i-leshner/science-centers-museums-a_b_746864.html"&gt;How science museums are promoting civil religion-science dialogue.&lt;/a&gt;” He explains how the Smithsonian’s outreach committee affected the exhibit. There was some sensitivity training for volunteers, which is great—we don’t want docents insulting people who come to learn about human evolution.  But there were two warning flags.  Leshner notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to counter the dangerous polarization within our society  related to science-religion issues, as demonstrated by the Smithsonian’s  David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins. A key to the exhibit’s success,  Potts says, was the decision to center the exhibit around a question  rather than an answer: “What does it mean to be human?” (Similarly, The  Exploratorium in San Francisco presents information about human origins by asking, “How do we know what we know?”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they counter the “dangerous polarization” by pretending that the exhibit is not about answers (which, of course, it is), and by allowing viewers to construct their own answers. This is something Greg worried about in his post below, but I didn’t realize it was part of a deliberate strategy to defuse religious conflict.)  And the impact committee had another effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these and other tactics have allowed the museum to move “beyond  the stereotype that scientists only believe one thing and people with  strong religious views can only believe another,” Potts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they do this by pretending that there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; scientists who reject religion, and that science and faith are always friends. That’s intellectual dishonesty, and even if it’s in the service of promoting evolution, I reject it. Far better to leave out all mention of faith.  Let the faithful see the facts, and ponder their discomfort on their own time.  It’s not the job of public exhibits, particularly government sponsored ones, to take a specific position on theology.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's what Ira Flatow says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at SciFri are facing severe financial difficulties, i.e. raising money. NSF [National Science Foundation] has turned us down for continuing funding, saying they love what we do, we are sorely needed, but it's not their job to fund us. At the same time, NPR has said the same thing, telling us that if we want to stay on the air, etc, we now have to raise all our own money. Despite what listeners may think, NPR only gives us about 10 percent of our funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, man. This month I'm hitting you up to contribute to &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=70157&amp;amp;category=197&amp;amp;max=50"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt;, and now I have to suggest that you might also &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/about/sponsor/"&gt;donate to Science Friday&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;It's always helpful when the ninnies declare themselves like that. Although, it's also true that he declares himself a Republican, which nowadays is also grounds for voting against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I also take exception to the newspaper article. This is not right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My knowledge and my faith leads me to believe in both evolution and creationism," he said. "I believe God created the earth, and it evolved."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Creationism generally teaches that the Bible is historically and scientifically accurate, and the earth is less than 10,000 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many flavors of creationism, and they don&amp;#39;t all teach that the earth is that young; this young earth nonsense has only relatively recently (since the 1960s) come to dominate the discussion. All this kind of misinformation does is give the guilty ones an out — Brady is probably an old earth creationist from the quotes I read, and now he can protest that he &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; a creationist, as defined by the Chicago Sun Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/illinois_governor_race_simplif.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ifXLV8gGp_4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286383047536"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/dammit_wheres_my_thimerosal.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49e9c655b2a37e57</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Dammit!

It's the least I can do to protect myself and to protect the immunosuppressed patients around me in a major cancer center. I was looking forward to cheekily asking the nurse administering the vaccine to make sure mine had thimerosal, but when I got to the part of the clinic where the flu vaccines were being administered I was in for a nasty surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first indication came when I had to fill out a form &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/if_im_not_here_tomorrow_youll_know_why.php"&gt;similar to last year's form&lt;/a&gt; asking me if I had ever had a reaction to egg products or the seasonal influenza vaccine before. I say "similar" because the form was not the same. There was something missing. Last year, I distinctly remember being asked if I had ever had a reaction to thimerosal or mercury and seeing a notice that the flu vaccine I was about to receive contained thimerosal. This year, the question was conspicuously accident, and I began to wonder why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/dammit_wheres_my_thimerosal.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/dammit_wheres_my_thimerosal.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/UMIWw7uL5e4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286381660116"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29491">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c54ed80048131538</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Want to Win An Election?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How should constituents interpret statements by politicians who see their campaigns and causes as part of God’s plan? How do you decipher God’s intentions for you?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of my response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… we live in a society where too many people vote based on which fictional deity a candidate believes in and not the positions that candidate takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who vote for candidates because they’re swayed by their faith are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates who exploit their faith in an attempt to get votes are not the type of people we ought to elect to public office. We live in a secular democracy, and we’re better off because of it. When religion gets thrown into the mix, it’s bad for politics and worse for faith.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, everything, even including mosquitoes, ticks, catholic priests and candirú -- those crazy Amazonian fish that swim into human penises and using their backward-facing spines, embed themselves into one&amp;#39;s bladder. What sort of perverse supreme being would create such horrible creatures, anyway?But unlike kooks and wackaloons, who have an idiosyncratic sense of reality anyway, scientists rely upon solid, testable evidence to support their claims. To that end, proponents of &amp;quot;intelligent design&amp;quot; -- the modern incarnation of creationism -- have co-opted the use of words that sound scientific, hoping to deceive the public into accepting their beliefs as valid. For example, comparing proteins to intracellular &amp;quot;machines,&amp;quot; IDists argue that there are so many complex molecular &amp;quot;machines&amp;quot; in cells that it boggles the mind to think they could have evolved de novo so many times. But did they?&amp;quot;[T]he fact is that most of these &amp;#39;machines&amp;#39; are related to many other such &amp;#39;machines&amp;#39; in the cell, and they are subtle variants on each other,&amp;quot; said molecular archaeologist Joseph Thornton. Dr Thornton is an associate professor in the Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oregon in Eugene and an early career scientist for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. &amp;quot;The complexity only had to evolve once, after which it was subtly altered by tinkering,&amp;quot; said Dr Thornton. &amp;quot;But unless you really look under the hood of these proteins, the common template is obscured, and it appears that their complex functions had to evolve de novo in each one.&amp;quot;Dr Thornton spearheaded an international team of researchers who &amp;quot;looked under the hood&amp;quot; at the template for a large and important family of proteins, the nuclear receptors (NRs). There are hundreds of different NRs and they regulate essential biological processes, such as development, metabolism and reproduction. They accomplish this by triggering the expression of specific genes in response to hormones, nutrients and other chemical signals.  Many NRs are activated after binding to a specific hormone or other small molecule, known as a ligand, before they can bind DNA. However, some NRs function without the influence of a specific ligand, while others are incapable of activating gene expression, instead acting primarily as repressors by stopping the expression of particular genes. But which type of NR evolved first? The prevailing hypothesis is that the ancestral NR caused changes in the cell without having to bind a particular ligand first, suggesting that complexity -- the capacity to be regulated by chemical signals -- evolved independently in many lineages. But an alternative hypothesis suggests that the ancestral NR was a ligand-activated protein. This hypothesis, which has received scant attention, implies that minor evolutionary tinkering with the conserved ancestral type allowed NRs to respond to new molecular partners or, alternatively, to lose dependence on those partners after mutations that modified or degraded existing functions.To understand how the functional activity of NRs evolved, Dr Thornton&amp;#39;s team searched GenBank and identified the DNA sequences, functions, and molecular structures of hundreds of NRs. Comparing these data, they used computers to extrapolate and reconstruct the biochemical characteristics of the ancestral NR, which first arose in the mists of time -- as long as a billion years ago, before all the different animal lineages evolved (figure):Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, the team&amp;#39;s computer analysis showed that the ancestral NR did require activation by a ligand. They also found that the underlying molecular mechanisms that allowed the ancestral protein to be activated by chemical signals were conserved in virtually all present-day NR descendants.The likely ancestor to all NRs arose before the earliest animal lineages, giving rise to two NRs in demosponges (see figure, above and also refer to photograph at top). Demosponges are simple, multicellular animals in the phylum porifera, which is the most basal of the animal groups and thus, is closest to the ancestral animal. The team tested the activity of the two demosponge NRs and found that they are activated by fatty acids, suggesting that the ancestral NR&amp;#39;s ligand was probably also a fatty acid. Fatty acids are produced when fats are metabolised or broken down by the body. The researchers tinkered with the sponge NRs by making small changes that they predicted had followed the evolutionary changes to NR activity. They tested their predictions for how particular changes in the amino acids located in the ligand-binding pocket could change their mutant NR&amp;#39;s binding character and function. As predicted, they found that some of their mutant NRs evolved partnerships with different hormones or other chemical signals after just a few changes that subtly affected the size and shape of the cavity where the signalling molecule binds. Other mutations made the NR structure more stable, removing the need for the protein to interact with a chemical signal before activating gene expression. These ligand-independent NRs are constitutive gene expression activators, like a light switch stuck in the &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; position. &amp;quot;Each body plan seems to be its own unrelated form, and how it might be possible to transform one form to another is mind-boggling,&amp;quot; said Dr Thornton in an email message. &amp;quot;[But] when one identifies the underlying mechanisms for building these forms and reconstructs evolution vertically, tracing it through time from common ancestors, [then] the process of evolutionary transformation from a shared ancestral template becomes clear,&amp;quot; said Dr Thornton. This idea also forms the core for research in developmental evolution, more commonly known as &amp;quot;evo-devo&amp;quot;: the morphology of animals -- from jellyfish to fly to worm to fish to human -- are built using the same basic genetic toolkit, subtly reorganised and redeployed to build the wing of a fly or the limb of a human. &amp;quot;This is the protein version of this concept,&amp;quot; explained Dr Thornton. &amp;quot;There is little true novelty in evolution, but remarkable creativity through the tinkering processes of mutation, selection and drift.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I find this issue interesting whether or not it&amp;#39;s related to the controversy over intelligent design,&amp;quot; added Dr Thornton. &amp;quot;It is about the nature of evolutionary creativity and the difficulty of seeing our own connections to our past.&amp;quot; Sources:Bridgham, J., Eick, G., Larroux, C., Deshpande, K., Harms, M., Gauthier, M., Ortlund, E., Degnan, B., &amp;amp; Thornton, J.

&lt;p&gt;But it is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to image a world in which our collective respect for the National Science Foundation, who is pulling their funding for the program, is seriously compromised.  Also, it is easy to imagine a world in which we do NOT renew our memberships to NPR because they are ALSO pulling funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ira Flatow, host of Science Friday, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/major_funding_for_science_frid.php#c2841113"&gt;has added a comment below which you should read.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, I tend to be  bit radical in these areas.  I may very well shift my personal donation to Sci Fri despite Ira's suggestion, or perhaps split the donation between the two, for a year, in order to make the point.  Also, as soon as I can find out to whom a letter should be addressed at NSF I'll let you know.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since NSF funding is set by the congress, a letter to your members of congress would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And the only thing holding you back is the unpleasant task afterward of having to scrub your boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;i&gt;actual article&lt;/i&gt; from USA Today's "Faith and Reason" section, which doesn't seem to have much reason behind it. It's by Cathy Lynn Grossman, who claims to love talking about "visions and values, faith and ethics", and yet, manages to provide the most nauseating commentary on the recent Nobel for in vitro fertilization yet, even worse than anything I've seen from the Catholics. &lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/10/ivf-nobel-prize-test-tube-babies/1"&gt;Consider these repugnant questions from Ms Grossman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think a baby conceived in test tube is still a child in the eyes -- or mind or hands, depending on your theology/philosophy -- of God? Does the science behind this merit the Nobel Prize for Medicine or condemnation in the realm of faith and ethics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think a baby conceived in test tube is still a child in the eyes of God? Does the science behind this merit a Nobel Prize, or ethical condemnation? And what about the parents? Is their IVF choice selfish or loving? Are they creators -- or merely shoppers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I read the whole column. There&amp;#39;s not much there. I was looking for some indication that these were rhetorical questions that would be quickly dismissed, but there&amp;#39;s nothing…there&amp;#39;s a quote from the bioethicist Arthur Caplan about the impact of IVF, and there&amp;#39;s a bunch of standard Catholic nonsense deploring the commodification of embryos, but Grossman just raises this vile and ignorant question without a single remark about the obvious fact that the 4 million people who are here because of IVF are…people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are these children? Soulless zombies? Or are they just damned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title alone is remarkably off. "'Test tube babies': God's work or human error?": those are our choices? These kids are &lt;i&gt;mistakes&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it disturbing that some people consider the circumstances of a child&amp;#39;s conception to be serious grounds for contemplating their status as members of the human race. This is where magical thinking about undetectable spiritual entities leads you — to a different kind of dualism, where I am privileged because I&amp;#39;ve imagined that I&amp;#39;m granted a soul, while you are lesser because I&amp;#39;ve imagined that you have not…and by the way, you have no means to challenge my claims, which are entirely ethereal and supernatural and also accepted by the majority of the law makers and enforcers in my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's incredibly offensive to go further and suggest that the parents of these children, who have gone to extraordinary expense and trouble to conceive, are mere "shoppers", as if people who get pregnant in a casual evening's rut are somehow necessarily conscientious ethical philosophers and serious about their children, while someone who sinks $10,000+ dollars into invasive medical procedures and subjects their body to a few months of stressful hormonal treatments must be getting pregnant on impulse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really are stupid questions. Grossman just asked a few, and is entirely oblivious to what they imply about her and her attitudes towards children born by methods of which she disapproves. What next? Shall we consider ostracizing a few bastards, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously posted about this title after the &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727735.600-stop-wasting-food-save-the-worlds-energy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; on food waste I co-wrote with Michael Webber sparked a good deal of interest around the web. (&lt;em&gt;Food waste accounts for a whopping 2 percent of annual energy consumption in the U.S.!&lt;/em&gt;).  Naturally I’ve been curious to read Bloom’s perspective considering he’s been pondering the problem since 2005:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Tom Vanderbilt did for traffic and Brian Wansink did for mindless  eating, Jonathan Bloom does for food waste. The topic couldn’t be  timelier: As more people are going hungry while simultaneously more  people are morbidly obese, &lt;em&gt;American Wasteland&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the  history, culture, and mindset of waste while exploring the parallel  eco-friendly and sustainable-food movements. As the era of unprecedented  prosperity comes to an end, it’s time to reexamine our culture of  excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at both a local grocery store and a major fast food  chain and volunteering with a food recovery group, Bloom also interviews  experts—from Brian Wansink to Alice Waters to Nobel Prize–winning  economist Amartya Sen—and digs up not only why and how we waste, but,  more importantly, what we can do to change our ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;em&gt;American Wasteland&lt;/em&gt; is packed with a lot of startling information compiled an an easy to digest package. Bloom presents the topic in an engaging style and tackles related issues from many angles by looking at each step in the process from industry to consumer.  Ultimately he provides real world solutions that might just work to waste less and distribute more–if we makes some big changes.&lt;/p&gt;

They set up the « c factor », for collective intelligence, somehow a parallel of the g (for general intelligence. I told a bit about this after Prof. Haier’s conference at the EMBO meeting). In brief, what the authors report, is that individual intelligence of people constituting a group (a team) is not correlated with the success of the team to solve a problem. Further, when extending the tests, it came up that having more women in the team increases the so called « social sensitivity » and improves performance.

Not even a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. Otherwise, there would be no need for that scene at the end of The Empire Strikes Back showing Luke getting a spiffy new cyborg hand.

What humans need med droids for, amphibians accomplish with ease. Adults can regrow entire limbs. Tadpoles, well, they don’t have limbs yet, but they can regrow their tails. A tail is a complex organ, with nerves, muscle, blood vessels, and the like, so it’s not like regrowing a patch of skin or something. And they can do all this in about a week.

Unless that tadpole is exposed to a little spritz of MS222.

MS222 means no new tail.

I’d heard about MS222 before. It’s often used as an anesthetic for fish, and I’d seen it mentioned from time to time as an anesthetic for crustaceans. I didn’t know how it worked, but I learned from a new paper from Tseng and colleagues that MS222 turns out to block voltage-gated sodium channels.

When I learned that, I thought, “A-ha! So that explains why it’s an anesthetic! Because voltage-gated sodium channels initiate action potentials! If you block them, your neurons stop working: they can’t spike.”

But then I thought, “Wait, what? Why should that make a difference in tail regeneration?”

It’s not obvious. Apparently, Tseng and colleagues found this out by screening a lot of chemicals on African clawed frog tadpoles (Xenopus laevis), not because they were specifically testing for anything related to sodium channels. And the dose they were using was so low that it wasn’t acting as an anesthetic or paralytic, so it wasn’t that MS222 was stopping regeneration by knocking the animal out.

From there, the team did a series of experiments aimed at tracking down which kind of sodium channel was involved in regeneration (there are several, slightly different ones). Then, they knocking out the channel with RNA interference, and showed that also blocked tail regeneration.

But it be cooler if we can take a tail that couldn’t regenerate, and make it grow back?

Oh yeah. We can.

Tadpoles can’t regrow their tails when they’re about a month and a half old. The  sodium channels aren’t in the tail then. The research team added in a few new sodium channels: through the wonders of genetic manipulation, they added in a gene that’s normally found in mammalian hearts, and voila! Tails are regrowing. They tried another trick to get sodium inside the cells, and that also improved regeneration.

This is obviously exciting stuff. It suggests a whole new way to try to get at regenerating tissues. The authors say that many of the relevant pathways in tadpole regeneration are also present in mammals, although obviously the similarities aren’t perfect. Otherwise, Skywalker wouldn’t need that cyborg hand. Still, this has exciting potential for medical treatment.

I still don’t know why this got published in The Journal of Neuroscience, though. This isn’t a neuroscience paper. It just isn’t. That the ion channels involved are also present in neurons is probably the ostensible reason. But by that logic, you could just as well argue for publishing it in a muscle journal, since there’s muscle in the tail.

Among the many e-mails we received was one asking what steps I take to improve the science education of my own daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the education system, while necessary, is difficult and even in the best case scenario will take time. Many parents want to know what they can do in the meantime to increase the odds that their children will grow to be not only scientifically literate, but passionate life-long learners of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have anything to offer except my own personal musings and experience. Much of what I do is fairly obvious, but if nothing else it may inspire some parents to take a more active role. There is compelling evidence that parental involvement is a critical component of a child’s education, science or otherwise. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) &lt;a href="http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/parents.aspx"&gt;has a list of some references&lt;/a&gt;, along with some practical advice of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two daughters, in the 6th and 2nd grade in public school. This is what I have done to help with their science education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach by Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most important things is just to share your love of science. I am always looking for opportunities to show my daughters how cool something is. I share my own interest in science with them – for example by putting on science documentaries and then watching along with them, throwing out some enthusiastic comments and being there to answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to always reward questions with praise – often their questions are very probing and insightful (even when they may be factually naive) and I make a point to tell them so. I often reflect questions back at them and give them a first crack at answering it, and then we explore the question together rather than just giving them an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a risk in my daughters seeing me as an authority figure that should not be questioned. Children tend to do this with all adults, but especially those with specialized knowledge that can seem overwhelming. So above all I try to make the process of asking questions and understanding the natural world seem as accessible as possible, something that we can do together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage them to develop some expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a great experience for a child to develop an area of knowledge all their own. Find something that interests them and gently encourage them to pursue it. My older daughter became interested in birds at a young age, so I made that a family hobby. We now have multiple feeders and bird houses in our back yard, and at least a dozen volumes of bird reference books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this I knew next to nothing myself, so this was an area we could develop together. From early on she understood that she could know as much as I do about the topic – and before long her knowledge exceeded my own. From this she learned the pleasure that comes from knowledge. Her appreciation for birds was enhanced by her ability to observe small details, and understand the basics of categorization. Eventually she started asking why certain birds had certain features, and that led to discussions of evolution and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From any narrow science topic, many basic science lessons and skills can be derived. So it doesn’t really matter if your child takes an interest in birds, or dinosaurs, any animal group, shells, minerals, flowers or other plants, the planets, or whatever. The point is, while you want to give them a breadth of knowledge, it is also good to teach them the joys and advantages of having great depth of knowledge in one area – whatever that area is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage with their school work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty harsh in my assessment of the quality of science education in the public schools. Much of the feedback I have had from recent discussions affirms my criticism (while there is much disagreement as to cause). I heard from many science teachers who complain that they do not have enough time and resources, and most complained that the new requirements to teach for standardized testing robs teaching time away from science. High School teachers complain that kids are coming to them lacking in some basic math and science skills, so they are hampered by having to make up for these deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own experience through my children has been hit and miss – some science teachers are better than others. There does seem to be a trend toward better quality in the older grades, where science teachers are more likely to have special training in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless, I make it a point to follow closely what my daughters are learning in their science class. What I mostly do is simply ask them what they learned, or have them describe to me what projects or lessons they are engaged in. Of course, whenever they bring a project home I can more directly assess what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I ask them some basic questions to assess what they learned from the lesson or project. What I frequently find is that they have memorized (to varying degrees) the pat answer they were supposed to learn, but when I probe further to see if they really understood the fundamental lesson, I often get blank stares. What they learned, if anything, was fairly superficial and they of they often were not given an appreciation for the real lesson (as best as I can tell – sometimes it is not obvious to me, or my daughters, what they were supposed to learn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way I can help them get the most out of the lessons they do have, reinforcing experimental methods, the nature of hypotheses and theories, why what they are learning is important and how it is useful in the real world, and often adding the “coolness factor” of what they are learning. I may also flesh out the relevant facts as well, but that is probably the least important component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short I try to make their school lessons into what they should have been in the first place.  But also I have the luxury of individualizing their teaching in a way that is not practical in a classroom. So I can take them further on a topic if they are interested – to exactly as far as they are currently capable of going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also no reason to wait for a topic or project to come up in school. There are fun things you can do on your own. Science museums, aquariums, zoos, and nature preserves are, of course, great family activities and opportunities to squeeze in some science education. Even a visit to the beach is loaded with opportunities.  But there are also things you can to right at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night sky is nature’s planetarium. Get a telescope (there are cheap but useful ones available). Seeing the moon through a telescope is easy and an experience your kids will remember. Of course, the more ambitious you are, the more there is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naked-eye astronomy is fun also. The constellations can teach them about the seasons, the basic mechanics of the solar system, and the nature of suns and stars. Planets are fun to identify and follow. There are also the occasional lunar eclipses and meteor showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live near a park or with access to woods or rural areas, there is a ton to explore. It is also easy to make a simple walk through the woods into a fun game that will really engage your kids. Just calling a walk through the woods an “exploration adventure” was enough to get my girls all excited. Then we can see how many different kinds of leaves we can find, or find out what lives under rotting logs, or look for signs that animals have been through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these kinds of activities I try to make sure first that they are fun and casual. I am careful not to overwhelm my kids with information or make it seem like school or like work. First and foremost it’s fun and entertaining. I also think that it’s best to think of 1 or 2 take-away lessons you want them to learn from each experience. If you give them too much information they may forget everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when viewing the stars I might talk to them about the fact that every star is a sun, similar to our own sun, but they are just really far away. Then reinforce this point several times, asking how far away they think the stars have to be in order to seem like just a point of light. Then I reinforce that point again the next day in casual conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, at this stage I would rather they really learn and own one fundamental concept then give them a bunch of facts they are going to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is fun, useful, and empowering, and the universe is a really cool place. If you believe that yourself, all you need do is share that experience with your kids. Hopefully I have provided some ideas and things to think about to maximize their interest in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important than any facts or concepts you may teach them, is making them into lifelong self-learners in science. Then, it really doesn’t matter as much if their grade school science education is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286370417563"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=21922">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b70c518464fad0ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Cassini"/><category term="optical illusion"/><category term="Saturn"/><title type="html">Saturn brain bender</title><published>2010-10-06T13:00:02Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T13:00:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/uk9m2vPTXcw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/06/saturn-brain-bender/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually, pictures of Saturn aren’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard to figure out. Planet, rings, moons, and so on. But then &lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6542/Light_and_Dark_Tricks"&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; showed up, and I had a real &lt;em&gt;What the frak?&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/06/saturn-brain-bender/#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; moment: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ciclops_ir_2010/6542_15750_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/cassini_saturn_brainbender.jpg" alt="cassini_saturn_brainbender" title="cassini_saturn_brainbender" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, it took me a few seconds of disorientation before suddenly the picture geometry snapped into my brain. It was like one of those optical illusions where once you see it, you can’t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; see it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on here? Actually, a &lt;em&gt;lot!&lt;/em&gt; So strap yourself in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Cassini was behind Saturn when it took this picture; the sun, Saturn, and Cassini were almost exactly all on a straight line (for pedants, the Sun-Saturn-Cassini angle was 178°). From Cassini’s point of view, Saturn was almost completely unilluminated by the Sun. In others words it was over the night side of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun is shining down on the rings a bit, and Cassini is viewing them from underneath. Off to the right, you’re seeing the rings with sunlight scattering through them. The dark triangle is Saturn’s shadow on the rings. The curved line of the triangle on the left is the limb of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s with the rings on the left? Is that the shadow of them on Saturn? Nope, it can’t be, because the Sun wasn’t lighting them up. So those must be the rings themselves in silhouette! The lit-up part of the rings on the right reflect light onto the dark side of Saturn, illuminating it a little bit. That’s why you can see the disk of the planet at all. But the rings go all the way around, and on the upper left, they block that small amount of light coming from the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, fine, then what’s that weird faint glow on the planet then just below the silhouetted rings? Ah, that’s light scattered from Saturn’s own atmosphere! After the Sun sets on Earth, the sky is still lit up a bit, right? It’s only when the Sun is well and truly set, about 90 minutes later, that it gets completely dark. That’s because sunlight hits the Earth’s air and bounces around, letting it light up the air a bit on the dark side of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing here on Saturn: that glow is a little bit of sunlight that got scattered by air closer to the lit side of the planet, and it gives the dark side a taste of light. I guess you could say that if you were floating in Saturn’s atmosphere, at that point, it would be twilight for you. And if you looked up, you’d see the magnificent rings coming across the sky, then suddenly cut off by Saturn’s shadow. What a sight that would be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still having a hard time? This may help. Remember &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/12/27/the-top-ten-astronomy-images-of-2006/"&gt;this glorious picture of Saturn from 2006&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/saturn_backlit_sm.jpg" alt="saturn_backlit_sm" title="saturn_backlit_sm" width="610" height="253"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mosaic of quite a few images, stitched together to produce this magnificent portrait. The Sun is behind the disk of Saturn, and you can see the rings lit up on the sides, but in silhouette against the disk itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine the shadow of Saturn is cutting off a piece of the rings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/saturn_backlit3.jpg" alt="saturn_backlit3" title="saturn_backlit3" width="610" height="253"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Photoshopped in the shadow (I know, the angle is all wrong, but this is supposed to be illustrative, not perfect), and then put a red box around the region showing, more or less, where the new image is (I also flipped the original full-Saturn image around so that it better matches the new image). Now do you get it? We see the lit rings on the right, the shadow of Saturn across the middle, and the silhouetted rings against the disk of the planet! Mind you, this isn’t an exact match, and what I did was very crude and not terribly accurate, but I hope it’s more — wait for it, wait for it — illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool. I remember when the Voyager probes passed Saturn back in the early 80s. The pictures were incredible! We learned a lot, and it inspired a generation of would-be astronomers (including me). But those spacecraft flew by Saturn at high speed. Now we have Cassini &lt;em&gt;orbiting&lt;/em&gt; Saturn, as it has so many times since 2004, and with that residence comes views like this. It’s what happens when you plan to stick around a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their claim is that with their particular "priors" they are warranted in concluding from those "priors" the evidence leads them to their faith. My claim is that they have the cart before the horse, big time, bad time.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For if the Christian "priors" are truly "priors" then they need to be there "prior."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here you are wondering whether Christian theism is true. You were probably raised to believe in this Christian culture but now as the adult you have become you want to examine the case for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when doing so what are your "priors" at that point? That is, what do you know and when? When do you place which "priors" into your bag of "priors"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Name them in order to the best of your ability. And tell me how you arrived at them without using any subsequent ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for the punch, &lt;b&gt;Hear ye, O' hear ye!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No amount of philosophical thinking alone will produce the conclusion that any event actually took place in the past, much less a miraculous resurrection. So on the one hand, in order to establish the Christian faith believers must use historical evidence at every juncture. But on the other hand, in order to see that evidence as evidence we need to have good reasons to do so. Where do those reasons come from? Not from any “background knowledge” or “priors” of theirs. They cannot use their so-called “background knowledge” or their “priors” to help determine whether the evidence shows Jesus arose from the dead until they can first show that he did. Christians must independently establish that the resurrection took place in history before such a belief can be placed into their bag of "priors."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can even grant the existence of Yahweh or a creator god and the possibility of miracles and it changes nothing. For what needs to be shown is that Yahweh did such a miracle here in this particular case and the historical tools we have available to assess whether he did are inadequate for the task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is both obvious and non-controversial. For the very people in charge of the writing and maintenance of the OT faith, the Jews, believed in Yahweh and miracles and yet did not believe in Jesus--to this day. Yes there are pockets of Jews who do believe, but statistically not many of them at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given this I defy anyone to provide for us a clear and unequivocal non-self-fulfilling prophetic text in the OT that singles Jesus out as the only person who could fulfill it using the historical grammatical method of interpretation.

As Australia’s flu  season comes to a close, we are getting ready for ours in the Northern  Hemisphere. This is a good time to start thinking about getting the flu  vaccine, and as always there is a lot of flu vaccine news to sort  through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Crislip has already &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2040"&gt;reviewed the evidence for the efficacy&lt;/a&gt; of the seasonal flu vaccine. Like most questions in medicine, the  evidence is deceptively complex, and Mark does an excellent job of  sorting through it, so I won’t repeat it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the H1N1  pandemic flu virus will be incorporated into the seasonal flu vaccine,  so there will not be two separate vaccines as there was last year. H1N1 remains the dominant strain of seasonal flu, and as predicted the pandemic has simply been incorporated into the seasonal flu pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some updates on flu vaccine news – first the good news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Flu Vaccine Efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of the flu vaccine in improving outcomes. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6926"&gt;Mark Crislip discussed&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago a recent study that shows that the flu vaccine (but not the pneumococcal vaccine) is associated with a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855479"&gt;decreased risk of heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. This makes sense as getting the flu can be a significant physiological strain and can plausibly provoke a heart attacks in those who are susceptible. This study emphasizes the importance of getting the seasonal flu vaccine early in the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921345"&gt;Another recent study&lt;/a&gt; looked at the effect of maternal flu vaccination while pregnant and the subsequent risk of flu for their infant children. Angelia Eick et al studied 1169 mother-infant pairs among Navajo and White Mountain Apache Indian reservations and found that getting the seasonal flu vaccine while pregnant was associated with increase anti-flu antibodies up to 2-3 months old and a 41% reduction in the risk of flu in the first 6 months. This is important because young infants are generally not given the flu vaccine – they depend upon passive antibodies from the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two studies add to the body of evidence that clearly demonstrates that the flu vaccine is effective in preventing the flu and reducing morbidity. The media, however, also like to report about every flu vaccine side effect scare, whether legitimate or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H1N1 Vaccine and Narcolepsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the summer it was reported that there were a cluster of cases of narcolepsy in Finland and Sweden. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness. It is caused by a combination of genetics and environment, and can be triggered by infections with high fever. The appearance of narcolepsy in about a dozen children and adults was thought to perhaps be associated with the Pandemrix flu vaccine, and Finland promptly suspended use of this brand of flu vaccine. The possible association &lt;a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/41743/"&gt;was widely reported&lt;/a&gt; – but the follow up investigation was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden’s Medical Products Agency (MPA) investigated a possible association between narcolepsy and the flu vaccine, specifically Pandemrix, &lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep0910narcolepsy-br.html"&gt;and found no association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency’s report said six narcolepsy cases in Stockholm were in  children, two of whom had not received the Pandemrix vaccine, according  to the YLE report. Of 10 narcolepsy cases reported in adults, half had  received the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC did their own review of the vaccine adverse events reporting system (VAERS) and found no pattern of reports that would be concerning for a link between vaccines and narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly reasonable, as part of the precautionary principle, to take apparent clusters of diseases and investigate them to see if they are real or are just statistical clusterings (as Carl Sagan said – “randomness is clumpy”). It is also reasonable, and this happens often, to suspend use of a drug or medical product until a potential risk can be investigated. So there really was nothing unusual about the narcolepsy episode. Most apparent clusters like this turn out not to be real, and so it is no surprise that this was the case with narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult problem is the media response to these episodes. I would not say that such cases should not be reported, but rather that special care should be taken to put such reports into a reasonable context and to not prematurely and unnecessarily fear-monger. Further, when later investigations find that there was no risk, that should be given equal reporting – perhaps even more, as it is more difficult to quell fears than to stoke them. In addition, there is a subculture that is anti-science-based medicine, and also anti-vaccine. Such episode are exploited for propaganda purposes. It is likely that narcolepsy will now be added to the list of fears used against vaccines by such groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu Vaccine and Convulsions in Australia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in Australia there has been a real cluster of fever and seizures in children who had received a particular brand of flu vaccine, the Fluvax. New Scientist reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the Australian Department of Health and Ageing reported that flu vaccination was “causally related” to fever and convulsions  in 99 Australian children this year. Of those, 74 had no other possible cause, and Fluvax had been given to all 66 of those where the vaccine’s name was known, CSL says it is trying to identify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the narcolepsy episode, this appears to be a real cluster, and the association with a particular brand of flu vaccine statistically solid. Fever with flu vaccine is a known risk, and in young children a high fever can sometimes trigger what is called a febrile seizure. Febrile seizures, while scary for the parents, are most often benign and to not result in any permanent damage or long term seizure risk. Rarely, however, there are neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline risk of febrile seizures from the flu vaccine is about 1.4 per 10,000 doses. This is much less than what would be expected from the flu itself, and so getting the vaccine actually decreases the risk of developing febrile seizures. The Fluvax, however, was associated with a 50 fold increase in risk of febrile seizures from that normally associated with the flu vaccine. Even with this increased risk there was still more statistical benefit than risk from this vaccine, especially since the H1N1 flu (which is included in this year’s seasonal vaccine) had such a high mortality rate (1% of those children admitted to the hospital with confirmed H1N1 flu in Australia died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course this is an unacceptable side effect from the Fluvax, and since it is dramatically greater than other brands there must be something wrong with this particular batch. It is not yet known what that is. This is precisely the reason for careful post-marketing surveillance of drugs and vaccines – if unexpected side effects emerge then steps can be taken to quickly remove the offending agent from the market until the risks can be sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same company that makes Fluvax, CSL, also makes a product for the Northern Hemisphere called Afluria. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20703207"&gt;The CDC is recommending &lt;/a&gt;that this brand not be given to children under 5 years old, as other brands are also available. It is not known if Afluria carries the same increased risk as Fluvax, but again this is a reasonable application of the precautionary principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest evidence supports what is already known about the seasonal flu vaccine – it works, but it is not without risk. All medical interventions have risk and it is important to always consider risk vs benefit. When considered in this context, the evidence clearly shows that the benefit of receiving the flu vaccine far outweighs the small risk. The flu is a serious illness and preventing it carries significant benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Science-Based Medicine</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286369206974"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/off_to_get_my_flu_vaccine.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5bace5a22b339e04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Off to get my flu vaccine...</title><published>2010-10-06T13:30:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T13:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/pcENNwmxnhk/off_to_get_my_flu_vaccine.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/off_to_get_my_flu_vaccine.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's about time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cancer center is finally offering the flu vaccine for its employees, and I'm off to go and get it. I'll be sure to ask for extra thimerosal. Even though &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/index.html#2jock"&gt;Jock Doubleday's challenge seems to have disappeared&lt;/a&gt;, I'll still do it in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I'm particularly proud of my cancer center in that its leadership has made a stand by partnering with other health care institutions in the city and requiring the flu vaccine for employees who directly interact with patients. That means doctors, nurses, support staff, receptionists, pretty much everyone other than the lab rats working in the research section of the building. When we get our vaccine, we will be given a sticker to put on our employee ID. An employee can still refuse the flu vaccine, but that employee will not be given the ID sticker and, as a result, will be required to wear a mask any time he or she is in an area where patient care takes place and in patient waiting areas. It's imperfect (personally, other than medical reasons, I see no reason why employees at a cancer center, where immunosuppressed patients are cared for, should not be required to be up on all their vaccinations, including the flu vaccine every year), but it's a reasonable compromise between patient safety and personal freedom. I wish I could say I had something to do with this policy, but I didn't. I did thank our cancer center director when I heard about it, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don't return to the blog later today or sometime tomorrow, you'll know that something horrible has happened to me as a result of the flu vaccine as a result of all that deadly mercury and killed virus. Of course, the likelihood of that is slim and none; the Insolence will resume later today or tomorrow as usual. The flu vaccine may not be as effective as we wish in some years, due to the nature of the influenza virus and the ever-shifting types of flu that circulate every year, but it is effective and it is safe. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7223"&gt;The benefits certainly outweigh the tiny risks&lt;/a&gt;. Even if we are too cavalier to protect ourselves and our own loved ones, we as health care professionals owe it to patients to take at least this minimal step to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is the least a health care professional should do during the flu season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/off_to_get_my_flu_vaccine.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/pcENNwmxnhk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286368798144"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/repubicans_for_rape.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/940960d1c6c71832</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rape"/><title type="html">Republicans for Rape</title><published>2010-10-06T13:36:54Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T13:36:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/5x-7jU-mS7o/repubicans_for_rape.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/repubicans_for_rape.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/i_-oQIUsNgQ?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/repubicans_for_rape.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/5x-7jU-mS7o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286361391571"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2687">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dcf9f8fc9b3a18bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">More on infixation and code-mixing in Cantonese</title><published>2010-10-06T10:25:28Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T10:25:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2687" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My note yesterday about &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2686"&gt;Cantonese infixation into English words&lt;/a&gt; was written while changing planes on the way back from Hong Kong, and was somewhat rushed, not to say incoherent. Thanks to the commenters who helped clear things up! This morning, I'd like to add a few more references and observations about several interesting aspects of this phenomenon and its context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, Cantonese speakers often mingle English words or short phrases freely into colloquial Cantonese.  Researchers at CUHK told me (if I recall correctly) that in their collection, about 20% of Cantonese phrases included a bit of English, most often one word.   Because of the relatively fine granularity of the combination of languages,  people who study this phenomenon in Hong Kong seem to prefer the term "code mixing" to the more widely used term "code switching", which stereotypically refers to switching back and forth between languages at the level of somewhat larger syntactic units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this represents simple borrowing of English words into Cantonese — but as usual in such cases, there&amp;#39;s a spectrum of phenomena between out-and-out borrowing and switching between languages. For some discussion, see Kang-Kwong Luke &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vvCWT8XHK8QC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Why%20Two%20Languages%20Might%20be%20Better%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Why   two languages might be better than one: Motivations of language mixing  in Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;", in Martha Pennington, Ed., &lt;em&gt;Language in Hong Kong  at Century's End&lt;/em&gt;, 1998; David C.S. Li, "&lt;a href="http://members.shaw.ca/kyjennifer/research%20support.pdf"&gt;Cantonese-English code-switching research in Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;World Englishes&lt;/em&gt; 19(3) 2000; Joyce Y.C. Chan et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2005/i05_1533.html"&gt;Development of a Cantonese-English Code-Mixing Speech Corpus&lt;/a&gt;", InterSpeech 2005; and &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Cantonese+code-mixing&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;many other references&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infixation examples noted yesterday are an especially interesting case of &amp;quot;code mixing&amp;quot;. A larger set of examples can be found in Matthews &amp;amp; Yip, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=czbGJLu59S0C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1994, who write that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In colloquial Cantonese certain words may be infixed inside a morpheme (stem). The expletive &lt;em&gt;gwái&lt;/em&gt; 'devil, ghost', used to emphasize adjectives (9.1.2), may be infixed not only  single morphemes but also morpheme boundaries, compound words and phrases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They give these examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY2.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They observe that "Other expletive words, many more offensive than the relatively mild &lt;em&gt;gwái&lt;/em&gt;, may be infixed similarly". It's also clear that the syntax as well as morphology of this phenomenon deserves some attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gwái&lt;/em&gt; is very versatile and may be used in many other contexts such as questions for rhetorical effects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY3.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY3.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even give some examples of recursive infixation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY4.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CantoneseMY4.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Yu, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arthaey.com/conlang/papers/Natural%20History%20of%20Infixation.pdf"&gt;A Natural History of Infixation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, OUP 2007, points out that the phonology of this infixation process exhibits some interesting variation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The exact distribution of this infix is complicated by the fact that it might also interact with foot structure. Some quadrisyllabic words show variation in the distribution of the infix; the infix may appear after the first syllable or after the first disyllabic string (139)c. One interpretation of this variation is that the infix wants to be after the first prosodic constituent of a string. Assuming that quadrisyllabic words are analyzed as consisting of two disyllabic feet, the wh-word may appear after the first foot or the first syllable. Thus, while it is difficult to substantiate the need for a first-syllable pivot on the strength of one set of evidence, the Cantonese evidence nonetheless provides a strong case for such a pivot. Future research might turn up more supporting evidence for this pivot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’ve missed just about every episode of &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt;… but I know enough about it to download the soundtracks and realize that last night’s episode was all about faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Kate&lt;/strong&gt;, who writes the very-well-written-and-why-wasn’t-I-reading-this-before &lt;a href="http://www.suburbansweetheart.com/"&gt;Suburban Sweetheart blog&lt;/a&gt;, was nice enough to explain the episode to me. And now, to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a couple spoilers in case you plan to watch the episode later. You’ve been warned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After seeing last Tuesday’s preview, I was excited for the new episode of &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Puck singing Billy Joel.&lt;br&gt;
2) GOSPEL MUSIC. Does anyone &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; love gospel music?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a mere three minutes into last night’s show, I was already uncomfortable. It wasn’t just that &lt;strong&gt;Finn&lt;/strong&gt; claimed to see Jesus in his grilled cheese (“Grilled Cheesus”), which was funny, or that he asked &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Shue&lt;/strong&gt; if the Glee Club could perform songs praising Christ, which was unfortunately a bit too reminiscent of my own high school choir experience. No, it wasn’t just those pieces of the plot: It was &lt;strong&gt;Kurt&lt;/strong&gt;‘s story that made me squirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_t6rV3U9ZEHM/TKvaMe3HJHI/AAAAAAAA7Es/sWSo74ryYfQ/s1600/GrilledCheesus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_t6rV3U9ZEHM/TKvaMe3HJHI/AAAAAAAA7Es/sWSo74ryYfQ/s1600/GrilledCheesus.jpg" title="Cheesus" width="450" height="311"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt is the gay kid who angrily shuns religion because, he says, if there were a God, S/he wouldn’t have given him a life of being gay, a life of bullying and belittling. Within the first 10 minutes of the episode, &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt;‘s portrayal of Kurt as an atheist sets up two unfortunate and all-too-prevalent stereotypes: that of the angsty homosexual &amp;amp; that of the militant atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Hummel"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/KurtGlee.png/415px-KurtGlee.png" title="Kurt" width="415" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the board, the other Glee Club members, Christians &amp;amp; Jews alike, are shocked by Kurt’s admission that he doesn’t believe in God. Throughout the show, they try to talk him out of atheism and into religion, never once acknowledging that he’s entitled to his own beliefs — or lack thereof — or showing any respect for his views. In fact, the only character to defend Kurt’s atheism as a legitimate world view is &lt;strong&gt;Sue Sylvester&lt;/strong&gt;, the show’s antagonist, who goes on to use his atheism as a tool of manipulation to help sink her arch nemesis, Mr. Shue, for permitting religious music in Glee Club. This is where I should note that, in writing this, I’m also ignoring the show’s inaccurate portrayals of church/state separation and what is and isn’t permitted in public schools; last night’s episode toed across the line there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hemant adds: Sylvester &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/channel/houstonbelief/commons/theemmausroad.html"&gt;said the following&lt;/a&gt; in the episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Asking someone to believe in a fantasy, however comforting, is an immoral thing to do.  It’s cruel.  It’s as arrogant as telling someone how to believe in God, and if they don’t accept it, no matter how open-hearted or honest their dissent, they’re going to hell.  That doesn’t sound very Christian, does it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting… Now, back to Kate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unfortunate part of the episode is that the story line was valid: Kurt, terrified of losing his father to a heart problem, is genuinely struggling to deal with his pain; his friends want to help, but they’re not sure what they can do for an atheist who doesn’t want their prayers — because prayer is the most common way they know of for dealing with such situations. Yes, it was a believable plotline — but if &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; wanted to teach an important lesson, as it has so often done, there was ample opportunity to do so in a way that didn’t offend. The writers could’ve focused on Kurt pushing his friends away as a result of his dad’s condition, a natural but unhealthy reaction to dealing with fear. They could’ve lessened the strain, the anger, the push-&amp;amp;-pull between the religious members of Glee Club and the one atheist member. “I appreciate your thoughts,” Kurt tells them, “but I don’t want your prayers.” And not one of them will accept that: They show up at his father’s bedside to pray. They dedicate church services to him. They try to sing songs about God’s grace. And never once does anyone but Sue Sylvester stop to recognize how offensive it is to push your beliefs, no matter how well-intentioned, upon someone else — especially when that person is already enveloped in hurt and grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I typically appreciate “Glee’s” depictions of diversity — in many cases, its sense of humor and refusal to be politically correct in order to make important observations about society — I was undoubtedly disappointed in the way the writers opted to depict Kurt’s atheism. But you know what? It didn’t do much for religion, either. Why do the other Glee Clubbers have to be so forceful in insisting that they pray for Kurt’s father, both in front of and to Kurt? Couldn’t they have kept it to themselves? And out of school? Their insistence that Kurt recognize the power of prayer is just as dangerous in its characterization of all people of faith as pushy, well-intentioned zealots as was the show’s portrayal of Kurt as a defensive, angry atheist. (Not to mention that I was frustrated that the episode described religion, in blanket terms, as being intolerant of homosexuality — NOT the case for all of us!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the show, though, I suppose the atheist wins. After all, Kurt is the only character to recognize his friends’ good intentions and overlook their hurtful actions because of them. His friends and educators, for their part, never really recognize that they’ve hurt him or apologize for doing so. And though &lt;strong&gt;Mercedes&lt;/strong&gt; concedes to understanding that he doesn’t believe in “the power of prayer,” she continues to passively urge him to find God, indicating that she cannot conceive of the wrongness of her actions toward her friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this point, the only credit I give the writers of &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; for last night’s episode is that (spoiler alert!) the episode did NOT end with Kurt’s becoming a believer, which would’ve been an even bigger letdown, and it did address the things that he, as an atheist, turned to instead of religion to get him through a difficult time. The memory montage of his childhood — including his mother’s funeral — was set to his emotional performance of The Beatles’ “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” the one song of the night that (purposefully) didn’t reference God or religion as a means of highlighting his faith in family and love as a source of personal strength. He did, however, allow Mercedes take him to her church, where she performed “Bridge Over Troubled Water” for him, and where he ultimately accepted his friends’ prayers for his father as an act of friendship, not of proselytization.  Unfortunately, the grief it took to make these few progressive points wasn’t worth all the other reprehensible depictions both of atheism and of religion. I wish the writers had explored other creative ways to incorporate religious tunes (which is, really, a fun concept!) into an episode and to address faith (and the lack thereof) without turning the entire cast into an offensive — and largely incorrect — parade of stereotypes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Habits are those behaviours that have become automatic, triggered by a cue in the environment rather than by conscious will. Health psychologists are interested for obvious reasons - they want to assist people in breaking unhealthy habits, while helping them adopt healthy ones. Remarkably, although there are plenty of habit-formation theories, before now, no-one had actually studied habits systematically as they are formed.

Phillippa Lally and her team recruited 96 undergrads (mean age 27) and asked them to adopt a new health-related behaviour, to be repeated once a day for the next 84 days. The new behaviour had to be linked to a daily cue. Examples chosen by the participants included going for a 15 minute run before dinner;  eating a piece of fruit with lunch; and doing 50 sit-ups after morning coffee. The participants also logged onto a website each day, to report whether they&amp;#39;d performed the behaviour on the previous day, and to fill out a self-report measure of the behaviour&amp;#39;s automaticity. Example items included &amp;#39;I do it automatically&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;I do it without thinking&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;d find it hard not to do&amp;#39;. 

Of the 82 participants who saw the study through to the end, the most common pattern of habit formation was for early repetitions of the chosen behaviour to produce the largest increases in its automaticity. Over time, further increases in automaticity dwindled until a plateau was reached beyond which extra repetitions made no difference to the automaticity achieved.

The average time to reach maximum automaticity was 66 days, although this varied greatly between participants from 18 days to a predicted 254 days (assuming the still rising rate of change in automaticity at the study end were to be continued beyond the study&amp;#39;s 84 days). This is much longer than most previous estimates of the time taken to acquire a new habit - for example a 1988 book claimed a behaviour is habitual once it&amp;#39;s been performed at least twice a month, at least ten times. In fact, even after 84 days, about half of the current study participants had failed to achieve a high enough automaticity score for their new behaviour to be considered a habit.

Unsurprisingly perhaps, more complex behaviours were found to take longer to become habits. Participants who&amp;#39;d chosen an exercise behaviour took about one and a half times as long to reach their automaticity plateau compared with the participants who adopted new eating or drinking behaviours.

What about the effect of having a day off from the behaviour? Writing in 1890, William James said that a behaviour must be repeated without omission for it to become a habit. The new results found that a single missed day had little impact on later automaticity gains, either early in the study or later on, suggesting James may have overestimated the effect of a missed repetition. However, there was some evidence that too many missed repeats of the behaviour, even if spread out over time, had a cumulative effect, reducing the maximum automaticity level that was ultimately reached.

It seems the message of this research for those seeking to establish a new habit is to repeat the behaviour every day if you can, but don&amp;#39;t worry excessively if you miss a day or two. Also be prepared for the long haul - remember the average time to reach peak automaticity was 66 days. 

This research has a serious shortcoming, acknowledged by the researchers, which is that it depended entirely on participants&amp;#39; ability to report the automaticity of their own behaviour. Also, the amount of data made it hard to form clear conclusions about the need for consistency in building a habit. However, the study provides an exciting new approach for exploring habit formation and future research could easily remedy these shortcomings.

Iago, Act III scene iii of Shakespeare&amp;#39;s OthelloOthello syndrome is a rare psychiatric condition marked by morbid, pathological, or delusional jealousy (Miller et al., 2010). It can occur in the context of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, or epilepsy, but sometimes it&amp;#39;s observed in relative isolation from other delusions (Todd &amp;amp; Dewhurst, 1955). As in the Shakespearean tragedy, the modern day patient with Othello syndrome presents with the potential for violence against his spouse and/or self because of the imagined infidelities.A recent article by Miller and colleagues (2010) provides a helpful overview of this delusional disorder for nurses and other clinicians. They consider treatment options (antipsychotics for those with psychosis, dialectical behavioral therapy for those without), safety issues, nursing care, and best practices. Although cases from the recent literature were reviewed, a classic article from over 50 yrs ago (Todd &amp;amp; Dewhurst, 1955) is a more entertaining treasure trove of paranoid sexual jealousy. Excerpts from several cases are presented below.Case 2: A married man, 43 years old, was first admitted to a mental hospital in June 1951. He complained of feeling &amp;quot;tensed up&amp;quot; as a result of the belief that his wife was unfaithful to him. Careful enquiries showed that there was not a scrap of evidence to support his suspicions, which began when a workmate allegedly asked him whether he had ever suspected his wife of having an affair with another man. His suspicions increased considerably when one day she failed to give what he deemed to be a satisfactory explanation for the origin of a smart pair of bootees in her possession. ... Once, he attempted to strangle his wife but was stopped in the nick of time by the intervention of neighbors. Another time, he rushed scantily clad from the house in a fruitless attempt to catch his wife with a paramour.Although the patient was not deemed to be a chronic alcoholic, his jealousy was closely related to bouts of drinking. His identical twin brother suffered from grand mal epilepsy and committed suicide. The patient&amp;#39;s own EEG showed epileptiform discharges, but he never had an overt seizure.Diagnosis: epilepsy with delusions of infidelity.Case 3: A married man, 49 years old, was first admitted to a mental hospital in July 1952. He complained of chronic anxiety arising from a belief that his wife was &amp;quot;carrying on&amp;quot; with a number of men. ... At times, his behavior had been distinctly bizarre. One day, which searching her handbag for &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot;, he had chanced upon a discarded pair of knickers which she had pressed into service as a duster. He insisted that the dilapidated and soiled condition of the garment proved beyond doubt that she had been her employer&amp;#39;s mistress. He had, on several occasions, attempted to strangle his wife as a result of his delusions.Diagnosis: paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of infidelity.Case 7: A married man, 39 years old, was admitted to a mental hospital in May 1951, as the direct result of disorderly behavior arising from delusions concerning his wife&amp;#39;s fidelity. During the previous year, he had rendered his wife (a virtuous woman) miserable by repeatedly accusing her of infidelity on an enormous scale. He would use field glasses to spy on her from afar, and, after pretending to leave the house, he was wont to re-enter surreptitiously in an attempt to trap her with a lover. ... He threatened several men in the neighborhood with violence because he suspected them of a liaison with his wife, and developed a sinister habit of going abroad with an open razor in his pocket.He also had the charming practice of expressing remorse that he couldn&amp;#39;t keep his wife perpetually pregnant, he threatened her with violence, and once even grabbed her by the throat. This bad behavior ran in the family. His brothers were drunk, impotent, jealous, and &amp;quot;unfit to be trusted with a dog, never mind a woman.&amp;quot; His father was:a drunkard and libertine, [who] had rendered his wife pregnant on 28 occasions [how can that be possible??]; in addition, he had many extramarital affairs.Diagnosis: epilepsy with delusions of infidelity.Case 7 was given &amp;quot;a course of electro-shock therapy&amp;quot; which isn&amp;#39;t such a great idea for someone with epilepsy, and it didn&amp;#39;t cure his delusions, either. Chlorpromazine wasn&amp;#39;t yet widely available in 1951, but the anticonvulsant Dilantin (phenytoin) was on the market in the 1930s.He was still hospitalized four years later.In their Study in the Psychopathology of Sexual Jealousy, Drs. Todd and Dewhurst (1955) did not seem to prescribe medications of any sort, but they did give a wonderful literary discussion of Boccaccio, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, and Burton&amp;#39;s The Anatomy of Melancholy.ReferencesMiller, M., Kummerow, A., &amp;amp; Mgutshini, T.

&lt;p&gt;The Houston area skeptics, along with a few hundred other guests, were treated to a lecture from renowned evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins, Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins spoke at the fabulous &lt;a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/worthamcenter/"&gt;Wortham Center&lt;/a&gt; in Houston’s Theater District, which is no small venue for a scientist. In fact, it’s quite an impressive place for anyone to speak. And being Dawkins’ first time to visit the Space City, the Bayou City, the Big Steamy, his presentation was equal to the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have to admit to having been bored by Dawkins’ speeches before. Not the ideas contained therein, but his manner of public address has perhaps caught me after lunch or when I have missed out on a full night sleep for some reason, because I have been perilously close to napping more than once. But on this occasion, there was no such danger. And I have to think it was me all along, because he spoke in the same manner as before, and spoke about the same ideas as before, and I thoroughly enjoyed the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston skeptics, and other followers of science and scientific issues, really found nothing new in the presentation, as Dawkins program was basically a high-level summary of his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Show-Earth-Evidence-Evolution/dp/1416594787"&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But even for those old hats, hearing the evidence for evolution laid out in such an eloquent fashion is a value add, to employ a bit of tired corporate vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get comfortable with the concept of evolution, and we know all the scientific and rational arguments to refute a denier, but often, unless we work in the field, we don’t always consider the specific evidence for it, and just how powerful it is and the levels it covers. Dawkins’ book reminds us of that, and his talk reminds us of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if he’s coming through your town with this program, get your local group together, have a nice dinner, and then enjoy an evening listening to a pretty bright guy discuss the evidence for one of the most amazing scientific ideas ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286337248236"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=19832">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2fc07c42d4e8ff0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><category term="human evolution"/><category term="Smithsonian"/><category term="USNM"/><category term="museums"/><title type="html">The Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History</title><published>2010-10-06T03:53:45Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T03:53:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/"&gt;Hall of Human Origins&lt;/a&gt;, a new permanent exhibition at the &lt;a href="http://www.si.edu/"&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/"&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; (aka the USNM) opened last March (at which time &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/new-human-evolution-hall-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;I got only a peek&lt;/a&gt;), and over the summer I finally got a chance to take in the whole exhibit. Like Edward Rothstein of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/arts/design/19museum.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;sq=koch%20rothstein&amp;amp;st=cse&amp;amp;scp=1"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;I noted in an &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/new-human-evolution-hall-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I have somewhat mixed feelings. There are many excellent displays in the hall, and it does bear “repeated, close viewing” (which is to my mind the highest praise for a museum exhibit), but there are also lost opportunities, slack use of space and objects, and, frankly, abdication of curatorial responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve mentioned &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/a-day-at-the-museum/"&gt;in earlier posts&lt;/a&gt;, I’m a fan of the “cabinet” style in natural history museums. This style emphasizes well-labeled displays rich in the number and diversity of specimens and objects on display. An alternative style, which I’ve taken to calling “interactive”, is characterized by sparse specimens, large fonts, blank space, and interactive displays. Along with the late &lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2483"&gt;Steve Gould&lt;/a&gt;, I’m less fond of this style. First, some of the good stuff. The hall opens with a number of reproductions of well-known hominid skulls, such as this &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus boisei&lt;/em&gt; (one could quibble with some of the taxonomy adopted in the exhibit, but it’s not a major concern of most visitors, and I’ll use what’s in the labels). For complex three-dimensional structures, such as skulls, the ability to walk around, look under, and touch the object greatly enhances the visitor’s grasp of the object, and I applaud taking some of the skulls out of the display cases, and putting them into the hall and the visitor’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19833" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5241/"&gt;&lt;img title="KNM-ER 406" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5241.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranthropus boisei, KNM-ER 406&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two skeletons, nearly complete, of &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;, are well-labeled, and, placed side-by side, allow the visitor to compare and contrast their form, while the signage guides the eye to particularly interesting parts, and their interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19834" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5272/"&gt;&lt;img title="Homo erectus (left) and Homo neanderthalensis" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5272-e1286328026740.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homo erectus (left) and Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit includes a number of life reconstructions of hominid heads by &lt;a href="http://www.gurche.com/main_frameset.htm"&gt;John Gurche&lt;/a&gt;. Any life reconstruction must be a work of art as well as science, and is, of necessity, in part speculative. Gurche is well-known for making his art as informed as possible by science, and the fact that corresponding skulls for most or all of the life reconstructions are in the exhibit allows the visitor to compare the art with the inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19837" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5266/"&gt;&lt;img title="Paranthropus boisei" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5266-e1286328845216.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranthropus boisei (skull pictured in first photo in post)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked some large bronzes scattered about, which, like Gurche’s life reconstructions, are both art and science, and, like the skull casts, walk-aroundable. They reminded me of &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TvDiUjSnYKwC&amp;amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Carl Akeley’s &lt;/a&gt;famous bronzes, found at museum such as the &lt;a href="http://www.galenfrysinger.com/chicago_field_museum_akeley_statues.htm"&gt;Field in Chicago,&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/virtual/bison/ake_art.php"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://images.library.amnh.org/photos/ptm/catalog/desc/179978/3"&gt;Musuem&lt;/a&gt; in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19844" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5260/"&gt;&lt;img title="Mother and child" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5260-e1286329707353.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mother and child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleoanthropological materials (bones, tools, art) are sufficiently rare that even great museums like the USNM must rely on reproductions for most of the display materials. This is a disappointment, but understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19847" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5251/"&gt;&lt;img title="Art reproductions" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5251.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient art works-- note that they are all casts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some aspects of the hall, generally those in the more “interactive” style were less successful to my mind. Here is the theme of the hall–  “What does it mean to be human?”– which to me seems an ill-formed question, not subject to any clearly comprehensible response. I was tempted to say, “&lt;a href="http://www.quetek.com/dictionary/deep-thought-and-42.html"&gt;Fortytwo&lt;/a&gt;.” Note that the exhibit designers quickly translate the theme to a different, and more answerable, question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19845" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5239/"&gt;&lt;img title="The hall&amp;#39;s theme" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5239.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hall&amp;#39;s theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some early parts of the hall don’t seem to make good use of the space available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19846" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5246/"&gt;&lt;img title="DSCN5246" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5246.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really lost opportunity is presented by a “cave wall” with fine reproductions of cave art, but little or nothing to guide or inform the visitor as to the import of what is displayed. There is some interpretive signage, but it’s in another case, not closely adjacent. As &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/"&gt;Edward Tufte&lt;/a&gt; has urged, we should integrate our images, words, numbers, and –for museums– objects; keeping all within an eyespan. These are thrilling achievements by among the earliest of human artists, but we are given little to go on in interpreting them, and our appreciation stays at a purely aesthetic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19848" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5252/"&gt;&lt;img title="Horse and hands" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5252.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horse and hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19849" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5253/"&gt;&lt;img title="Lion (?) heads" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5253.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion (?) heads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the exhibit I found most wanting is the reproduction of a famous cave painting known as “The Sorcerer”, an anthropomorphic figure that combines deer and man.  The reproduction is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19850" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5258/"&gt;&lt;img title="The Sorcerer" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5258-e1286332641568.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sorcerer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the signage (enalrged below) is not fine. The question “What do you see?” reflects a trend in pedagogy and museum display that is thought to be ‘active’, and ‘inquiry’ based. But you can’t make intelligent inquiries into something about which you know nothing. Are those the antlers of a caribou or a red deer? Are the dark markings in the leg similar to the bones or the muscles? And do they look like parts of a deer or of a man? What other paintings, if any,  are on this wall? Have any artifacts or bones been found in the cave? What animals lived in the area at the time? Without addressing these and many other questions, your inquiry goes nowhere. You may have an opinion, and it may feel good to have your opinion asked for, but your opinion is worthless– it is an uninformed speculation at best. The curators have abdicated their responsibility to provide the necessary context, and to share with us their &lt;em&gt;informed &lt;/em&gt;opinion. They may of course be wrong, and further discoveries or reflection might lead us and them to another interpretation, but this does not excuse them for not letting us know what they think. I do not want to know what the visitor next to me sees, or even what I see; what I want to know is what is seen by the men and women who have studied this painting and its context most thoroughly, and reflected on it most deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19851" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5257/"&gt;&lt;img title="What do you see?" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5257.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course the now requisite interactive displays. (Note the question on the right!) &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/jerry-as-a-neanderthal/"&gt;Jerry has been to the exhibit&lt;/a&gt; on his current east coast tour, and he will likely have more to say about this aspect when he posts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-19854" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/the-hall-of-human-origins-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/dscn5275/"&gt;&lt;img title="Can the concept of evolution co-exist with religious faith?" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dscn5275.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the concept of evolution co-exist with religious faith?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d give the exhibit a B- ; it does, as Edward Rothstein said, repay close and repeated viewing, but it could have been more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An odd item I’ll close on are the curious politics of David Koch, chief funder of the exhibit (it’s actually called the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins). As I &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/new-human-evolution-hall-at-the-national-museum-of-natural-history/"&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt;, he’s a &lt;a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/03/17/smithsonian-koch-crimes/"&gt;global warming denialist&lt;/a&gt;, and, as Frank Rich of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/opinion/29rich.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=rich%20koch%20tea&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;recently detailed&lt;/a&gt;, along with his brother, he’s a major funder of the tea party movement. Since &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/#39467428"&gt;tea partiers&lt;/a&gt; tend to be &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/09/15/odonnell-evolution/"&gt;creationists&lt;/a&gt;, this is a real head scratcher– what is Koch thinking? The people he’s funding would probably want the USNM shut down. (I did keep an eye out for anything about climate in the exhibit, but noticed nothing untoward.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you frustrated by the prevalence of pseudoscience in medicine? Are you interested in critical thinking and science? Is SBM your rational refuge?  Want to meet like-minded science advocates? On October 23, 2010 four Skepticamps will take place across Canada. If you enjoy reading this blog, you’ll probably enjoy Skepticamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, Skepticamp involves no actual camping. It’s a flexibly organized, collaborative conference on science and critical thinking. &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Skepticamp&lt;/a&gt; is not your typical medical conference with high fees, bad PowerPoint, long talks and little interaction with speakers. Skepticamps are open, collaborative, interactive, and FREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the four events, and a few of the SBM-related highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://vancouver.skepticamp.org/"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;: ear candling; dopamine as an explanatory model for superstition; and SBM copy editor &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=222"&gt;Paul Ingraham&lt;/a&gt; speaking about his first year as an alternative medicine apostate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/SkeptiCamp_Winnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;: fad diets and detoxes; homeopathy; and the continued relevance of vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/SkeptiCamp_Ottawa_2010"&gt;Ottawa:&lt;/a&gt; self-help cults; genes and inherited diseases; science denial; and forensic science&lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/SkeptiCamp_Ottawa_2010"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticamp.org/wiki/SkeptiCamp_Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;: I’ll be speaking about natural health product regulation. Other talks include a guide to the medical literature; the cognitive underpinnings of sympathetic magic; and naturopathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one near you, consider attending Skepticamp on October 23. Given it’s free, Skepticamp offers tremendous value-for-money. We invite our American colleagues to grab their passports, make a break for the border, and keep driving until there are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons"&gt;Tim Hortons&lt;/a&gt; everywhere. And if you’re attending the Toronto Skepticamp, be sure to  say hello.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Scott Gavura</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Science-Based Medicine</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286335278916"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=6215">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55f629948dc0d87b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">I write like…</title><published>2010-10-06T03:00:18Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T03:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/10/i-write-like/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286334416155"><id gr:original-id="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2010/2010_10/Growth.htm">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f84e5d385442d5a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">A Lack of Energy May Increase the Size of Human Civilization</title><published>2010-10-05T20:50:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T20:50:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/hBYdO0WNHbk/Growth.htm" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2010/2010_10/Growth.htm"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">John DeLong (Yale University, United States) and coworkers present a paradoxical finding, namely that a lack of available energy supplies will enable the human population to keep on growing, rather than stabilize, in the coming decades.

Some studies have found that testosterone production goes down in fans of the losing side (for example, among male McCain supporters after the 2008 Presidential vote). And others found the hormone goes up among supporters of a winning team. Now this paper in last month&amp;#39;s Evolution and Human Behavior claims to have found a practical consequence: After U.S. elections, it found, Internet searches for porn are more frequent in states that voted for the winners.

The authors, Patrick and Charlotte Markey, want to show that human beings can be included in a general theory about ups and downs in testosterone.  First proposed 20 years ago by the great ornithologist John C. Wingfield and his colleagues, this &amp;quot;challenge hypothesis&amp;quot; proposes that males in some species need high testosterone when they have to win a mate or defend a territory, but then have to throttle back in order to keep a monogamous pair bond and/or spend energy in caring for offspring.  In these creatures, a &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot; relevant to breeding makes their testosterone go up. On the other hand, in a species like the house mouse, where fathers are neither mated nor involved with caring for the young, testosterone levels jump at sexual maturity and then stay steady.

Human males aren&amp;#39;t particularly monogamous and aren&amp;#39;t inevitably involved in childcare. But a few years back John Archer proposed that people, like some birds, do have a life-cycle in which they need high testosterone for some tasks (impressing chicks) and less for others (raising chicks). Hence, the human version of the challenge hypothesis: Men&amp;#39;s testosterone will rise in response to sexual arousal and to competition.

Which bring us back to post-election porn-surfing. The usual way to measure the effect of an election on testosterone levels is to collect spit and measure its hormone content.  The Markeys ingeniously suggest using Google&amp;#39;s search-term data instead.  They looked at the 2004 and 2008 Presidential elections, and at the 2006 midterms. In 2004, they write, post-election searches on the ten most common porn words were higher in states carried by President Bush. In 2006, when Democrats won the Senate and House, porn searches went up in the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; states instead. Ditto for 2008, when the Democrats won the White House.

Maybe that means what the Markeys say it means—that getting off on election success gave happy male partisans a testosterone upsurge, which then made them want to get off in other ways. But there are a lot of alternative explanations.  We don&amp;#39;t know, after all, which voters in those states were porn-seeking. And if testosterone falls in response to your team&amp;#39;s loss, but rises in response to sexual arousal, then porn-hunting could be a form of self-medication for losers, rather than a sign that the winners are getting jiggy.  (Consider the example of the man whom Jimmy Carter considers our greatest ex-president: In September 1966, Carter lost a race for Governor of Georgia, and he was &amp;quot;very distressed&amp;quot; about it. His daughter Amy, 15 years younger than her elder brother, was born a year later.)

This interpretation might jibe with the Obama-McCain study I mentioned, which found that, while McCain voters&amp;#39; testosterone dropped after his loss, the Obama voters&amp;#39; didn&amp;#39;t  rise, but just held steady.

On the other hand, perhaps pornography searches occur more often on busy news days, because people spend more time on their computers looking for word about that toss-up Senate seat until 2 a.m.  Or perhaps it&amp;#39;s simply impossible to infer anything hormonal from this information. The interaction of testosterone and the conscious mind is a two-way process, after all: In this study, sports fans&amp;#39; testosterone went up only when they felt their team had deserved to win, not when the victory came through dumb luck.

Still, the data are what they are, and they&amp;#39;re interesting.  It suggests, for one thing, that porn sites might want to ready themselves for next month&amp;#39;s red-state tidal wave.

Björneborn and Ingwersen (2004) defined webometrics as &amp;quot;the study of the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of information resources, structures and technologies on the Web drawing on bibliometric and informetric approaches.&amp;quot; I guess this definition will have to do for the time being. Thelwall*, Klitkou, Verbeek, Stuart and Vincent (2010) set out to find in which fields webometrics is most effective. The result is quite a long paper, that I&amp;#39;m going to be very general about its conclusions. As expected, webometrics doesn&amp;#39;t have the same effectiveness in every field. It is at its best with emerging and/or &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; fields. That is because web publication is easier and faster than publication in traditional scientific outlets, and researchers can publish ongoing results with little delay.In some disciplines plenty of their products aren&amp;#39;t regularly published in journals (social sciences, humanities, applied fields, etc.) and therefore aren&amp;#39;t as well-covered by bibliometrical databases as disciplines with a journal-publishing culture. Bibliometrics is also bound to have a poor coverage of multidisciplinary fields, because their outputs are published in various outlets and are often cited in different manners. In general, webometrics analysis gives better results in fields with standards and/or norms for web publishing, but the results might not be reliable in fields where a small number of research groups and their projects (databases, web portals and so on) have an disproportional web presence. Collaborations are often better caught in webometric analysis, since not all collaborative works have &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; outputs. Webometrics works better for smaller fields. It&amp;#39;s harder to get a complete picture of large fields with current methods. Last but not least: webometric analysis is usually  faster and cheaper than bibliometric one.Thelwall and his colleagues concluded that &amp;quot;whilst webometrics is still inferior to bibliometrics for most purposes it seems that it has advantages for some types of field, particularly new, small fields, and can deliver policy-relevant (process) indicators to promote effective collaboration and communication,&amp;quot; (in short: use with caution). Appropriate disclosure: Prof. Thelwall is one of my dissertation advisors . My favorite from his long list of achievements is that he managed to publish a serious research paper including a YouTube cat video.

In this case, the being is Misha. He was one of the first people to have his genome sequenced, and he’s chronicled the experience in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the endorsement I sent to Misha’s publisher back in the spring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our genomes pose a paradox. They are at once profoundly intimate and remotely abstract. Misha Angrist blasts the paradox apart with Here Is A Human Being. He bravely explores what it really means for him to be able to gaze at his own genome, not by simply considering the nature of his particular gene variants, but also probing the many ways that genomics is going to influence society as a whole. A fascinating, unique book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is coming out at the start of November. To celebrate the occasion, Misha and I will “be in conversation,” as they say, &lt;a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com/events_detail.aspx?evtid=549"&gt;at Labyrinth Books in New Haven on Saturday, November 6, at 6 pm&lt;/a&gt;.

Roney's (2003) writing little had been done to tease out cognitive mechanisms that underlie this adaptive preference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roney thus set out to ascertain the ability of ecological cues to prime and activate psychological constructs related to mate attraction and establish linkages between human mating and social cognition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his &lt;strong&gt;first study&lt;/strong&gt;, participants - young students from the 10th and 12th grades of a Midwestern high school - were made to answer three large booklets of surveys. However, the manipulation of the environment within which the surveys were answered was as follows: in the &lt;em&gt;first condition&lt;/em&gt;, all participants were male; in the &lt;em&gt;second condition&lt;/em&gt;, all participants were female; in the &lt;em&gt;last condition&lt;/em&gt;, males and females were present during the study. Without knowing what the experimenter was up to, participants answered questions in the surveys, and nested in those surveys were questions related to one's attitudes towards wealth and resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results fascinatingly appear to support evolutionary theories about human mating. Male students in the mixed-sex environment reported higher valuations of material wealth than did male students in the same-sex environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-nAz6_P8njU/TKtpwETU-BI/AAAAAAAABEc/EhsRRjLwSMg/s1600/Untitled.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="TEXT-ALIGN:center;MARGIN:0px auto 10px;WIDTH:400px;DISPLAY:block;HEIGHT:308px" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-nAz6_P8njU/TKtpwETU-BI/AAAAAAAABEc/EhsRRjLwSMg/s400/Untitled.bmp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The young men in the mixed-sex condition also reported higher ratings of having an active dating life. These findings suggest that the presence of females may have primed implicit mate attraction goals and, subsequently, the activation of cognitive attitudes associated with mating objectives (detailed manipulation checks were conducted via cleverly placed questions on items such as current relationship status and mate preferences, reducing the possibility of confounding variables).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that the first experiment appears to be consistent with evolutionary theory predictions, Roney sought to find out if other mating goal-related attributes in men can be primed. In his &lt;strong&gt;second study&lt;/strong&gt;, male participants were exposed to advertisements featuring either &lt;em&gt;younger female models&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;older female models&lt;/em&gt;, after which they filled out a questionnaire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results again confirm evolutionary theory hypotheses - men in the &lt;em&gt;younger models condition&lt;/em&gt; reported higher valuations of wealth (replicating the findings of the first study), had a greater desire to display/showcase talent and, interestingly, listed self-descriptive traits that increase men's odds of attracting women (this was confirmed through separate ratings of the male participants' self-descriptive traits by women), such as ambitiousness and aggressiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roney's study thus brings evolutionary psychology one step further by utilizing ecologically realistic stimuli, in the process demonstrating powerful but previously unknown psychological effects. Specific to this study, visual exposure to young women caused significant changes in the attitudes and personality trait descriptions of the young male participants. In particular, young men who were exposed to young women reported far more favourable attitudes towards material wealth than did men exposed to either other men or older women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This makes sense because if securing a mate was an important task in ensuring the survival of one's lineage (without which those of us alive today wouldn't be here), then there should be psychological mechanisms present to facilitate the achievement of such goals, and men should thus be sensitive to cues that relate to both potential mates and resources. Using an adaptive basis for understanding psychology can also prove useful, because without this evolutionary context of mating, such stable behavioural changes demonstrated in Roney's study can, at best, only appear random and lead to invalid conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="PADDING-BOTTOM:5px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:5px;FLOAT:left;PADDING-TOP:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img style="BORDER-BOTTOM:0px;BORDER-LEFT:0px;BORDER-TOP:0px;BORDER-RIGHT:0px" alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver="&gt;Roney, J.

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to get up in the morning to put in an hour at the gym. And it’s hard to force yourself to run for 45 minutes after working all day. Basically, motivating yourself to get your daily dose of exercise is really tough. Wouldn’t it be awesome if someone &lt;a href="http://www.thatsfit.com/2010/10/05/earndit-exercise-to-earn-rewards/"&gt;paid you to exercise&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your prayers are answered. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Earndit&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href="http://nikerunning.nike.com/nikeos/p/nikeplus/language_tunnel/"&gt;Nike +&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://foursquare.com/"&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.everytrail.com/"&gt;Everytrail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://connect.garmin.com/"&gt;Garmin Connect&lt;/a&gt;, and (soon) &lt;a href="http://www.fitbit.com/"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt; to track your workouts. Every time you check in at the gym on Foursquare, you get 15 points. Every time you use Nike + to track your run, you’ll get a certain number of points per mile. And while points don’t directly translate to dollars, you can cash them in for coupons, freebies, and other cool loot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would this work for you? Or do you feel like sometimes nothing would get you out of bed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you were in college and in your twenties, you may have gossiped  about your sex life like the famous foursome Carrie, Miranda, Samantha  and Charlotte on “&lt;a href="http://television.aol.com/show/sex-and-the-city/53301/main"&gt;Sex and the City.&lt;/a&gt;”  But, later in life, you may have skirted the discussion, leaving the  pillow talk for moments you shared with your partner — until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of Indiana University sexual health researchers published the  National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior on Friday in a special  issue of &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291743-6109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The survey, the most in-depth analysis of its kind released in almost  two decades, offers a peek behind the bedroom door to glimpse &lt;a href="http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/"&gt;Americans’ steamiest sex secrets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People enjoy sex and want to have sex; but they also want to know if  their wants, desires and needs are normal,” psychologist Ian Kerner,  author of “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/She-Comes-First-Thinking-Pleasuring/dp/0060538260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1286218633&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;She Comes First&lt;/a&gt;,” told AOL Health. “Although we live in a society that’s saturated in sexiness, we don’t know what others are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed 5,865 men and women between the ages of 14 and 94  regarding their sexual behaviors, patterns of condom use and the  percentage of Americans participating in same-sex encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

An important corollary is that resource limitations will limit population growth.  Thomas Malthus was perhaps the most influential proponent of this idea.

However, several factors complicate this story:

It was so much fun &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/09/the_new_nu_news.php"&gt;talking about neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; that I thought I'd take the time to tell you what all the fuss is about.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back -- &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; back -- to the late 1920s.  Not only did we know that everything on Earth was made out of atoms, we knew that atoms were made out of atomic nuclei, which were positively charged, massive, and tiny, and electrons, which were negatively charged, much less massive, and also tiny.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/neils-bohr-model-atom.gif" width="500" alt="neils-bohr-model-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even had some idea of how the energy levels worked (above) thanks to Niels Bohr, and how radioactive decay worked (below), thanks to Marie Curie, among others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/decay.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/decay-thumb-500x467-56583.jpeg" width="500" height="467" alt="decay.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a problem, however, with &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of these radioactive decays.  Specifically, the ones that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"&gt;underwent Beta Decay&lt;/a&gt; in the image above.  What's the problem?  It looked like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy"&gt;the conservation of energy&lt;/a&gt; didn't work for them!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hang on, you say.  I know what the conservation of energy says: that energy can't be created or destroyed, but &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be converted from one form into another!  Even mass, if Einstein's got it right, is just a form of energy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Taipei_101-e%3Dmc2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Taipei_101-e%3Dmc2-thumb-500x653-56585.jpeg" width="500" height="653" alt="Taipei_101-e=mc2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what &lt;b&gt;E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tells us, after all!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do I mean that the conservation of energy didn't work?  Let's give you one of the simplest examples: &lt;b&gt;tritium&lt;/b&gt;.  Nearly all of the hydrogen that exists in the Universe is the simplest atom you can imagine: one proton for the nucleus, and one electron orbiting it.  But I can make a hydrogen atom with a proton and a neutron for the nucleus, called deuterium, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; I can make it with a proton and &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; neutrons, called tritium.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/800px-Hydrogen_Deuterium_Tritium_Nuclei_Schmatic-de.svg.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/800px-Hydrogen_Deuterium_Tritium_Nuclei_Schmatic-de.svg-thumb-500x250-56588.png" width="500" height="250" alt="800px-Hydrogen_Deuterium_Tritium_Nuclei_Schmatic-de.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Apparently, wasserstoff -- "water-substance" -- is hydrogen in German.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while plain, no-neutron hydrogen and rare, one-neutron deuterium are stable, tritium, with its two neutrons, will decay after about 12 years!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/tritium_decay.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/tritium_decay-thumb-500x216-56590.gif" width="500" height="216" alt="tritium_decay.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big deal, you say.  All you have to do is -- if energy and momentum are conserved -- measure the mass of tritium, of Helium-3 and the beta particle (electron), and then you'll know how much &lt;i&gt;Kinetic Energy&lt;/i&gt; the electron ought to have.  And that should be easy to measure; it should come out with the same energy every time!  How much energy?  Just a little bit over 18 keV.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when we measure the energy of the electron, what do we see?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/neutrino003.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/neutrino003-thumb-500x274-56592.jpeg" width="500" height="274" alt="neutrino003.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a teeny, tiny fraction of them have around 18 keV of energy, &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; up to the expected amount, but not quite.  But the vast majority of these emitted beta particles have much, &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; lower energies.  How do you fix this problem?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/432920485_a81a64e166_o.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/432920485_a81a64e166_o-thumb-500x371-56594.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="432920485_a81a64e166_o.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Niels Bohr, if you asked him, put forth the idea that maybe energy &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; really conserved for all decays.  Maybe, whenever you have beta decay, you lose just a little bit of energy, and the stuff you start with has more overall energy than the stuff you wind up with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Wolfgang%20Pauli%2C%20Werner%20Heisenberg%20and%20Enrico%20Fermi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Wolfgang%20Pauli%2C%20Werner%20Heisenberg%20and%20Enrico%20Fermi-thumb-500x350-56596.jpeg" width="500" height="350" alt="Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg and Enrico Fermi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you asked Wolfgang Pauli (left, in the above photo, with Heisenberg and Fermi), he had a bold new idea.  Maybe, he postulated, energy and momentum really &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; conserved, but we just weren't seeing all the particles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, in addition to the helium-3 nucleus and the electron, there was a little, uncharged, neutral particle that was carrying away the missing energy and momentum.  He named it "neutrino", for "little neutral guy", and this was in 1930.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/537_1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/537_1-thumb-500x428-56600.jpeg" width="500" height="428" alt="537_1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear and particle physics developed a lot over the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s with the discovery of the neutron, the advent of the atomic bomb, the Hydrogen bomb, and the construction of the first nuclear power plants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/nuclear-power-plant.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/nuclear-power-plant-thumb-500x396-56598.jpeg" width="500" height="396" alt="nuclear-power-plant.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here's the thing.  Nuclear power plants work by taking radioactive Uranium rods, sticking them in water, where -- in addition to being enriched to make fissionable materials -- the Uranium radioactively decays, through a great chain of events, eventually culminating in stable lead.  Along the way, every time there's a beta decay, an atom produces one of these theoretical neutrinos (well, technically antineutrinos) of moderately high energies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/350px-Decay_chain%284n%2B2%2C_Uranium_series%29.png" width="350" height="458" alt="350px-Decay_chain(4n+2,_Uranium_series).png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the deal, and this is interesting.  If I can take tritium, and have it radioactively decay to form helium-3, an electron, and an antineutrino, I can make the &lt;i&gt;reverse happen&lt;/i&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the reverse?  Take one of these high-energy antineutrinos and smack it into helium-3!  What do I get out?  An atom of tritium -- which is hard to find -- and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"&gt;positron&lt;/a&gt;, which is easy to find!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why so easy?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Feynman_Diagram_of_Electron-Positron_Annihilation_v2.png" width="500" alt="Feynman_Diagram_of_Electron-Positron_Annihilation_v2.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because matter is full of electrons, the anti-particle of positrons.  When an electron and a positron collide, they produce two photons of the same energy that the mass of an electron (or positron) has: 511 keV!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, other things make these photons, too.  That's why you run the experiment twice: once near the nuclear power plant (which gives you the antineutrinos), and you get something like 500 reactions, and once far away from the nuclear power plant, and you only get something like 200!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Fred%20Reines%20and%20Clyde%20Cowan.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino/Fred%20Reines%20and%20Clyde%20Cowan-thumb-500x382-56604.jpeg" width="500" height="382" alt="Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's how you discover the neutrino!  Despite being proposed in 1930, it wasn't found until 1956, by Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan, who used &lt;a href="http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/news/nuexpt.html"&gt;Cadmium-Chloride instead of Helium-3&lt;/a&gt;, but the underlying physics is the same.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did Pauli win a Nobel Prize for this, Enrico Fermi, who worked out the reaction rates and cross-sections for neutrinos, also won one, and so did Reines and Cowan, who used Fermi's work to design their experiment!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's all it takes to discover a new particle!  And an experiment like this demonstrates, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that neutrinos exist.  Finally, you, too, know how to prove that neutrinos exist!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/10/the_story_of_the_neutrino.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286323286777"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=5304">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0395593959e437be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random"/><category term="bra"/><category term="frustrations"/><category term="life"/><title type="html">Things I’ve learned</title><published>2010-10-06T00:00:42Z</published><updated>2010-10-06T00:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/things-ive-learned-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:250px"&gt;&lt;img title="Bug Girl, Checking the silo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4022/4360239230_f6e9eb0df2_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bug Girl checking the silo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I live on-site at my job. This is wonderful, because I get to live in a beautiful place I could never afford otherwise. And, heat is included in my rent, which is important for a North Carolina transplant in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I didn’t know when I decided to live here was that without fail, &lt;em&gt;every damn time&lt;/em&gt; I wash my bras and string them up around the apartment on a drying rack with other lacy lingerie and underpants, &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is when my co-workers from physical plant will decide to show up and finally fix my broken pipe, or some other long neglected maintenance item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/10/05/sweden.nobel.medicine/"&gt;&lt;img title="t1larg.edwards.afp.gi" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/t1larg-edwards-afp-gi.jpg?w=536&amp;amp;h=301" alt="" width="536" height="301"&gt;Dr. Edwards and his wife (left) along with Louise Brown, the first “test tube baby”, and her son.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, we have learned a huge number of fundamental things concerning human reproduction &amp;amp; fertility.  Most people would call that progress, but not the Vatican…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/10/05/sweden.nobel.medicine/"&gt;Vatican official criticizes award of Nobel Prize to Robert Edwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official with the Vatican criticized the decision to award the  Nobel prize for medicine to British doctor Robert G. Edwards for his  work on in vitro fertilization, Italy’s official news agency ANSA  reported Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignazio Carrasco de Paula, president of the  Pontifical Academy for Life, said giving the award to Edwards was  “completely inappropriate,” according to the news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Edwards’ work had created a market for human eggs and created problems of embryos being frozen, the news agency said. …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the Vatican has decided to butt heads with the forces of progress &amp;amp; medical science on this one, even though IVF is widely accepted in society.  What’s the big deal?  Humans generated through this artificial process of procreation are just as human as the rest of us who came about the old fashioned way.  Is the Vatican harboring some secret fear of Frankenstein’s monster or something equally silly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that really bugs me about this pronouncement from the Vatican is not that they don’t approve of IVF – hell, no one is making their followers undergo IVF procedures – but that if they had their way, they’d outlaw IVF for everyone else.  And, while they’re at it, they would also probably like to do away with all birth control, since they seem to have a really big hangup about anything having to do with sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic, seeing as how the Roman Catholic Church is run by a bunch of men who don’t know the first thing about sex… with adults, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a third common garden species, the fast woodlouse, Philoscia muscorum. As it name implies, it is quite fast, with long legs that keep its body well above the ground. Its dark, rounded head, and a longitudinal dark stripe along its shiny, marbled body, make it easy to identify (for a simple key to ID British woodlice click here). The fast woodlouse is a native European species which is also found in the U.S. It is of medium size (around 1 cm.) and inhabits a range of habitats from sand dunes to woodland. A P. muscorum population living in the dunes of Spurn Head investigated by Grundy and Sutton showed the phenomenon of year-class splitting. This means that there are two reproductive strategies amongst individuals born each particular season. The &amp;#39;fast growers&amp;#39; reproduce when they are one year old and die, the &amp;#39;slow growers&amp;#39; breed for the first and only time when they are in their second year.Figure from Grundy and Sutton 1989. Note that the dark (slow) growers are joined in their second year by a new cohort (in grey).Grundy and Sutton&amp;#39;s experiments showed that females only reproduced with they reach large size and they have one or two broods (rarely three) with an interbrood period of 5.4 weeks. This and the positive relationship between temperature and growth rate means that most individuals born in the first brood are able to reach a large size before winter sets in and start growing faster when the breeding season arrives. Most individuals born in the second brood (a bit more than a month later) miss out on the benign growing conditions and are too small after the winter and when the next breeding season arrives they are still too small and waiting until the following breeding period makes sense to maximize their chances of reproducing successfully.More informationGrundy, A. &amp;amp; Sutton, S.

&lt;p&gt;Another day, yet another “God” lawsuit thrown out due to lack of standing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/"&gt;The Freedom from Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; sued the &lt;a href="http://www.aoc.gov/index.cfm"&gt;Architect of the Capitol&lt;/a&gt; in federal court to get the “In God We Trust” and Pledge of Allegiance engravings removed from the&lt;a href="http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/"&gt; Capitol Visitor Center &lt;/a&gt;in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/06/11/the-michael-newdow-case-standing-under-the-law/"&gt;my last article &lt;/a&gt; on Newdow’s struggle to get “so help me God” taken out of the presidential oath, this case was thrown out on an unfortunate, though needed, procedural technicality.  Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20101002/challenge-against-in-god-we-trust-display-thrown-out/"&gt;the case was tossed&lt;/a&gt; for lack of standing -– because providing the taxes to pay for the building isn’t enough — FFRF had failed to show that it had been or would be injured by the existence of the engravings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge in this case didn’t rule on the merits, but I will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, this lawsuit is premature.  Say what you want about references to God in our nation’s government documents, but at issue in this case is a depiction of an established (though, yes, extremely offensive) mainstay of America.  The engravings reflect the current state of our national motto, &lt;a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/currency/in-god-we-trust.shtml"&gt;our money&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance"&gt;our pledge&lt;/a&gt;.  FFRF and others should wait until they have successfully eliminated God from the pledge and money before going after the folks who chiseled it into a wall.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it doesn’t seem like lawsuits that get to the root of the problem ever do any good, there are victories.  One success I know of — because my mother was directly involved with the issue — happened in 2004 when the Los Angeles County seal was redesigned to remove a cross representing LA’s history with Catholic missionaries.  They also removed a depiction of a pagan goddess.  You can read about that &lt;a href="http://www.laalmanac.com/government/gl05.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://www.markdroberts.com/htmfiles/resources/crosscontroversy.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep up the fight, FFRF, just keep your priorities in order.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Children of a parent with bipolar disorder have increased rates of emotional disorder above and beyond the mood disorder category. This group of children also was found to have increased risk for an anxiety disorder, substance use disorders, ADHD and other disruptive behavior disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder.  Since many of these disorders occur before the typical age of onset of bipolar disorder, they may signal a higher risk for later onset of bipolar disorder.  These children also demonstrated high rates of a temperament type characterized by disinhibition—a tendency to take risks in novel environmental settings. Identifying risk factors for bipolar disorder in this high risk sample requires controlling for effects of diagnostic comorbidity in parents and controlling for the potential effects of medication use.  Parental anxiety disorders and substance use disorders increase risk for substance in the high-risk children.  Children developing bipolar disorder show neuropsychological impairments found in adult bipolar populations including deficits in executive function (planning, organization, multi-stage goal directed behavior), working memory, attention, mathematical skills and verbal memory.   However, many of these cognitive problems may be attributable to ADHD or worsened by the co-occurence of ADHD.  Examining the role of medication, the Harvard group found a link between mood stabilizer drug use (i.e. lithium and valproate) and slowed cognitive processing.  Some of the neuropsychological deficits found in children with bipolar disorder are also present in their siblings who do not yet meet criteria for a bipolar disorder diagnosis.  Neuroimaging studies in this high-risk child and adolescent sample suggests reduced glutamine and myoinositol in the anterior cingulate cortex.  This suggests reduction in brain glial cells in this brain region.  Unaffected sibs and those with partial symptoms show higher anterior cingulate glutamine, possibly a protective factor for the full expression of the disorder.Dr. Henin concluded her presentation with a brief summary of a psychotherapy model to treat adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder.  This program combines cognitive behavior therapy with elements of motivational interviewing to reduce the frequency of problem behaviors.  The study is ongoing but preliminary findings support the intervention as more effective than wait list in overall improvement and reducing risk behavior frequency.  Given the high number of concurrent other emotional disorders in bipolar high-risk children, diagnosis is a complex process.  Often longitudinal follow-up, symptom monitoring, assessing response to drug therapy and using a family members perspectives are required for accurate diagnosis.  Additional research is necessary to aid clinicians in the diagnostic process and to inform improved treatment and prevention strategies. Photo of U.S. Ryder Cup golfer Hunter Mahan (Camillo Villegas in backgroung) at 2010 PGA Championship.Henin A, Biederman J, Mick E, Sachs GS, Hirshfeld-Becker DR, Siegel RS, McMurrich S, Grandin L, &amp;amp; Nierenberg AA (2005).

Edwards "for the development of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization". They should have added "in humans."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a technological achievement, one that was based on years of work with other animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not favor awarding Nobel Prizes for technology. I prefer to give the science prizes to those who have advanced our fundamental understanding of the universe. This prize is for medicine, which is technology, so it doesn't violate any rules. But in the past the prize in Physiology or Medicine has usually been for basic research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It worries me that there may have been non-scientific motives behind this year's selection. We saw a horrid example of that last year when the Nobel Peace Prize was announced and I hope this isn't a trend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's an example of how the award is being treated in the press [&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8040955/British-IVF-pioneer-Robert-Edwards-gets-Nobel-Prize.html"&gt;British IVF pioneer Robert Edwards gets Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;As well as leading to a host of new treatments for infertility, the work also founded the principles behind stem cell research, cloning and techniques that would allow couples to prevent passing on inheritable diseases to their children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christer Höög, professor of molecular biology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and a member of the Nobel Prize Committee, said the birth represented a "paradigm shift"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It showed for the first time that it is possible to treat infertility," he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prof Edwards' work was highly controversial at the time and there was strong opposition to what was seen as 'playing God' and the research had to be privately funded. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The good news is that the Vatican is really, really, pissed! [&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11472753"&gt;Vatican official criticises Nobel win for IVF pioneer&lt;/a&gt;].

One example (due to Bill Wang via Tan Lee):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so  [mat1 je5] ry [aa3]&lt;br&gt;
so  乜野  ry  啊&lt;br&gt;
Why say sorry ?  [Usually in an angry and unpleasant mood]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the syllables of the English word are re-analyzed as if they were the monosyllabic quasi-morphemes of a Cantonese polysyllabic word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two syllables mat1 je3 are often merged and become me1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorry   -&amp;gt;  so  [me1] ry [aa3]&lt;/p&gt;

The first is that the IDiots never have anything positive to offer by way of explanation. They complain about how evolution can never do this or that but they never give us a better explanation based on their beliefs. The second problem is that the IDiots often get their science wrong when they complain about evolution. Sometimes this is deliberate, but in many cases it's because they just don't understand what they're criticizing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their criticisms of evolution are based on the notion of a false dichotomy. They think that there are only two choices: their conception of evolution, or Intelligent Design Creationism. Thus, if they can refute their version of evolution it follows that creationism must be true.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People often make the claim that Intelligent Design Creationism isn't science. That may be true if you only think of it as promoting the idea of an intelligent designer but even there it depends on how you define science. However, much of the Intelligent Design Creationism literature isn't about defending creationism, it's about attacking evolution and those arguments definitely fall within the definition of science. As scientists, we have to deal with all the objections to evolution no matter what the motives of the challengers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it's somewhat simplistic to dismiss all the Intelligent Design Creationist literature on the grounds that it's not science. Some of it has all the earmarks of science, it's just &lt;u&gt;bad&lt;/u&gt; science. And bad science isn't limited to IDiots. I think there are many Theistic Evolutionists who are also guilty of promoting bad science and there are many atheist scientists who are just as guilty. The peer-reviewed scientific literature is full of examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although it makes my American friends cringe, I favor teaching the controversy. It's the only way to show students the difference between good science and bad science.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the Intelligent Design Creationists can craft pretty convincing arguments against evolution. It takes a lot of work to refute them. I going to give you an example of such an argument from &lt;i&gt;The Edge of Evolution&lt;/i&gt; by Michael Behe. Let's see how you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="300&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Two Binding Sites Rule&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Behe&amp;#39;s version of the history of life requires a God who intervenes quite frequently to create specific mutations that are almost impossible to account for by random mutation. Behe makes a good case for the problems with random mutation. In fact, his arguments are similar to those put forth by the mutationist camp—a group that I&amp;#39;m in sympathy with. Most biologists would not be able to refute Behe&amp;#39;s arguments because they would agree with some of his false premises.&lt;br&gt;      &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKt4CBr5LmI/AAAAAAAAKyQ/01nHANzTniY/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:195px;height:400px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKt4CBr5LmI/AAAAAAAAKyQ/01nHANzTniY/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Behe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Two Binding Sites Rule&amp;quot; is a good example. He argues that in order for two proteins to interact, evolution needs to create a small patch on the surface of each protein where five or six amino acid side chains become compatible with binding. Some of these changes could be neutral so they could arise independently but the analysis of hundreds of known binding sites shows that many of the mutations would be detrimental if they occurred by themselves—a single charged amino acid residue on the surface, for example.&lt;br&gt;      &lt;br&gt;It looks like you need to wait for three or four specific mutations to occur simultaneously in order to get a moderate interaction between two proteins that did not originally bind to each other. And these can't be just any proteins, they have to be proteins where there is a selective advantage to forming a complex. The example I've chosen is a bacterial photosynthesis reaction center where four polypeptides (gold, blue, green, purple) interact with each other and with multiple cofactors (space-filling molecules) to form a very complicated structure. Presumably, there was a time in the past when some of these proteins didn't bind to each other or to the cofactors. Over time, evolution favored variants that could form the complex. How could this happen according to evolutionary theory?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Studies on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis show that the probability of forming any &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; binding site is very low. For example, it's quite difficult to engineer specific antibodies that will bind to a particular antigen. The data shows us that you need a library of more than one billion antibody molecules in order to get one that will bind. Those one billion mutations are far from random. They are engineered so that they are confined to a small patch on the surface of the antibody where it is known that other proteins can potentially bind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behe argues from this evidence that the probability of creating a new binding site by random mutations is exceedingly small. So small, in fact, that such mutations would only arise in very large populations after several hundred million years of evolution. He bases his argument on some experiments he describes in the first few chapters or his book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behe points out that it is sometimes very difficult for the malaria-causing parasite, &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, to develop resistance to some drugs used to treat malaria. That's because the resistance gene has to acquire &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; specific mutations in order to become resistant. A single mutation does not confer resistance and, in many cases, the single mutation is actually detrimental. &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; can become resistant because the population of these single-cell organisms is huge and they reproduce rapidly. Thus, even though the probability of a double mutation is low it will still happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the probability of a single mutation is about 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; per generation then the probability of a double mutation is 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt;. He refers to this kind of double mutation as CCC, for "chloroquine-complexity cluster," named after mutation to chloroquine resistance in &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Behe's calculation is correct. If two simultaneous are required then the probability will, indeed, be close to 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's see how this relates to the evolution of protein-protein interactions. Here's how Behe describes it on page 135 of his book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now suppose that, in order to acquire some new, useful property, not just one but &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; new protein-binding sites had to develop. A CCC requires, on average, 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, a hundred billion billion, organisms—more than the number of mammals that has ever existed on earth. So if other things were equal, the likelihood of getting two new binding sites would be what we called in Chapter 3 a &amp;quot;double CCC&amp;quot;—the square of a CCC, or one in ten to the fortieth power. Since that&amp;#39;s more cells than likely have ever existed on earth, such an event would not be expected to have happened by Darwinian processes in the history of the world. Admittedly, statistics are all about averages, so some freak event like this &lt;u&gt;might&lt;/u&gt; happen—it&amp;#39;s not ruled out by the force of logic. But it&amp;#39;s not biologically reasonable to expect it, or less likely events that occurred in the common descent of life on earth. In short, complexes of just three or more different proteins are beyond the edge of evolution. They are lost in shape space.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;We're all pretty knowledgeable here but how many of you can immediately refute that argument? If you can't then you have no business accusing Behe of being stupid or silly and of dismissing his book as just another example of creationist ignorance. The correct explanation of the problem will undoubtedly appear soon in the comments. Before peeking, why not try and see how you would answer Behe if you were debating him in front of a large audience of creationists?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Behe may have been wrong about the specific chloroquine resistance mutation he used as an example. The two mutations may not have occurred simultaneously. Nevertheless, the principle is sound. If the single mutations are detrimental then you need both to get resistance and the probablity of two such mutations occurring together is 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-2002955664607832885?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286306845123"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=44229">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3e201854634d4a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="energy"/><category term="SuperFreakonomics"/><title type="html">Harnessing the Volcano</title><published>2010-10-05T19:00:33Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T19:00:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/harnessing-the-volcano/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Here's an energy source you probably haven't thought about: volcanoes.

We spent a few minutes debating what kind of creature it might be; apatosaur, brontosaur (and was that even an actual dinosaur?), the Loch Ness Monster, plesiosaur…eventually our conversation shifted, but my friend did some research later in the week and sent me &lt;a href="http://www.lakecreature.com/"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it’s something of an art project:  A joint venture between a local artist and the Minneapolis Parks Foundation.  “Minne” is a fantastical lake monster, who spends time in various lakes around Minneapolis during the summer, and people can then visit the website to share their experiences seeing her, and write stories about her.  Cute, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I have to admit to being a bit disappointed when I learned she wasn’t actually a dinosaur.  I know.  Grumpy, jaded, no-good, meanie skeptic needs to get a sense of humor, and maybe some whimsy.  But how bloody cool would it be if it was a realistic life-size model of a plesiosaur?  The artist has interesting ideas about taking art outside the confines of art museums.  Why not add a little bit of science to the mix?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to get up on my high horse and argue that fantasy has no place in the public imagination.  I definitely appreciate this as a public art project.  But I can’t help lamenting the absent possibilities.  As it is now, the project is about wonder.  It is about injecting a little bit of magic into the mundane; a wonderful goal, in my opinion.  But why use a fantasy creature?  Why not use something that has actually existed, and allow people to imagine the real world, transported tens of million of years into the past?  I just don’t see any need for mystery mongering when we have such a rich natural history to draw upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I’m biased.  To me, the awesomeness of this world far surpasses anything that can be made up.  So for me, “Minne” is more a cheesy gimmick than an inspiration.  If that makes me a curmudgeon, well, I guess I’m okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Is this worthy of my disappointment?  Have you encountered similar projects in you hometown?  How have you reacted to them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286305136754"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/michael_shermer_coming_to_minn.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9f996029b43c656</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Michael Shermer coming to Minneapolis</title><published>2010-10-05T19:27:55Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T19:27:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/589t0lzde3Q/michael_shermer_coming_to_minn.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/michael_shermer_coming_to_minn.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, don't miss this: &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=127719457280141"&gt;Shermer will be speaking at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities&lt;/a&gt; next week, 14 October, at 7pm in Willey 175 (West Bank).

&lt;p&gt;Fall means foliage, and the province of Ontario is teeming with all the brilliant reds, oranges, and yellows leaf-peepers desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our many pristine places to &lt;a href="http://www.ontariotravel.net/TCISSegmentsWeb/gc/FD?language=en&amp;amp;_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_nfls=false"&gt;view fall’s brightest colors&lt;/a&gt; is Algonquin Provincial Park, located in south-central Ontario. Daily during autumn, Aspens, Red Oaks, Tamaracks, and Sugar and Red Maples perform their spectacular outdoor show covering 2,946 sprawling square miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikers and bikers alike will love traversing among our impressive fall color explosions, while other visitors will enjoy camping, backcountry canoeing, and fishing for brook or lake trout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Peters-Woods2" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/09/Peters-Woods2.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="349"&gt;But as you’re gazing up at our dazzling leaves, don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled for bull moose, deer, migrating birds, and black bears. (Just don’t get too close!) Intrepid campers may want to try howling for wolves during our cool autumn evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall season, let us introduce you to the many beautiful, changing colors of Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell you enough how cool that was, and at some point I’ll have to blog about the whole story; prepping for it, the night before when I was soaking in my hotel’s hot tub trying not to be terrified, walking to the grocery store next door to grab some dinner and seeing planes flying overhead at hundreds of kph, drinking about three liters of water and nearly blowing my bladder out while we drove to Nellis Air Force Base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more videos on the Discovery Channel’s &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/bad-universe-main/"&gt;main Bad Universe video list&lt;/a&gt;, and also just ones &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/bad-universe-alien-attack/"&gt;from Episode 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was just, to use the word without permission, "amazing."  The subjects would have their strength tested by holding out their arms and  resisting as best they could the downward pressure exerted by the color therapy "expert." When a blue colored card was placed in front  of the subjects, it was found they could resist the pressure quite well.  However when a pink colored card was used, their strength seemed to  abandon them. The same effect was found when their balance was tested.  It was all so convincing. But who was going to make money out of  something anyone could make for themselves at home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;Fast-forward  about thirty years or so and the color cards, as far as I know, are long  gone. But the same tests are still being used, only now they are employed sell a vast panopoly of products that use E.U.T.S. (Energies Unknown to Science)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;What a pity that science has not yet caught up with all these "bio-energy fields!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;As  you can see from the linked videos, all these companies use the same  balance, flexibility and strength “tests” to convince their customers of  the instant and profound effects of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;My  first encounter with these body “tests,” in the flesh, was at a Mind  Body Spirit (or “Mind Body Wallet” as we call it) festival in Sydney,  2008. A group of us came across the stand of FusionExcel as they  demonstrated the Quantum Pendant. Not one to be shy, I offered one of  the representatives the chance to be tested by Australian Skeptics for  our $100,000 prize – much the same thing as the JREF $1,000,000. To this  day I have not heard back. But what made the Quantum Pendant stand out  were the supplementary claims given by the FusionExcel representatives.  The pendant could also turn tap water into sun block. It might take a  moment for the gravity of this claim to sink in. A plastic pendant, if placed under a bottle of tap water for 15 minutes,  will give that water the power of a sunblock if rubbed on the skin. Indeed,  one of the representatives told us she used it on her grandchildren, as  she does not trust the chemicals in real sun block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;But  I digress. Let’s take a closer look at the so-called “tests” that help  sell all of these magical products. What is going on? To put it simply,  the person carrying out the “tests” slightly changes the direction of  applied force so as to either tip the subject off balance or to  reinforce the subject’s own balance. Look again at some of the videos  and you’ll see that is exactly what is going on. In order to illustrate  this point, I &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piu75P8sxTo"&gt;produced this video&lt;/a&gt; to clearly demonstrate the tricks. It also show how you too can invent your own science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;Apart  from these body tricks, (and don’t think for a moment that they aren't  convincing) once someone has it in their head that X, Y or Z product can  improve their strength or performance on the sporting field, there is  virtually nothing you can do to convince them otherwise. I met an  ex-footballer who told me that he didn’t care what I did or said, he  knew from personal experience that Power Balance worked. There are also  the seemingly endless financial possibilities that may just sway some to  jump on the bandwagon. A Power Balance band alone costs about $65 in  Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;My  own efforts in trying to enlighten people as to just how these tricks  are done seem to be paying off. In December 2009 I was asked by a  national TV news show to test Power Balance with the Australian  distributor, Tom O'Dowd. He failed 5 out of 5 tests with his own  product. This seemed to come as a complete surprise to him, as I suspect  he has never before been put to a double blind test. Whenever he or  anyone he knew “tested” the product, it was always an unblinded test -  meaning that it was fully known by the tester when a Power Balance was  being used and when it wasn't. Needless to say it did not take him long  to come up with an "out" that to him explained the Power Balance's  sudden failure.&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynbx5JfEwcA"&gt; The TV test can been seen here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;Despite  this bad publicity on national TV, the&lt;em&gt; Sydney Morning Heral&lt;/em&gt;d dated 8  September 8, 2010 &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F24wc54j&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHKksxRISbrDFDBbv3Ixu-W_d1wZg"&gt; reported that&lt;/a&gt; ”Many roll their eyes at the thought of  forking out $60 for a wristband that aims to improve balance and  flexibility. But not two Melbourne businessmen, whose Power Band  importing business is turning over millions of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;However,  due to this extra attention, the product came to the notice of&lt;em&gt; CHOICE  Magazin&lt;/em&gt;e, an independent Australian organisation dedicated to consumer  protection. After a series of tests with the Power Balance band, unknown  to skeptics and Power Balance alike, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F24k92df&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFxN9hBidMveTA9-9OHhwhsH4afRw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHOICE &lt;/em&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that "This  so-called exercise-assisting 'hologram' is nothing more than a pricey  placebo" and went even further in a&lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/2sd0p8/full"&gt; report in the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a “$2 shop scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;Brian Dunning has chimed in with a report on &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F2v44nka&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNErvwKdLDJsVBpTy7Z2p1FIwksCXA"&gt;the skepticblog&lt;/a&gt;, as has Travis Roy from the&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fy8a3nh5&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHiZ3JVnMu4jZV1h45VhPG_pO75nw"&gt; Granite State Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height:1.15;text-indent:0pt;direction:ltr"&gt;As  Skeptics we can do much to draw attention to such things as magical  bands that claim to improve well-being. But as &lt;em&gt;CHOICE&lt;/em&gt; points out, it is  up to our governments to act on these products and do what they were  elected to do and protect their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

(Soooooooo excited…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of the &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/"&gt;American Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt;, there’s now a way to make that day even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reserved space for a gathering of about 150 people at the &lt;a href="http://www.lauriolplaza.com"&gt;Lauriol Plaza Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just a short walk from the AHA offices and a few blocks away from the Dupont Circle Metro Station. The party starts at 4:00 p.m. — the rally/march is supposed to end at 3:00 — and there will be salsa.  How can you resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in joining us, the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=108025312595031"&gt;Facebook event page is here&lt;/a&gt;.  Spread the word!  (If you live in DC and want to join us, you’re welcome to, even if you’re not going to the rally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br&gt;

There may be times when you feel your wife or long-term girlfriend has been sleeping with another man. You may suspect she is even pregnant from this activity, and you are not the father. There is a way to fix this, using traditional medicines and some magic, so that your wife/girlfriend will have a spontaneous abortion if you are not the father of the child. You will need an ancient Canaanite or Hebrew priest to help mix up the concoction, and you have to go find The Lord himself  (Plan ahead! He is not always available!) to help out as well, but overall, the procedure is not that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve likely already seen this one on the cover of &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20101004,00.html"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt;, last weekend’s &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Groopman-t.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/health/2010/09/23/am.health.before.born.cnn"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does an expectant mother’s health and experiences during pregnancy influence her child through adulthood? A LOT! Paul explores factors like weight gain, stress, diet, disease resistance, environmental toxins, and more delving into the science behind how our months in the womb influence our lives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author and journalist Annie Murphy Paul ventures into  the laboratories of fetal researchers, interviews experts from around  the world, and delves into the rich history of ideas about how we’re  shaped before birth. She discovers dramatic stories: how individuals  gestated during the Nazi siege of Holland in World War II are still  feeling its consequences decades later; how pregnant women who  experienced the 9/11 attacks passed their trauma on to their offspring  in the womb; how a lab accident led to the discovery of a common  household chemical that can harm the developing fetus; how the study of a  century-old flu pandemic reveals the high personal and societal costs  of poor prenatal experience…With the intimacy of a personal memoir and the sweep of a scientific revolution, &lt;em&gt;Origins &lt;/em&gt;presents  a stunning new vision of our beginnings that will change the way you  think about yourself, your children, and human nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may already have heard of some of the studies included, never before  have they been compiled this comprehensive manner illustrating how they are related. Admittedly, &lt;em&gt;Origins&lt;/em&gt; may make a few expectant mothers (&lt;em&gt;my friends among them&lt;/em&gt;) extremely cautious–but that’s not a bad thing. Paul seamlessly combines the latest prenatal research with a compelling and relatable narrative that makes for excellent science writing and reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Then, about 10 years ago, we learned that neurogenesis does occur in the adult brain, but it was thought to be limited to two very small regions, the dentate gyrus and the sub-ventricular zone. Except in cases of injury, when adult neurogenesis had been reported elsewhere.Now Guo et al look set to overturn this orthodoxy in a new Journal of Neuroscience paper, as they found ongoing neurogenesis in healthy adult brains in an area called the piriform cortex, part of the cerebral cortex.The key to the discovery was oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs were previously believed to only be able to turn into cells called oligodendrocytes, which are not neurons, but glia; glia are a kind of support crew for the brain.But Guo et al show convincingly (with the help of genetically modified mice) that OPCs do become neurons in the piriform cortex of adult mice. Once they&amp;#39;ve been &amp;quot;born&amp;quot;, these new neurons mature into functional pyramidal cells - they form synapses with other neurons, and otherwise seem to be perfectly happy, and they survived for hundreds of days (i.e. most of a mouse&amp;#39;s lifetime).The methods they used are complex but the crucial result was that they observed pyramidal cells expression yellow fluorescent protein, in mice genetically modified to express this protein only in OPCs; the picture above this post is one of these &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot; (I know, it looks green to me) neurons.This isn&amp;#39;t the first paper to report neurogenesis in the adult mouse piriform cortex - a different group did so in 2008, but then two other experiments published later that year failed to confirm the result, so it&amp;#39;s remained controversial. Whether this will end the controversy is uncertain but it looks pretty solid to me.What does it all mean? The piriform cortex is a bit of a weird area, as while it&amp;#39;s part of the cerebral cortex, the most &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; part of the brain, it is evolutionary very old, and quite unlike the neocortex which is by far the largest part of the brain in humans.The piriform is involved in the sense of smell, which is very important for mice, not so much in humans. We do have a piriform cortex, but it&amp;#39;s tiny. Whether adult neurogenesis also occurs in the neocortex is the next big question...Guo F, Maeda Y, Ma J, Xu J, Horiuchi M, Miers L, Vaccarino F, &amp;amp; Pleasure D (2010).

But what if they don&amp;#39;t raise you kids quite right? Could brood parasite chicks raised by parents of another species grow up a bit ... confused? According to a recent study of brood-parasitic ducks, they can indeed [$a].

.flickr-photo { }.flickr-frameright { float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width:40%;}.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; }

 Redheads (above) sometimes lay eggs in the nests of canvasback ducks (below)—but redhead chicks raised by canvasbacks may not know what species they are. Photos by Nick Chill and meantux.The new study examines redheads, a species of North American duck which frequently lays its eggs in the nests of other duck species, particularly the canvasback duck, which occupies much of the same range. Redheads are facultative brood parasites—in years when conditions produce lots of resources, female redheads lay eggs in other ducks&amp;#39; nests as a supplement to their own nests; and in poorer years, they may lay only parasitic eggs [PDF]. Canvasback ducks, on the other hand, will lay eggs in the nests of other canvasbacks (which is not uncommon in birds [$a]), but don&amp;#39;t parasitize other species.

This sets up a nice behavioral experiment. In birds, species recognition may be due to varying degrees of nature and nurture—a male bird may recognize females of his own species by genetically-transmitted instinct, but he may also have to learn socially important songs or other behaviors from his parents and other adults. You might expect that redhead chicks have evolved to recognize their own species regardless of who raised them, while canvasbacks might be confused if they grow up around another species. 

So the authors experimentally transferred just-hatched male redhead chicks into canvasback broods, and male canvasback chicks into redhead broods, and compared their social development to male chicks raised by their own species. 

.flickr-photo { }.flickr-frameright { float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width:40%;}.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; }A female redhead spurns the advances of a cross-fostered male canvasback. Photo from Sorenson et al. (2010), figure 2.When the chicks had grown up, the authors offered the cross-fostered males access to females of both species, and recorded their interactions. It turned out that the brood parasitic rednecks were just as prone to species-confusion as the canvasbacks. Males of both species preferred to associate with females of the species with which they were raised, and directed almost all of their courting effort—displays of neck-arching and special calls—toward the species that fostered them. In fact, many of the cross-fostered males successfully formed mated pairs with females of the other species.

So why hasn&amp;#39;t redhead parasitism of canvasback nests broken down the reproductive isolation between these two species? The authors don&amp;#39;t have a clear answer, but note that the rate of observed hybrid couplings are much lower in natural populations than in their experimental setting. Social learning is a complicated thing, and life in larger, natural populations of the two species might not be well replicated in this study.

(&lt;b&gt;Edit:&lt;/b&gt; Mikko K. points out it was a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/07/sanchez_on_atheism.php#comment-2658080"&gt;commenter&lt;/a&gt; going by the handle AnswersInGenitals over at Jason Rosenhouse's blog.  Thanks!) So with &lt;s&gt;apologies&lt;/s&gt; due credit finally:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to properly frame the question, we must remember that, at this very moment, there are non-existent philosophers in a non-existent universe asking themselves why there is nothing rather than something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to get a more serious answer, I think we need to try rewording the question.  First attempt: "What caused there to be something rather than nothing?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that as we peel back the cosmological onion, it becomes difficult to meaningfully speak about "causes".  I recognize this is somewhat of an evasion, and it is admittedly a deeply unsatisfying answer.  But it may be the most technically accurate answer.  Take multiverse theory:  It may turn out to be ridiculous to try to apply the concept of cause-and-effect outside of any given universe -- in which case, asking "What caused the multiverse to exist?" would be one of those phrases that is syntactically correct but semantically meaningless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because this is so unsatisfying, let's try one more attempt at rewording the question: "What is the 'nothing' that caused there to be something?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ultimate Answer is below the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:white"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3516137416342275641?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286289579446"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/elder_packer_poll.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30cfb59fe1469fa2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Elder Packer poll</title><published>2010-10-05T14:53:52Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T14:53:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/2xWGeWXyyHQ/elder_packer_poll.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/elder_packer_poll.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By now, everyone knows that the &lt;a href="http://latterdaymainstreet.com/2010/10/03/will-this-hateful-rhetoric-continue-once-boyd-k-packer-has-passed-on/"&gt;hateful gerontocracy of the Mormon Church was on proud display by Boyd Packer&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the message of ignorance he's passing on, this video also reveals something we became familiar with in our years of living in Utah: the leadership of the church is really a collection of feeble-minded, doddering old fools, who frighteningly have an audience that thinks they're wonderful, no matter what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus there is one other vehicle: parked directly below the windows of the room where the faculty of the country's finest department of Linguistics and English Language hold their staff meetings is a large catering truck to provide lunch for the crew, and it is labeled &lt;b&gt;DeluxDiner's&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that owns it is called DeluxDiners.  They have a website at &lt;a href="http://www.deluxdiners.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.deluxdiners.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see from that page, the company name is a &lt;b&gt;regular plural&lt;/b&gt;. There is no trace of an apostrophe in the web page text.  But there is a photograph of one of their lunch trucks, with the offending apostrophe up there in red.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My department is in an uproar.  Older members are pacing the corridor muttering to themselves and brandishing copies of &lt;i&gt;Fowler's Modern English Usage&lt;/i&gt; (I don't know why they do that brandishing thing). Younger members are planning sit-ins or worse. American members of the faculty (we have quite a few) are cleaning their weapons.  (Firearms are just about totally forbidden in this country, so they do not have their revolvers, but they are oiling the bows and arrows they brought over.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is going to be trouble here.  The BBC have paid the university for a quiet day of unimpeded control over our roof terrace, to film several scenes of some drama (I don't know what, exactly); and that is all very well, but we did not expect them to bring in this orthographic scandal, this brightly colored monstrosity of grammatical uncouthness, this mobile lunchroom of illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone recently told me that the diner truck is actually subcontracted to a company called KoCo, which is a subsidiary of Shed Media Scotland, which is part of the Shed Media Group, which was recently sold to Time Warner. So it may be Time Warner that should be protested against, and not the BBC at all.  I don't know.  But what I do know is that sooner or later some hothead is going to seize the moment and the doors to that roof terrace are going to burst open during a shoot and an army of linguists and English language specialists are going to rush out there and stage a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question for me is, as a responsible head of department should I try to prevent it?  Or as a grammarian, &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;documenter of Standard English&lt;/a&gt;, and defender of  educational standards, should I join in the demonstration? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to watch the TV news to find out which way my conscience finally led me.  Either way there could be (indeed, probably will be) bad press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it be &lt;b&gt;Simon Heffer and Lynne Truss Attack "Liberal" Grammar Prof Over BBC Lunch Van Typo: University Threatens Dismissal&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;b&gt;Language Log Writer Held on Public Disorder Charge After Edinburgh Apostrophe Riot, University Threatens Dismissal&lt;/b&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;

One particularly popular violator of science is Deepak Chopra, who routinely spouts nonsense to millions of people. He uses scientific words in his sentences, but in such a way that their meaning is either lost or twisted beyond any real sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptic Michael Shermer &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/09/21/is-god-a-nonlocal-quantum-mind/"&gt;has written another article blasting Chopra&lt;/a&gt;, deservedly, IMO. Chopra routinely abuses quantum mechanics to bolster his claims about mysticism and God. To people unfamiliar with science his claims may sound deep, but in fact to those of us who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; grok QM we can see right through the babble. Shermer does a great job showing that all Chopra is doing is rehashing age-old concepts with new terms, saying nothing really new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the more you try to pin Deepak down, the more drivel he writes on HuffPo and other piffle purveyors. In that sense, at least, there’s &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; quantum mechanics at play.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's do a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've encountered that very silly man, Barney Zwartz, a few times before. He's an Australian columnist who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/bad_bad_media.php"&gt;whined incompetently about the Global Atheist Convention in Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, and thinks &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/the_clown_shoe_still_capers.php"&gt;"militant atheist" literally means they are coming in jackboots to crush believers&lt;/a&gt; (he also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/the_clown_shoe_still_capers.php#comment-2736687"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; in that thread). He's kind of a clueless dingleberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's also getting dumber. He's now &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/i-was-raised-from-dead-woman-tells-20101001-1614w.html"&gt;credulously reporting that a fundagelical kook is going about raising the dead&lt;/a&gt;. It's not just any kook, either, it's Danny Nalliah, an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/australias_current_afflictions.php"&gt;odious little creep who points to natural disasters and claims they're God's vengeance on people who don't support the conservative party line on abortion and such&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#39;s a cut-rate Australian Pat Robertson in that regard, only with less clout…except that people like Zwartz will gullibly hand him more authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/purepoison/2010/10/05/the-ages-barney-zwartz-like-reading-the-ctfm-newsletter/"&gt;Nalliah is acting as if Zwartz is his personal publicity agent&lt;/a&gt;. That should be a sign to The Age that it's time to let him go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavriel Avital was the chief scientist in the Israeli education ministry, emphasis on &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;. I called him the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/the_don_mcleroy_of_israel.php"&gt;Don McLeroy of Israel&lt;/a&gt;, a bumbling denialist who who rejected both the idea that humans evolved from other apes and that carbon dioxide contributed to global warming. Good news: &lt;a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3964117,00.html"&gt;Avital was fired&lt;/a&gt;, and even better news, he was fired for his stupid anti-science comments, rather than the usual route of getting fired for incompetence in other aspects of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Hallett is a totally powerless crackpot who believes he has found &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/another_entry_in_the_annals_of.php"&gt;fossil dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of fossil dragons. In fact, just about every rock he sees on the sere hillsides of Utah he imagines to be a bone from giant pre-Cambrian Seazorian monster from the Halletestoneion Era (←not a recognized geological division, as you might guess). The pathetic little man is totally delusional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he's vainly &lt;a href="http://community.fox13now.com/_Remove-State-Paleontologist-immediately/BLOG/2682075/96363.html"&gt;railing to have the Utah State Paleontologist fired&lt;/a&gt; for inadequately protecting his rocks. I&amp;#39;ve seen his photos; they&amp;#39;re random boulders, and Hallett sees Seazoria (another made-up category) dragons in their patterns like others might see squid in the clouds…but rational people know it takes more than imagination to document reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

There are parthenogenetic vertebrates (some of which have been featured on this blog), but the Mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is the only vertebrate that regularly self-fertilizes. Most individuals have male and female reproductive organs. Obviously, this allows you to have individuals that are not quite clones, but certainly have much more limited variation than most sexual species.

But, because sex is rarely simple, some individuals in this species are just male. 

And that little detail means that the hope that all these individuals will create nice, neat, clone lineages gets shot down. So Tatarenkov and colleagues decided to investigate how genetically similar these fish are to each other.

Some findings are depressingly familiar. Cell biologists have often found that what they thought was one type of cell cultures has been contaminated by nearby strains of other immortal cells. HeLa cells are particularly notorious in this regard. Similarly, Tatarenkov and company found about 20% of their marbled killifish did not have the expected genes. Incomplete record keeping meant that many sources of error, or sources of new variation they found, could not be traced back to its source.

They did find new genetic variation that appeared to have cropped up since the animals had been collected for the lab, which they attributed to new mutations. In fact, one gene seemed to be a mutational “hotspot,” mutating several times in different lines.

The major source of genetic variation, however, was the original source of the lab population. This fish has a wide distribution, and stocks collected from different locations did not resemble each other. Thus, this fish has a nice combination of being able to maintain genetic similarity within a lineage, but there remains some variation across lineages.

P.S. – If this fish’s specific name, “marmoratus,” looks a bit familiar, it’s because it is Latin for “marbled.” And that’s undoubtedly the same root for the word, “Marmorkrebs.”

The first post, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/09/28/communicating-about-climate-science-part-i/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, simply put up a &lt;a href="http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2010/09/27/dr-ben-santer-and-chris-mooney-on-communicating-climate-science/"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; about this topic from Climate Science Watch. The second post, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/09/30/communicating-about-climate-science-part-ii/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, addressed how important it is for climate scientists to be good communicators, and how scientists can protect themselves from being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s go on to some more important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Clearly, we have a large part of the public which doesn’t accept climate science. Is that who we should be trying to reach and convince? Or is it some other audience that should be targeted?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a critical question because it highlights that there are different subsets of the public, with different degrees of receptivity to mainstream climate science. In particular, the research by Anthony Leiserowitz at Yale University (and colleagues) has highlighted that there are &lt;a href="http://environment.yale.edu/uploads/SixAmericasJan2010.pdf"&gt;really 6 Americas&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to global warming, and those who are what Leiserowitz calls the “dismissive” (we might call them the deniers) are the least likely to be moved or persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the dismissives have been  growing dramatically of late, from 7 percent of the public in 2008 to 16 percent in 2010.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What climate scientists ought to be doing—and climate science communicators ought to be doing—is targeting segments of the public that are not dismissive, that can be reached, but that so far have been informationally disenfranchised. They haven’t been engaged, but there’s great potential there. However, you need to reach them with the right message, one that speaks to them and makes them care about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I think research and analysis by Matthew Nisbet of American University is really helpful. Because what Nisbet shows is that there are many different ways of communicating about climate science, and the particular “frame” that you choose has great implications for what kind of audience you’re capable of reaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 5 possible frames that I’m aware of—“scientific/technical,” “economic,” “ethical/religious,” “national security,” and “public health.” I don’t want to go into a ton of detail on each of them, because that would lead to a dramatically long blog post, and it has been &lt;a href="http://www.ametsoc.org/atmospolicy/documents/112806NisbetAMS.pdf"&gt;discussed elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the point to emphasize is that each frame has the potential to reach different audiences. E.g., a message about how addressing climate change will spur the growth of green jobs, and new innovative companies, is a message the investor class might listen to. And a message about how addressing climate change will help wean us off foreign oil, and prevent the destabilizing effects of mass ice sheet loss and the disintegration of low-lying countries like Bangladesh, can speak to those who care about our nation’s geopolitical standing and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4) Who speaks for climate science? Can they be full time communicators, or top scientists doing this work in their spare time? Must they have Ph.D’s to be credible? Or is that training actually a hindrance when it comes to navigating the media and communication sphere?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view, academia is far too full of technical experts, and far too devoid of expert communicators. I believe that scientists who are excellent communicators ought to be tenured on that basis, given sustainable careers, and encouraged to explore and innovate in communication techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that people who aren’t necessarily Ph.D.s themselves, but have shown great aptitude when it comes to communicating about scientific topics, should have the same kinds of opportunities available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the answer is not only that we ought to be developing science “translators,” but that we ought to be promoting and rewarding those who are good at it, within and as part of the traditional academic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give a great example. There’s an incredible YouTube video about climate change, “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zORv8wwiadQ"&gt;The Most Terrifying Video You’ll Ever See&lt;/a&gt;.” It has been seen by some 3.7 million or more people. It was made not by a scientist, but by a high school teacher in Oregon, a guy named &lt;a href="http://www.gregcraven.org/"&gt;Greg Craven&lt;/a&gt;. It is a tremendous way of getting across why we have to do something about climate change—because it is creative, unexpected, funny, and personality driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need innovative people like Greg Craven out there communicating climate research, even if they’re not Ph.D. scientists. They’re still a key part of the team. In fact, in many cases, they may be able to find new and innovative ways of communicating that are different from what scientists would be likely come up with–and Craven is a key case in point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the same individuals will scream at you if you even begin to discuss 2nd amendment issues.  Most of them think there is a privacy amendment and most of them prefer positions of appeasement over strict constitutionality ... when it is convenient. In other words, Minnesotans are much like the rest of America, but with more corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I do not expect the citizens of the North Star State to rise up in rebellion or even to get mildly indignant over the fact that the Minnesota Catholic Conference is engaging in clearly illegal campaign and political activities.  It is, after all, the church, what could they be dong wrong? Their heart is in the right place, so what if there's a gray area in this church-state separation thing?  I mean, churches do good work, don't they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odd that this should happen really, since I often get accused of not reading what the anti-vaxers have to say. This couldn’t be further from the truth. In additional to the tripe on the Facebook pages, the forums, the mailing lists and comments on news articles, I have perused the information pack for &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/01/19/i-object-to-this-reading-material/"&gt;conscientious objectors&lt;/a&gt;, flicked through Living Wisdom and looky over there &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a copy of Callous Disregard by Andrew Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more than I suspect they do with respect to research. Although, Meryl Dorey says she reads papers about vaccination but apparently comes away with completely different conclusions to the authors, making the exercise rather futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the recent HCCC investigation concluded that whilst the AVN may cite peer-reviewed research, they quote selectively from it, often in contradiction to the conclusions or findings of the studies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Dorey explained this discrepancy with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is true that oftentimes, our information will contradict the conclusions or summaries of the studies. This is because, as opposed to most doctors and government officials, we actually read the studies and frequently, the summary and conclusion does not agree with the raw data itself…..Many times, that disconnect can be explained by the financial links between the study’s researchers and the companies whose products are being studied. So, whilst the AVN does frequently draw different conclusions to those printed at the end of these articles, it is because our analysis of the data shows that the printed conclusions do not correspond with the raw data. This is not selective reporting – it is accurate reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw data. It doesn’t mean what you think it means Ms Dorey. And the financial links? Oh course, the old shill canard again. When you ‘aint got nothin’ else.. (and you don’t know &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/blog/the-truth-behind-the-avn-claims/"&gt;how to read papers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AVN have been in oodles of trouble lately, the most recent being for multiple breaches of copyright associated with selling material on their website without permission. Which is funny, because one of the things I came across in the information in Living Wisdom was their permission to reproduce policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;“Whilst reproduction and dissemination of the information found in Living Wisdom is actively encouraged (unless otherwise stated), it is &lt;strong&gt;expressly forbidden&lt;/strong&gt; for anyone to reproduce any of this information for the &lt;strong&gt;purpose of profit&lt;/strong&gt;…”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My emphasis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which directly contradicts the reason they were recently in strife – for selling other authors’ material on their website, without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/copyright-breaches-land-group-in-trouble-20100831-14fna.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from the Sydney Morning Herald describes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“an anti-vaccination group is under fire for allegedly breaching copyright laws by selling newspaper and medical journal articles online without permission from the authors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The packs, which were selling for up to $128, included home-made books filled with articles photocopied from journals around the world, information on drugs taken from MIMS, the medical guide used by doctors and nurses, and copies of brochures inserted in medication boxes by pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the Copyright Act, articles can be copied for personal research or for use by students but cannot be disseminated widely or sold.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Meryl said she was “unaware she had breached copyright”. This is despite the fact that she is listed as the editor of Living Wisdom and therefore probably wrote the policy. Even if she didn’t, one would think it is part of her job to understand copyright restrictions as the editor of a magazine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the duplicity of the AVN is something we have come to know well. This is a recent screen capture from their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="couple of years ago by scepdoll, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scepdoll/5054244022/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4105/5054244022_596a88c797.jpg" alt="couple of years ago" width="500" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it appears Meryl knew about some of these copyright rules “a couple of years ago” at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders if the authors contacted by the Sydney Morning Herald decided to take any action against the AVN given some might be owed a nice wad of booty. Based on the AVN’s permission to reproduce policy, they themselves would be joining a queue to recoup any lost funds. So what’s good for the goose is good for the gander right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, except when you’re a bunch of hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;

Kern of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;My dearest Dr. Kern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel as though I should begin my letter to you with a confession.  When I first read your &lt;a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/ethicsandscience/2010/10/01/more-is-better-received-widsom-in-the-tribe-of-science"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/sanitized/2010/09/30/the-passion-of-the-scientist"&gt;infamous&lt;/a&gt; opinion piece in Cancer Biology and Therapy called "&lt;a href="http://www.eurekah.com/journals/cbt/article/12994"&gt;Where's the Passion?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, I was not in the lab or in my office.  No, I was standing in my kitchen reading in between bursts of squirting whipped cream into my three year old&amp;#39;s open mouth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="whippedcream.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/whippedcream.JPG" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="320" height="240"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://franklinfamilybegins.blogspot.com/2008_08_01_archive.html"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: Not Little Isis, but still pretty freaking cute.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize from reading your editorial that you don&amp;#39;t fashion yourself a family man, so you&amp;#39;ll have to take my word for it that a three year old with a nose and mouth full of Redi Whip is about the cutest thing ever.  It&amp;#39;s even cuter than that&lt;a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/archive/tags/monkey/default.aspx"&gt; picture of a chimpanzee cuddling a tiger pup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, I digress.  I realized immediately upon reading the following words that I have been failing science...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[O]ff-site laypersons offer comments on my observations. "Don't the people with families have a right to a career in cancer research also?" I choose not to answer. How would I? Do the patients have a duty to provide this "right", perhaps by entering suspended animation?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dr. Kern, you are absolutely right.  Every moment that I spend filling my child&amp;#39;s mouth with whipped cream is a moment some other child is dying of cancer because I am not busy curing them.   And, until scientists invent suspended animation technology, which I think they could if they weren&amp;#39;t busy filling their own children&amp;#39;s mouths with whipped cream, I have a duty.  I mean, I could argue that it is really the suspended animation scientists that are falling down on the job, but we all deserve some of the blame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="suspended_animation.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/suspended_animation.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="246" height="260"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://technoccult.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/suspended_animation.jpg"&gt;FIgure 2: &lt;/a&gt; If only those suspended animation scientists would get it together.  If there was suspended animation, then perhaps Kern would reevaluate his claim that patients don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;duty&amp;quot; to enter it.  Would only seem fair to me...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You raise an incredibly important question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could "doused passion" be the major bottleneck impairing medical research? Or, to mix my metaphors: Is there an elephant in this building? If so, be careful as you pass. Move along, move along.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Reading your editorial, I felt inspired.  Not to mix my metaphors, but clearly the missing piece of the puzzle that would reveal the Holy Cancer Grail is passion.  After all, as you point out, two dudes once discovered the cures for two diseases.  Surely everyone else is a huge slacker.  AIDS researchers? Slackers.  ALS disease researchers?  Probably playing golf 25-30 hours a week.  Parkinsons?  You&amp;#39;d think we could have done something for Michael J. Fox by now.  After all, &lt;a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/29/michael-j-fox-on-parkinsons-and-life/"&gt;that dude's teeth aren't going to brush themselves&lt;/a&gt;.  If we could just grab all the scientists, give them a shake, and tell them to be passionate, I have no doubt we&amp;#39;d cure cancer in the next 18 months.  20 months tops.  Then we could move on to some other very important disease that makes you lose your hair.  Like, male pattern baldness.  I am really passionate about fixing that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I realized that I perhaps have made a grievous mistake.  A mistake that has cost millions of lives of little cancer-striken babies.  You see, I am not a cancer researcher.  Do I have a right to enter a field other than cancer research?  Do all of the cancer-striken people in this world, especially the adorable little babies with tumors, have a duty to provide me that &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; by entering suspended animation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn it, we return back to those lackadaisical suspended animation scientists again.  I wish someone would give them a kick in the ass to help them along.  Especially, since the ass is one of the many places you can get cancer.  I promise to find a postdoc tomorrow to retrain me as a cancer researcher.  I also promise to start doing the shameful job in the lab sink.  That should save me the 3 minutes a day I spend walking to and from the bathroom.  This saved time should allow us to shorten the cure for cancer to 19.75 months.  More tumor ridden babies saved!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I completely agree, Dr, Kern. As you point out, if we had scientists in cancer research who were passionate and driven, we could put an end to this terrible disease.  After reading your editiorial I am nothing if not driven.  We need to dispose of all the deadwood now!  The problem surely is laziness.  Anyone who might suggest that the current funding environment may play a role can choke on an enormous ass tumor.  Certainly faculty aren&amp;#39;t spending more time away from the laboratory, focused on grant writing, in a fight to keep their laboratories funded.  And this time away does not ever result in a leadership deficit.  Absent leadership does not beget absent trainees and technicians ever.  And, I definitely will not entertain the hypothesis that this may be a problem unique to your department and a subpopulation of old, get-offa-my-lawn era dudes who glorify the olden days when they worked at the bench next to Pasteur and helped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur_pipette"&gt;him name his pipette&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, we have cancer because scientists are lazy.  Anyone who disagrees should just get cancer and die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my best,&lt;br&gt;Isis the Scientist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/10/an_open_letter_33.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/iEXAJ_VlRMY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286280187345"><id gr:original-id="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce0018027b6dda32</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="dementia"/><category term="Vitamins"/><title type="html">More on B Vitamins and Dementia</title><published>2010-10-05T11:47:16Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T11:47:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2353" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2290"&gt;Last month I reported&lt;/a&gt; on a small study that purported to show that supplementation with the B-vitamins – B12, B6 and folate, were associated in a small study with a decrease in the amount of brain atrophy over a two year period. There were some problems with this study, but it is plausible that a subset of the population, if they are functionally low in one or more of these B vitamins, may neurologically benefit from correction through supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, and others, pointed out, however, that the study did not look at cognitive function, which is a more relevant clinical outcome. It only looked at brain atrophy as measured with an MRI scan, and it is not clear if the results are clinically significant. I suggested the need for further research with more clinically relevant outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I did not have to wait long. A couple of weeks later a &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/ford-b-vits-dementia-2010.pdf"&gt;study was published in Neurology by Ford et al&lt;/a&gt; that looked at cognitive function and risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here are the methods from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators recruited 299 community-representative hypertensive men 75 years and older to a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of folic acid, vitamin B6, and B12 supplementation vs placebo over 2 years. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). A secondary aim of the study was to determine if supplementation with vitamins decreased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia over 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were completely negative – no statistically significant effects on either cognitive function or on the risk of developing AD, at least in hypertensive men 75 and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this situation often in clinical research – apparently conflicting results depending on how you look at a question. In general, directly relevant clinical outcomes (like cognitive function and risk of AD) are considered to trump indirect outcome measures (like brain atrophy). You also have to consider the size of the study and the magnitude of the resultant effect.  Taking all this into account it seems that this more recent negative study has greater implications for the relationship between B-vitamin supplementation and dementia than does the prior positive study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had concluded that at present the research is inconclusive, but there is plausibility to benefit for B-vitamin supplementation, at least in a subset of people who are relatively deficient. Even after this more recent study this is still true, but this study makes it more likely that there may be no cognitive benefit to supplementation, and any potential benefit is likely to be modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still room for further research and I doubt this will be the last word on this particular question. But it does signal the need for caution before claiming any specific benefits for B-vitamins and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286280025240"><id gr:original-id="http://blog.joerg.heber.name/2010/10/05/great-the-physics-nobel-prize-for-graphene-now-dont-overhype-it/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fbadf478fe69e0f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Great, the physics Nobel prize for graphene!

We've seen it many times before. Indeed, we saw it just yesterday, when promoters of quackery and anti-vaccine cranks leapt all over the revelation that American scientists had intentionally infected Guatemalan prisoners with syphilis without their consent as part of an experiment in the 1940s. They didn't attack the story because it was an inexcusable and horrific violation of human rights; rather, they attacked it because they thought that they could use the story to discredit science-based medicine (SBM) and, if they could discredit SBM, then it would somehow constitute an argument that their pseudoscience and quackery are valid. We've seen this behavior many times before. Another example includes Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/thorsen_wakefield_fine_art_of_distraction.php"&gt;salivating over the Pol Thorsen scandal&lt;/a&gt;, even though Thorsen was a relatively minor figure in the Danish studies that demonstrated that thimerosal in vaccines is not associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I've vacillated between the view that this sort of behavior is either outright deceptive and that the pseudoscientists using it know what they're doing or that they genuinely believe what they're saying. In this latter case, the pseudoscience supporter or denialist seems to subscribe to a serious case of black-and-white thinking to the point where, if something is not perfect, then, as the sketch goes, it's crap. There's even a name for this fallacy, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/vaccines_the_fallacy_of_the_perfect_solu.php"&gt;Nirvana fallacy or the fallacy of the perfect solution&lt;/a&gt;. Of course inevitably there is a huge amount of selectivity in the application of the Nirvana fallacy. If it's science-based medicine and imperfect, it's crap, but if it's "alternative medicine," seemingly any flaw is excusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect example of this is a post on that wretched hive of pseudoscience and quackery, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, by the father of that other wretched hive of pseudoscience and quackery, so-called "functional medicine." Yes, I'm referring to Dr. Mark Hyman of &lt;a href="http://drhyman.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ultrawellness&lt;/a&gt;, whose graced both HuffPo and his own blog with &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/dangerous-spin-doctors-7-_b_747325.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Science for Sale: Protect Yourself From Medical Research Deception&lt;/a&gt; (the version on Dr. Hyman's on blog &lt;a href="http://drhyman.com/dangerous-spin-doctors-7-steps-to-protect-yourself-from-deception-2407/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). You'll see the Nirvana fallacy combined with a heapin' helpin' of pseudoscience and logical fallacies on display. Like a typical Mike Adams screed, it begins with a study that finds fault with evidence-based medicine (EBM):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/mark_hyman_deceives_about_science_resear.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/mark_hyman_deceives_about_science_resear.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/nXVQm-Lzzkk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286276532524"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=19803">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/824ff9ddbaa753bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="religion"/><title type="html">Is Francis Collins a deist?</title><published>2010-10-05T11:02:07Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T11:02:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/is-francis-collins-a-deist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Big Think&lt;/em&gt;, NIH director Francis Collins is interviewed about the science-religion divide.  Most of what he says in his interview, called “&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/24154"&gt;Why it’s so hard for scientists to believe in God&lt;/a&gt;,” is pretty standard accommodationism.  It’s rife with NOMA-ism, for instance, and with the idea that the two magisteria address different questions.  But it’s intriguing how Collins describes the questions that he sees as the unique bailiwick of faith.  I’ve put some sections in bold below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But faith in its perspective is really asking a different set of questions.  And that’s why I don’t think there needs to be a conflict here.  &lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kinds of questions that faith can help one address&lt;/strong&gt; are more in the philosophical realm.  Why are we all here?  Why is there something instead of nothing?  Is there a God?  Isn’t it clear that those aren’t scientific questions and that science doesn’t have much to say about them?  But you either have to say, well those are inappropriate questions and we can’t &lt;strong&gt;discuss them&lt;/strong&gt; or you have to say, we need something besides science &lt;strong&gt;to pursue some of the things that humans are curious about&lt;/strong&gt;.  For me, that makes perfect sense.  But I think for many scientists, particularly for those who have seen the shrill pronouncements from extreme views that threaten what they’re doing scientifically and feel therefore they can’t really include those thoughts into their own worldview, faith can be seen as an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that he doesn’t say that religion can &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; questions: it can “address” them and help us “discuss” them and “pursue” them.  I’m not sure whether this is deliberate evasion (I believe Karl Giberson takes the same tactic), but of course claiming that religion provides answers lays you open to queries about the different “answers” of other faiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strangest part of the interview is where Collins describes how he thinks God affects the universe. It verges on deism.  Again, I’ve put one part in bold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of our universe I think also for me as for Einstein raised questions about the possibility of intelligence behind all of this.  Why is it that, for instance, that the constance that determines the behavior of matter and energy, like the gravitational constant, for instance, have precisely the value that they have to in order for there to be any complexity at all in the Universe.  That is fairly breathtaking in its lack of probability of ever having happened. &lt;strong&gt; And it does make you think that a mind might have been involved in setting the stage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time that does not imply necessarily that that mind is controlling the specific manipulations of things that are going on in the natural world.  In fact, I would very much resist that idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I think the laws of nature potentially could be the product of a mind.  I think that’s a defensible perspective.  But once those laws are in place, then I think nature goes on and science has the chance to be able to perceive how that works and what its consequences are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this doesn’t &lt;em&gt;verge&lt;/em&gt; on deism: it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; deism. God set up the laws of physics and let things roll. But the curious thing is that if Collins really believes this, and “strongly resists” the idea that God manipulates what’s going on in the world by suspending natural laws, then he surely can’t believe in miracles.  And yet, as an evangelical Christian, his faith rests squarely on miracles. The virgin birth, the resurrection, the miracle stories of the New Testament—all of those would have to go out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that Collins has undergone a profound shift of faith, but I’d love to ask him how this apparent deism comports with his evangelical Christianity.  I’m sure these sentiments aren’t welcomed at &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt;, the organization he founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an amazing deal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, depending on the type of cookie, I’d be willing to exchange a few of my souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieSign.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieSign-550x367.jpg" alt="" title="SoulCookieSign" width="550" height="367"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieContract.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieContract-412x550.jpg" alt="" title="SoulCookieContract" width="412" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieCrowd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/SoulCookieCrowd-550x367.jpg" alt="" title="SoulCookieCrowd" width="550" height="367"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The point of this is not to antagonize people. We’re promoting critical thinking among various religious perspectives with students at Tech.” [public relations manager Austin] Fielding said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Stacks, a junior history major from Lewisville, is the activities director of the organization.  In the organization’s second year, her participation in International Blasphemy Day has a strong meaning and purpose for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now in the UN they are trying to pass a law to ban blasphemy,” Stacks said. “We’re out here for freedom of speech. We should be allowed to say whatever we want.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how many students took the idea of a soul so seriously that they wouldn’t just write it off for a cookie.  They had to take a few “precautions”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some Tech students were hesitant to sign because they believed it contradicted their religion. In order to make them more comfortable, the group had a light-hearted solution to assure the student they were not making any binding contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have people cross all of their toes, cross all of their fingers, cross their eyes, sign with their non-dominant hand and use fake names or fake signatures,” Fielding said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did they just add superstition to an already fictitious idea…?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*sigh* &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know they’re just joking, but the fact that the joke even needed to be made says something.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very simple.  Your soul was worth nothing before. It’s worth nothing now.  The sooner you figure this out, the sooner you can get a cookie.  (And isn’t that what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’d be nice if the message that souls don’t exist actually got through to some of the students… maybe they’ll even attending a future meeting of the secular student group.  The publicity stunt could have a tremendous benefit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To some extent, the life of an officer posted to such places could be measured in months. As well as diseases that affected people there were animal diseases such as Rhinderpest, and plant diseases too. One way an individual could over come such harsh climates was to carry with him his trusty medicine chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Johnson (2008) states that in 1912, the Burroughs Wellcome &amp;amp; Co. felt the medicine chest was a great advance in medicine and pharmacy. Johnson (2008) argues that medicine chests were not a mere novelty, but that they played a vital role. However, Burroughs Wellcome &amp;amp; Co. sought to advertise their chest as the former, and advertised in journals such as Tropical Life and Medical Missionary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FOp7lgv_kf4/TKnDeSgI-4I/AAAAAAAAAE4/4HANvA0NemE/s1600/chestchest.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="218" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FOp7lgv_kf4/TKnDeSgI-4I/AAAAAAAAAE4/4HANvA0NemE/s320/chestchest.png" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;According to Johnson (2008) the Chest No. 250 used between 1890 and 1920 contained six 5oz. and 30 3 and a half oz. stoppered bottles of Tabloid and Soloid brand medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Here are some of the treatments they contained:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Cascara Sagrada for Sluggish Liver&lt;br&gt;Iron &amp;amp; Arsenic for Convalescence during Malarial Fevers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom:medium none;border-left:medium none;border-right:medium none;border-top:medium none"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Lead Opium for Diarrhoea&lt;br&gt;Warburg's Tincture for Malaria and other Fevers&lt;br&gt;Dover Powder for Pain Relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Johnson (2008) also states the chest contained suture needles, suture silk, oiled silk, mustard leaves, adhesive and court plasterer, caustic point, a yard of lint, catheter, glass syringes, medicine droppers, thermometer and scissors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;The chests were intended for various injuries or ailments in various climates. Evidently, this played a role in their success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Despite the  retrospective humour regarding the medicines used and the quaintness of the medicine chest. Many academics argue that the advertising of medical chests provide evidence, to some extent, that medicine was a tool of empire. However, Worboys (2000) maintains that colonial medicine can be interpretted as missionary activity, modernisation, and protection of the health and welfare of indigenous people. Critically, Worboys (2000) cites the work of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association as evidence of various aspects of Christian caring, medical humanism, colonial development and welfare policy that were active during that time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Additinally, Jones (2004) maintains that two Nightingale nurses posted to Ceylon in 1878  enabled the training of Ceylonese women for the nursing profession and therefore enabled the development of medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Evidently, Jones (2004) and Worboys (2000) suggests that Empire played a vital role in the development of medicine across the the world, and that liberal historians have been too harsh upon the colonial history of Britian in recent decades. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Arial"&gt;Critically, with the evolution of the colonies in to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, a democratic organisation of member states in which a vast number of the world's popultation live, the development of science and medicine is as vital as ever, and the politcal to-and-fro of how history should be interrepted are an annoyance to those who want to work together who share a common history, language and culture.

It’s nice to be able to write a positive one for a change. I received a prepublication proof of &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mayo-Clinic-Book-Home-Remedies/dp/1603201599/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1284318901&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies: What to Do for the Most Common Health Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;. It is due to be released on October 26 and can be pre-ordered from Amazon.com. Since “quackademic” medicine is infiltrating our best institutions and organizations, I wasn’t sure I could trust even the prestigious Mayo Clinic. I was expecting some questionable recommendations for complementary &amp;amp; alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, but I found nothing in the book that I could seriously object to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is organized alphabetically, starting with acne and airplane ear and progressing through bedbugs, boils and bronchitis, dandruff, depression and diabetes to warts, wrinkles and wrist pain. Each entry consists of (1) a description of the problem and its symptoms, (2) treatments you can try at home, and (3) when to seek professional medical help. It concludes with a short section on emergency medicine that covers anaphylaxis, bleeding, burns, CPR, choking, fracture, heart attack, poisoning, seizure, shock and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere does it mention acupuncture, chiropractic, energy medicine, or homeopathy. It gives good, clear guidance about when a health problem should not be treated with home remedies. Its recommendations about diet and exercise are solid. It doesn’t recommend anything that can’t be supported by published studies and common sense. When it recommends herbal remedies and diet supplements, it is cautious about what it claims. For instance, glucosamine and chondroitin are listed for osteoarthritis, but they point out that further study is required and they say “because the supplements may help and appear to be safe, it may not hurt to give them a try.” Not exactly a strong recommendation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For elevated cholesterol, it recommends weight loss, diet, exercise, limiting alcohol, avoiding tobacco; and then it says “Experiment with natural products. Although few natural products have been proven to reduce cholesterol, some may be helpful. You could consider…” artichoke, barley, psyllium, flaxseed, garlic, oat bran, and plant sterols. I can’t really argue with that, especially if the patient is monitored by a doctor (which of course would be required to get blood tests that would tell if the natural products have had any effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gout, they recommend against megadoses of vitamin C and their mention of cherries is fair and balanced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show an association between cherries and lower levels of uric acid in your blood, but it isn’t clear if the cherries have any effect on the signs and symptoms. Eating cherries and other dark-colored fruits, such as blackberries, blueberries, purple grapes and raspberries, may be a safe way to supplement gout treatment, but discuss this strategy with your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes appropriate warnings. For instance, in the article on bladder infections, it says that for prevention you can try cranberry juice (“though still not proven in rigorous study”), but don’t try it if you’re taking Coumadin, since it may lead to bleeding. In the cholesterol section, it warns against red yeast rice because it contains lovastatin and there is no way to determine the quantity or quality of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book recommends a few things that a rigorous scientist might hesitate to recommend because of insufficient evidence. But unlike many less trustworthy sources of medical advice, this book will not tell a patient to try anything that might be dangerous, anything that has been tested and found not to work, anything that is based on belief rather than on evidence, or anything that might delay or interfere with needed medical treatment. It is safe, sensible, and woo-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty good. I would feel comfortable recommending it to a layman who wanted to know “what home remedies can I try?” or who wanted a home reference book about what can be done instead of calling the doctor and when calling the doctor is the more prudent course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harriet Hall</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Science-Based Medicine</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286259241325"><id gr:original-id="http://arthropoda.southernfriedscience.com/?p=3558">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6d1a1db7f16d878</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Mantis Shrimp Bio-Armor</title><published>2010-10-05T00:54:36Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T00:54:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/PSb0btx_Ss4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://arthropoda.southernfriedscience.com/?p=3558"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There is mantis shrimp double-trouble in this month’s Journal of Experimental Biology, which features not one, but two papers about stomatopods.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate followers of Islam said yesterday that enforcement of the veil was a “dangerous    precedent” and that children attending such schools were being “brainwashed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Even the moderate Muslims are condemning it. I guess there’s a first time for everything. There certainly weren’t any moderate Muslims condemning extremists on &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-holy-war-americans-fear-islam/story?id=11786745"&gt;Sunday’s episode of &lt;em&gt;This Week&lt;/em&gt; with Christiane Amanpour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

After decades of being denied the flying car and robot butlers, the commercially available jetpack may finally soon be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/17/not-faking-it-why-a-placebo-can-improve-sex-life/"&gt;Nothing like sex under the influence of placebos&lt;/a&gt; – A small study of 50 women suggested that when given a placebo instead of tadalafil (which incidentally is an erectile dysfunction drug–shh, don’t tell them), many women said their sex lives significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The  women, ages 35 to 55 and all premenopausal, had all been diagnosed with  female sexual arousal disorder. But after a few weeks on the placebo,  the women as a group reported less distress and more fun in their sex  lives.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows &lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;. And if you recall each hero in that story was seeking something. The Tin Man was seeking a heart. For some time now medical science has been able to give people artificial hearts. But we haven’t given one to a child until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/boy-gets-robotic-heart.html#mkcpgn=rssnws1"&gt;For the first time, a 15-year-old has been successfully implanted with a robotic heart&lt;/a&gt; by doctors in Italy. And while these artificial hearts are typically only temporary, due to the boy’s Duchenne muscular dystrophy, his robotic heart is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure “opened new therapeutic perspectives and hope for life for  all patients with cardiac illnesses for whom a transplant is needed,  especially for those like Thursday’s patient who cannot receive a  donated heart for clinical reasons,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, to quote Carl Sagan, science delivers the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

Her child's earache, not surprisingly, continued to worsen. Because the mother was unable to tell that what she had gotten wasn't real medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some investigating, I found that the Wal-Mart online store sells two homeopathic "remedies". The first is Ring Relief. Its active ingredient, Benzalkonium Chloride, is, according to &lt;a href="http://www.drugs.com/cdi/benzalkonium-chloride-liquid.html"&gt;Drugs.Com&lt;/a&gt; is an antiseptic similar to that used at an ear-piercing kiosk for after an ear piercing has been done. It is generally used for treating minor cuts, scrapes and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tinnitus/DS00365/DSECTION=causes"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; states none of the possible causes of tinnitus are treatable with an antiseptic. While there IS a wide range of causes for the issue, not one is related to viral or bacterial infestation in the ear canal or inner ear. This so called remedy is useless for what it claims to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The other, more insidious "remedy" offered by Wal-Mart is Oscilliococcinum. The claim on the box reads "Reduces Severity And Duration Of Flu Symptoms". According to one reviewer, their kids really enjoy taking this "remedy" because it's "fun" to take. Another reviewer stated that these are "sugar-tasting, pop rock-like things". For anyone not familiar, many homeopathic remedies are tiny sugar pills that have had a few drops of the diluted substance of choice added to them. This one is the same. So each dose consists of several tiny sugar pills that dissolve on the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active ingredient in Oscilliococcinum is Anas Barbariae Hepatis Et Cordis. For those of us not fluent in Latin, that would be the extract of the liver and heart of the wild duck. The original species used, according to Homeowatch.org was Canard de Barbarie. Today we know these animals as Muscovy Ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence to suggest that the heart and liver of this particular species of duck has any anti viral properties. Homeopathy's guiding principle is that "like cures like". Even if there were scientific evidence to back up this disproved theory, the flu is based neither in the heart or the liver. Nor is the cause of the flu based in either organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most disturbing is that one of the reviewers on the Wal-Mart web site says clearly that it is safe for children. Tiny duck and sugar tic tacks with no more duck than a molecule or two IS, of course, safe. However, that's the problem. There is 1) not enough active ingredient in this product to create ANY sort of effect on the illness it claims to alleviate and 2) The active ingredient has absolutely nothing to do with the ailment it is supposed to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On further investigation, I discovered the local Wal-Mart had two additional homeopathic &amp;quot;remedies&amp;quot; available. The first is Hyland&amp;#39;s Cough Syrup. It was in there right next to the other children&amp;#39;s cough syrups in the pharmacy. Hyland&amp;#39;s, according to it&amp;#39;s web site, offers 23 children&amp;#39;s products ALONE. Fortunately the local Wal-Mart only carries this one. The listed active ingredients are Ipecacuanha (the basis for Ipecac Syrup - a substance to induce vomiting), Aconitum Napellus (Otherwise known as Aconite or Monk&amp;#39;s Hood - a poison that affect the heart and lungs), Spongia Tosta (roasted sea sponge) and Antimonium Tartaricum (aka Tartar Emetic-used to induce vomiting). All of these substances have been diluted to 10 to the  -6th power or to point that there are six parts substance to six MILLION parts distilled water for each substance. The remaining substances don&amp;#39;t have enough potency to have any effect. The other &amp;quot;remedy I found was a homeopathic herbal extract of Black Elderberry called Sambucol. This is a dilution of a berry extract that, while it may have some promise, still needs more &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818374"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there ARE only four homeopathic-based items available, Wal-Mart is not the only major pharmacy chain that offer homeopathy. CVS and Walgreen’s also offer homeopathic products on their web site. CVS has a homeopathic arthritis/pain relief "remedy", among other. Walgreen’s, the worst offender, offers 14 different products including a bacterial vaginosis "treatment” and a pink eye "remedy". Without proper medical treatment, both conditions can lead to serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do corporations such as Wal-Mart have a responsibility to investigate the items that they sell?  Is this just a matter of Buyer Beware? If corporations are not responsible, where &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; the responsibility lie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it lies solely with the consumer, we as skeptics need to be out there educating not only individuals, but boardrooms as well. If the people who make the purchasing decisions are educated, then these products will hopefully eventually be removed from store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>mblanford@randi.org (Maria Myrback)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286248373854"><id gr:original-id="http://deepseanews.com/2010/10/penguins-immediately-benefit-from-mpa/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/737c8bd5c69d8727</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Penguins Immediately Benefit From MPA</title><published>2010-10-04T22:20:19Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T22:20:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9rNKThOWh9E/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://deepseanews.com/2010/10/penguins-immediately-benefit-from-mpa/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There is much buzz these days about marine protected areas (MPAs) and no-take zones.

Vacuum-Driven Evolution in Astrophysics

William C. C. Lima, George E. A. Matsas, &amp;amp; Daniel A. T. Vanzella (2010). Awaking the vacuum in relativistic stars Physical Review Letters arXiv: 1009.1771v1

In a very cool paper that will be appearing in the Physical Review Letters at the end of the week, Lima et al. have shown an interesting (and surprising) relationship between neutron star formation and the vacuum energy density of our universe. Using some semi-classical concepts of gravity [PRL 104,                       161102                       (2010)], the authors come the conclusion that the formation of relativistic, compact, objects (like neutron stars) could disturb the vacuum of a quantum field (of a certain type) which could cause the energy density of the vacuum to undergo exponential growth.  This growth could eventually lead to the collapse or explosion of the relativistic object in question.  Of course, the observation of stable neutron stars should be suggestive that such fields (that could have triggered this exponential growth in energy density) can not exist.  Thus, if we see stable neutron stars (which we think we do), we learn something about the vacuum state of the universe, ie. the observation of a stable and (reasonably) spinless cold neutron star would rule out the existence of massless scalar fields with a range of coupling constants.  Seeing as we only know what a marginal fraction of the universe’s energy content is, this could prove incredibly useful for the field theoretically inclined cosmologists out there.  The nitty-gritty details on what should specifically happen to these relativistic objects hasn’t been worked out just yet (I’m sure someone will be donating some cluster time soon), but when it has, we may end up learning something new and exciting about one of the most basic aspects of our universe.

Randomness Brings Order to Quarks

P. H. Damgaard, K. Splittorff, &amp;amp; J. J. M. Verbaarschot (2010). Microscopic Spectrum of the Wilson Dirac Operator arXiv arXiv: 1001.2937v3

An interesting paper out of the Niels Bohr Institute shows how large quantities of random numbers can help explain the oscillations of quarks within protons.

Kim Splittorff:

Over several years it became increasingly clear that the way in which  the left-handed and right-handed quarks come together can be described  using a massive quantities of random numbers. These random numbers are  elements in a matrix, which one may think of as a Soduko filled in at  random. In technical jargon these are called Random Matrices.

Random numbers have been used for quite some time to make sense of spontaneous symmetry breaking, but what is unique about this team’s work is that they are doing it exactly.

Splittorff:

What is new about our work is that not only the exact equation for  quarks, but also the approximation, which researchers who work  numerically have to use, can be described using random matrices. It is  already extremely surprising that the exact equation shows that the  quarks swing by random numbers. It is even more exciting that the  approximation used for the equation has a completely analogous  description. Having an accurate analytical description available for the  numerical simulations is a powerful tool that provides an entirely new  understanding of the numerical data. In particular, we can now measure  very precisely how closely the right-handed and left-handed quarks are  dancing

How “exact” this really can be, is more of a philosophical question at this point, but this technique will find use in helping make predictions at CERN and even in condensed matter systems.

Hawking Radiation, Observed?

F. Belgiorno, S. L. Cacciatori, M. Clerici, V. Gorini, G. Ortenzi, L. Rizzi, E. Rubino, V. G. Sala, &amp;amp; D. Faccio (2010). Hawking radiation from ultrashort laser pulse filaments arXiv arXiv: 1009.4634v1

I have lengthy comments to make on this paper that will appear later this week, but it is a fascinating (and short) read.

The abstract:

Event horizons of astrophysical black holes and gravitational analogues have been predicted to excite the quantum vacuum and give rise to the emission of quanta, known as Hawking radiation. We experimentally create such a gravitational analogue using ultrashort laser pulse filaments and our measurements demonstrate a spontaneous emission of photons that confirms theoretical predictions.

Did they really observe Hawking radiation? That’s a question that will be open for debate for quite some time.

They are now appealing to the science blogging community for assistance to make 2011 the best meeting yet! Anton has posted &lt;a href="http://scienceonline2011.com/2010/10/10-ways-to-help-with-scienceonline2011/"&gt;10 ways to help&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the logo. The ScienceOnline2010 logo looked great, but had a  serious flaw — the fancy atom couldn’t print on a non-white background.  We need someone with Photoshop or Illustrator expertise to rebuild the  logo and customize it for  ScienceOnline2011 (notice we’ve reduced the  size and placement of the atom).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the T-shirt — be creative — and arrange for printing and  delivery (and maybe help find a sponsor to underwrite the costs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the webmaster for this site, and help us make it more compelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the webmaster for the &lt;a href="http://scio11.wikispaces.com/"&gt;planning wiki&lt;/a&gt;,  and help us get the look and feel there to match this site. Also on the  wiki, add your program ideas and tell us if you’d like to be a session  discussion leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a sponsor. Download the &lt;a href="http://scienceonline2011.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ScienceOnline2011-info-sheet.pdf"&gt;ScienceOnline2011 info sheet&lt;/a&gt; and share with companies, organizations, institutions and individuals  who might be willing to become a sponsor of the conference — have them  contact me (zuiker@gmail.com). While you’re at it, visit the  ScienceOnline2010 sponsors (&lt;a href="http://scienceonline2010.com/"&gt;logos linked here&lt;/a&gt;) and share your appreciation for their past support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a donor willing to help us order lots of Flip video cameras. At  ScienceOnline2010, we were able to give out a couple dozen cameras in  exchange for short videos of conference participants (&lt;a href="http://www.iescience.com/blog/2010/01/reflections-from-science-online-2010/"&gt;see this post&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and more examples &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scio11&amp;amp;aq=f"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a North Carolina organization willing to be our institutional  partner (meaning our checkbook — accept sponsorship checks, write a few  dozen checks to pay our bills, earn our admiration and gratitude).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer another way to help. Use the &lt;a href="http://scienceonline2011.com/?page_id=14"&gt;Contact form&lt;/a&gt; to let us know about your talents, interests and experiences, and how we can put those to use in planning the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help someone in your community learn to blog, tweet or make use of  social networking tools (Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr). Why?  ScienceOnline2011 is a BlogTogether event, and we want the spirit of  conversation to spread (&lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/article/4214/when-blogging-face-the-conversation"&gt;read this essay for background&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceonline2011.com/?page_id=17"&gt;Sign up for updates&lt;/a&gt; so you can be the first to know when registration opens. Tweet, blog and tell your friends, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Some of them have involved us directly, but we didn’t (don’t) want to have RC become just a blog about us. However, the latest move by Ken Cuccinelli, the Attorney General of Virginia, against Mike Mann and UVa is so ridiculous it needs to be highlighted to the widest audience possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For background, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/30/AR2010083005004.html"&gt;Rosalind Helderman at the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; has covered most of the story. The last installment was that Cuccinelli’s attempt to subpoena 10 years of emails between 39 scientists and Mike Mann and ‘all documents’ residing at UVa related to four federal and one Commonwealth of Virginia grant, was thrown out by a judge because Cuccinelli did not provide any reason to suspect that fraud had occurred and that federal grants are not covered by the relevant statute. Without due cause, the AG is not allowed to investigate (and without such a restriction, there would be no end to politically motivated witch hunts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Cuccinelli filed &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/New%20Mann%20CID.PDF"&gt;a new demand&lt;/a&gt; that takes this previous judgment into account. Namely, he attempts to give a reason to suspect fraud and only targets the Commonwealth grant – though still asks for 10 years of emails with an assortment of scientists.  However, his reasoning should scare the bejesus of anyone who has ever published a paper on any topic that any attorney might have a political grudge against. For the two papers in question the fraud allegation is that the authors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… knew or should have known [that they] contained false information, unsubstantiated claims, and/or were otherwise misleading. Specifically, but without limitation, some of the conclusions of the papers demonstrate a complete lack of rigor regarding the statistical analysis of the alleged data, meaning the result reported lacked statistical significance without a specific statement to that effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in other words, if you publish a result that might turn out to be statistically weak or with understated error bars – even if this was in no way deliberate and regardless if you were aware of it at the time – Cuccinelli thinks that is equivalent to fraud. And any grant that you apply for that even cites this paper would therefore be a false claim under the statute. Cuccinelli is specifically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; stating that deliberate scientific misconduct must have occurred, all you need to have performed is an inadequate (according to him) statistical treatment or you made an unsubstantiated claim. If you want “unsubstainted claims”,  Soon and Baliunas (2003) (cited approvingly by Cuccinelli) would be a great example of course. But more generally, this would clearly open up pretty much the entire literature to ‘fraud’ investigations since one can almost always improve on the statistics. You didn’t take temporal auto-correlation into account in calculating the trend? Cuccinelli thinks that’s fraud. You didn’t fully characterise the systematic uncertainty in the “unknown unknowns”? That too. You weren’t aware of the new data that showed an older paper was incomplete? Too bad. This is not just an attack on Mike Mann, it is an attack on the whole scientific enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as appalling as this reasoning is, Cuccinelli’s latest request is simply bone-headed because the grant in question, entitled “Resolving the scale-wise sensitivities in the dynamical coupling between the climate and biosphere”, simply has nothing to do with the MBH98 and MBH99 papers! Even if one agreed with Cuccinelli about their quality (which we don’t), they are not referenced or mentioned even obliquely.  The grant was to look at how climate variability impacted land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon, water and heat and doesn’t involve paleo-climate at all. So even if, for arguments sake, one accepted Cuccinelli’s definition of what constitutes ‘fraud’, nothing associated with this grant would qualify. We doubt there could be a clearer demonstration of the inappropriateness of Cuccinelli’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe one. In the attachment to the subpoena, Cuccinelli repeats his claim that since Mann used the word “community” in a blog post &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/09/communicating-science-not-just-talking-the-talk/"&gt;here on RC&lt;/a&gt;, he must therefore be using “Post Normal” jargon, and that might be “misleading/fraudulent” in the context of a grant application. Really? Scientists who use the word “community” regardless of context are therefore to be suspected of fraud? This is just embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be worth pointing out that under the &lt;a href="http://www.vsb.org/docs/2009-10-pg-rpc.pdf"&gt;Virginia Bar ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, it states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;When I can't sleep, I go onto TED.com. I'm watching a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/steven_pinker_chalks_it_up_to_the_blank_slate.html"&gt;talk by Pinker&lt;/a&gt; and  he says syllabuses at one point (about 15:36). Not sure if you've blogged about syllabuses versus syllabi in the Language Log, but  I think it'd be a pretty cool topic to discuss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say "syllabuses" as well, though I can't recall the last time I had occasion to use the plural form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the word is a fake to start with, a misinterpretation due to scribal error. Here's what the OED sez:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/OED_SyllabusEtymology.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/OED_SyllabusEtymology.png" width="490" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we were going to be etymologically exact, the singular should be "sittyba" and the plural should be "sittybes", or something like that.  Why should we invent a fake Latin plural to go with the fake Latin singular? My advice is to stick with plain English &lt;em&gt;syllabuses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286236663004"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/how_many_ways_can_we_screw_up.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/506209079a364233</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">How many ways can we screw up little girls?</title><published>2010-10-05T00:19:02Z</published><updated>2010-10-05T00:19:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xh_9CYWBP28/how_many_ways_can_we_screw_up.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/how_many_ways_can_we_screw_up.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/10/how_many_ways_can_we_screw_up/myprincessbible.jpeg" width="200" height="200" alt="myprincessbible.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a little disappointed, though. Is there also a Bratz Bible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/teachers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="teachers" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/teachers.jpg?w=460&amp;amp;h=322" alt="" width="460" height="322"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the buzz phrases going around in many education circles these days is “merit pay.”  The whole idea of merit pay is that you tie the salaries of teachers to the performance of their students, either by assessing how much kids have learned via their grades or on standardized tests.  At first blush, this sounds like a great idea – the really good, energetic, and inspiring teachers get paid more and the lazy slugs get paid less.  Meanwhile, it gives other teachers an incentive to become more involved &amp;amp; innovative in the classroom so that – the logic goes – they get the students to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s one big problem with the entire concept of merit pay:&lt;em&gt; it seems that it doesn’t work.&lt;/em&gt; In a recent National Public Radio story it was revealed that there is now extensive research which calls into question the validity of merit pay…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130029725"&gt;Study: Teacher Bonuses Don’t Improve Test Scores&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering big bonuses to teachers failed to raise students’ test  scores in a three-year study released Tuesday that calls into question  the Obama administration’s push for merit pay to improve education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  study, conducted in the metropolitan Nashville school system by  Vanderbilt University’s National Center on Performance Incentives, was  described by the researchers as the nation’s first scientifically  rigorous look at merit pay for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It  found that students whose teachers were offered bonuses of up to $15,000  a year for improved test scores registered the same gains on  standardized exams as those whose teachers were given no such  incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s some pretty damning evidence against the merit pay concept.  At least, it is damning evidence against the manner in which merit pay is being proposed to be implemented the way that many education reformers wish to see it done.  Personally, though I have some ideological hangups with the idea of merit pay (&lt;strong&gt;full disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a strong proponent of teachers’ unions), I am not willing to completely throw the baby out with the bathwater on the basis of this one study; I think more research is necessary.  However, I think it is worth slowing down the rush by many to push merit pay as some kind of cure-all for the broken parts of our public education system.  I like how the lead researcher of the study puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think most people agree today that the current way in which we  compensate teachers is broken,” said Matthew Springer, executive  director of the Vanderbilt center and lead researcher on the study. &lt;strong&gt;“But  we don’t know what the better way is yet.” &lt;/strong&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I’m all for reforming education &amp;amp; getting bad teachers out of the profession (we need it), but we cannot simply get hung up on the latest fad to come along (and if you’ve been in education in the U.S. for any length of time, you know that such fads are a common occurrence).  In that sense, this research serves as a cautionary tale.  And, in my opinion, we cannot expect to find one solution that will fit all of the problems in our public education system which varies so widely in terms of socio-economic conditions, ethnicity, culture, etc.  We are going to have to probably find local solutions &amp;amp; local reforms to the specific problems of local schools – which means our education reformers should avoid the temptation to simply jump onto the merit pay bandwagon because it promises to fix everything.  Solutions to such complex societal problems are not so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I’d like to finish with the final paragraph of the NPR article reporting on the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to say, ‘I’ll pay you more if you do better.’ You’ve  got to help people know how to do better,” said Amy Wilkins, vice  president of the Education Trust, a Washington think tank. “Absolutely  we should reward them once they do better, but to think merit pay alone  will get them there is insane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This, he said, was because Catholicism created more integrated societies. In today&amp;#39;s parlance, Catholicism generates more social capital.

Since then many studies reinforced this theory, showing that Catholicism, and indeed religion in general, seems to protect against suicide. Unfortunately, almost all these studies have been flawed - most often because they looked at average suicide rates and average religious beliefs across particular societies. They didn&amp;#39;t look at the individual characteristics of those people who commit suicide.

Three new studies have addressed this problem. Each of them them takes advantage of new data to explore in some detail the link between religion and reduced suicide.

I&amp;#39;m going to write them up in separate posts, as they all tell different aspects of the story. What they do have in common, though, is that they all show that that the story isn&amp;#39;t quite as straightforward as Durkheim believed!

Matthias Egger, at the University of Bern in Switzerland, has cleverly linked census data to death records - not at all as straightforward as you might imagine. What that gives, for the first time, is a large database with reliable records of individual&amp;#39;s religious affiliation in the last few years before they took their life. 

What they found was that, as Durkeheim found when looking at Swiss data a century earlier, Catholics had the lowest suicide rate and Protestants higher. What&amp;#39;s more, Egger found that the unaffiliated had the highest of all.

But there was more to this story than meets the eye. One thing that jumped out was that the gap was much bigger for older people. At ages 35-44, there was essentially no difference. The gap grows gradually with age: in the oldest group (aged 85-94), Protestants are twice as likely as Catholics to commit suicide, and the unaffiliated four times as likely.

And Egger found something else. Strangely enough, the effect was particularly strong for death by poisoning.

That&amp;#39;s a perplexing result, until you remember that Switzerland is one of the few countries where assisted suicide is legal (so long as the motive is not selfish). There are several societies in Switzerland that provide assisted dying, with the usual method being an injection of barbiturates.

On the death record, that&amp;#39;s recorded as a death by poisoning.

So what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is driven in large part by differences in attitudes towards assisted dying. Elderly Catholics, who see suicide as a sin, prefer a natural death. Elderly Protestants and, especially, the unaffiliated, have a different view.

The unaffiliated see assisted dying as an acceptable way to deal with terminal, debilitating, and often painful illness. As a result, the suicide rate among the very old is higher.

That&amp;#39;s not to say that Durkheim was wrong about religion. Social integration is important in reducing suicide, and that may well have contributed to the differences seen. Egger found that married people, and those living with others, also had lower suicide rates. But these data couldn&amp;#39;t show that religion affected social integration.

But what Egger has shown is that the relationship between religion and suicide is more complex than sometimes assumed. Just how complex is the topic of the next post, which looks at suicide rates in different cultures around the world.

The designs received so far have been so impressive that we are extending the contest. Back in November 2009 the JREF announced the release of the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-visa-offer.html"&gt;JREF Capital One Visa card&lt;/a&gt;, available to anyone interested in supporting the JREF through the use of a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREF Capital One Visa Card helps the JREF because the first purchase made on the card triggers a gift of $50 from Capital One to the JREF. And once the card is active, 1% of everything spent on the card goes to the JREF to help fund our valuable and much needed programs fighting woo-woo and helping to get critical thinking resources into the classroom. As an added bonus, 2% of groceries and gasoline purchases go to the JREF as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img style="margin:1px;border-width:1px" alt="CC_ART_1" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/CC_ART_1.jpg" height="161" width="198"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:1px;border-width:1px" alt="CC_ART_2" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/CC_ART_2.jpg" height="170" width="205"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two samples of the artwork submitted for the contest so far.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREF Capital One Visa card currently has one design with an iconic picture of James Randi emblazoned on the card. However, variety is the spice of life and Capital One allows the JREF to have up to three card designs for this Visa card, so we are launching an art contest to allow our dedicated and very talented supporters to come up with two new designs for the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submit your artwork for the JREF Capital One Visa Card before November 30, 2010.  We are asking for contest submissions of artwork to adorn the JREF Capital One Visa card. This is your chance to have a lasting impact on the JREF by designing a new iconic image for the card!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning design will be chosen by James “The Amazing” Randi and the design finalists will be posted on the JREF website (&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/../"&gt;www.randi.org&lt;/a&gt;) so that JREF members can vote on which design they think should adorn the second card. At the end of the contest we’ll have two brand new JREF Capital One Visa card designs to choose from giving JREF members and the public a pair of new reasons to order a JREF Capital One Visa Card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners will be announced on December 10, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contest Prizes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition of designing one of the three JREF Capital One Visa credit      card designs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Prize winner gets a JREF Swag Bag (a collection of JREF      Paraphernalia) plus a copy of An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and      Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural by James Randi. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Prize winner gets a JREF Swag Bag (a collection of JREF      Paraphernalia). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contest Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contest Start Date: April 1, 2010. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contest End Date: November 30, 2010. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One entry per person. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contest is available to JREF supporters the world over, but the credit      card is only available to US residents. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entries must be tasteful and are subject to disqualification by      the JREF if the content is deemed to be unacceptable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entries will be displayed on the JREF website with the name of      the artist. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry Parameters: The image parameters are 2 ½ inches by 3 ¼      inches. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that the finished design will have the JREF Logo in the      upper left corner, the Capital One logo in the upper right corner, and the      VISA logo in the lower right corner. These logos are all added later and      you do not have to worry about these other than to be aware that they will      sit over those portions of the card as shown below. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JREF reserves the right to disqualify any entry. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first-place winning entry will be chosen at the sole      discretion of the JREF and Mr. James Randi. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second place entry will be selected by a vote of registered      JREF members and will be subject to the approval of the JREF. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prizes are subject to change without notice at the sole      discretion of the JREF. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eMail Contest Submissions to Development@Randi.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the JREF Capital One Visa Card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a program from Capital One, you can earn $50 for the JREF with your first purchase. Subsequent purchases will earn the JREF 1% of sales, which may be tax deductible for US residents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to show your support without having to do anything other than switching your credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$50 donation to JREF with first purchase. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1% of all purchases donated to JREF (may be tax deductible) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2% of all gasoline and grocery purchases donated to JREF &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No annual fee &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JREF branded card or design your own! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24/7 Travel and emergency assistance, including roadside &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rental car insurance &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buyer's protection &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JREF thanks you for your support. Your efforts here help keep us strong and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you activate your card the message from Capital One will read that Capital One has made a $50 donation to the JREF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The JREF suggests that anyone applying for and using a JREF Capital One Visa Card use credit responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>zoiks@shaw.ca (Bart Farkas)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286232986667"><id gr:original-id="1110 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f914e752b2cdb42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Choosing mates: do we REALLY want what we say we want?</title><published>2010-10-04T20:36:18Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T20:36:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1110" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.bvgasa.org/sam/MileOfMen.jpg" width="250" height="200" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cathy,” the comic of 34 years, &lt;a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-12/entertainment/ct-live-0812-cathy-comic-20100812_1_cathy-creator-cathy-guisewite-strip"&gt;ended yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but don’t despair: You won’t be left to suffer life’s little annoyances alone. Buzzfeed is reviving Cathy Guisewite’s famous scenes in &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/newcathy/new-cathy"&gt;“The New Cathy”&lt;/a&gt; with a little their own captioning, and we think the results are pretty hilarious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chefann.com/"&gt;“Renegade Lunch Lady” Ann Cooper&lt;/a&gt;,  pictured left, is on a crusade to bring healthier options to school  lunchrooms across the country. Cooper, a classically trained chef,  author, educator and now nutrition services director, is revolutionizing  the way American kids eat at school. With the prevalence of childhood &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and 30 million kids enrolled in the &lt;a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/"&gt;National School Lunch Program&lt;/a&gt;, the lunchroom may be the best place to effect change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Cooper started &lt;a href="http://www.foodfamilyfarming.org/"&gt;Food Family Farming Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,  a nonprofit founded to change the school food landscape by developing a  sustainable model for schools nationwide. In order to promote and carry  out F3’s mission, Cooper, with help from &lt;a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"&gt;Whole Foods Market&lt;/a&gt;, launched &lt;a href="http://www.thelunchbox.org/"&gt;The Lunch Box&lt;/a&gt;,  a Web portal offering a free online toolkit with recipes, menus,  calendars, training materials and other resources. This year, Cooper is  focusing her efforts on putting a salad bar in every public school  lunchroom in America. Cooper wants kids everywhere to have access to  fresh, wholesome, made-from-scratch foods and believes that salad bars  are the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the ball rolling, &lt;a href="http://www.saladbarproject.org/"&gt;The Great American Salad Bar Project&lt;/a&gt;,  a partnership between F3 and Whole Foods, is giving away free salad bar  kits to 300-plus schools within 50 miles of a Whole Foods. Through  online and in-store donations, the initiative has set a fundraising goal  of $750,000 — enough money to fund 300 salad bars — between now and  September 30. Cooper hopes to surpass that goal and give away at least  400 salad bars — a distinct possibility, given that the project has  already raised more than $680,000 with more than three weeks to go.&lt;/p&gt;

Aquamation, a new method of body disposal, is starting to provide a &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2022206,00.html?xid=newsletter-weekly#ixzz11PL3forV"&gt;green alternative to burial and cremation&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can have negative impacts on the environment through greenhouse gases and leaching of embalming liquids into the soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, Aquamation Industries, is based in Australia and disposes of corpses by putting them in a stainless steel vat containing a potassium-hydroxide and water solution, which takes four hours to dissolve the body until all that’s left is the skeleton, which is then crushed and given to the family of the deceased. The remaining liquid, is then tested and adjusted for the correct pH and can be used like a fertilizer, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though aquamation sounds relatively eco-friendly, some are wary of the potassium hydroxide, a chemical that’s similar to oven cleaner, dissolving human bodies the same way it dissolves cooking oils and grease. Some environmental scientists claim that it would be just as good to be buried (in biodegradable materials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re no scientists, so we can’t tell you which burial method does the best by mother nature, but we wonder whether alternative burial methods could really take off enough to make a difference. Would you elect to be aquamated? Do you have a special emotional or cultural attachment to a particular burial method? Tell us what you think of green burials in the comments section below:&lt;/p&gt;

Today, I have another treat for you.  Friend of Skepchick&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; Marie Porter of &lt;a href="http://www.celebrationgeneration.com/cakeindex.html"&gt;Celebration Generation Cakes &lt;/a&gt;has a new cookbook out.  It’s not just any old cookbook, either.  &lt;a href="http://www.spiritedbaker.com/"&gt;The Spirited Baker&lt;/a&gt; is your gateway to turning your kitchen into an emporium of boozy sweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IndexSBCover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IndexSBCover.jpg" alt="" title="IndexSBCover" width="215" height="294"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been lucky enough to sample several of the recipes over the past months, as Marie created them and Michael photographed them.  Some highlights included light and fluffy fruit pavlova, rich and complex dark beer toffees, decadent chocolate dessert raviolis, and a variety of wonderful liqueurs.  My sobriety rarely survives a visit to the Porter house intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is organized in a very intuitive format.  It begins with basic techniques for creating your own liqueurs and infusions, moving on into a huge variety of treats to be made from these homemade tinctures (or basic stock from your local liquor store, for those who prefer to do less work).  Marie takes the reader through over 160 recipes, spanning everything from cookies to tortes, truffles to brownies.  Beyond that, each section offers a wonderful scaffold from which the more adventurous baker may improvise with the basic recipes and create an endless variety of custom delicacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried my hand at just such an endeavor a few days ago.  I found a nice pie pumpkin at the farmers market last week, and thought that, paired with some spiced rum and a pecan crust, it would make for a dynamite cheesecake flavor.  I would not be disappointed.  Marie’s basic cheesecake recipe was a dream to riff on, and is seriously the best one i’ve encountered.  I’m not just saying that because she’s my friend and she feeds me sweets every time I see her, either.  This cheesecake is simultaneously creamy, fluffy, and delicate, with just the right amount of richness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect we have many readers who share an appreciation for sweets and alcohol, and, while not really related to skepticism, I thought this would be of interest.  Not only is the recipe content great, Michael’s photography is beautiful.  It’s a very pretty book; basically food porn.  So &lt;a href="http://www.spiritedbaker.com/TheSpiritedBaker.html"&gt;go buy a copy&lt;/a&gt;, and share your adventures and inventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286226468873"><id gr:original-id="http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2010/10/how-grows-your-garden/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9cf50cb7898bee65</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">How Grows Your Garden?</title><published>2010-10-04T15:52:33Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T15:52:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ezeAEnFUChs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2010/10/how-grows-your-garden/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Inch by inch, row by row, plant preservationists need to be aware of how their gardens grow.

The example is from the United States, which is an easy target in this regard, but we have had a similar episode in Ireland recently so I don’t think we (or indeed any other non-Americans) can feel particularly smug about it.  This one is especially funny, though.Christine O’Donnell has recently won the Republican nomination in Delaware for the upcoming election to the Senate.  I just love her – for comic entertainment this woman is very good value.  She makes Sarah Palin look like the most reasonable, well-informed, level-headed person around.  Among many clangers that she has dropped in the past, the one that really got my attention was the following assertion, made during a debate on stem cells on The O’Reilly Factor show on Fox News a few years ago:     &amp;quot;American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans and animals and coming up with mice with fully functioning human brains. So they&amp;#39;re already into this experiment.&amp;quot; That’s right, cross-breeding humans and animals.  I’m not sure how she imagines that to have taken place and would rather not know.  And yes, she did say: mice with fully functioning human brains.  Now, the average mouse weighs around 20 grams.  The average human brain (clearly there are exceptions) weighs around 1.4 kilograms.  I’m not sure Ms. O’Donnell really thought that through, even from a purely mechanical standpoint.  However, she apparently had the opportunity to qualify or alter her assertion but did not, so one can assume she meant something like what she actually said.  (She also thinks evolution is a myth, because if we evolved from monkeys, then how come the monkeys are not still evolving into humans?  That some people buy that kind of “argument” exemplifies the poor grasp that many people have of geological time.  And of the fact that we did not evolve from monkeys – monkeys and humans evolved from a common ancestor.  It reminds me of an even funnier comment I read from another creationist: if we evolved from monkeys, then how come we don’t speak monkey?  There’s just no answer to that.)What the imaginative Ms. O’Donnell may have been trying to refer to was a story that got some press coverage at the time of scientists who had transplanted a small number of human cells into a mouse brain to see if they would migrate and integrate normally.  Apparently, about 100 such cells survived, in a brain that contains over 20 million cells.  So, transplantation, not cross-breeding, and not fully functioning human brains, but to be fair to her she did, in an incredibly inept and confused manner, raise an interesting issue.  That is the question of whether it is ever a good idea (or morally or ethically right) to create an organism whose cells derive from two different species – a so-called chimera (named after the mythically mixed-up creature).  This is especially touchy when some of the cells are of human origin.  Why, you might legitimately ask, would anyone want to do such a thing?Well, there are lots of reasons, none of which involves playing God just for fun, or actually wanting to create a hybrid organism.  Most of the studies that have carried out such experiments are designed to test the potential of stem cells for regeneration of damaged parts of the brain.  Stem cells can be obtained from many different sources, including early human embryos, umbilical cord blood and bone marrow.  New technologies now allow fully differentiated adult cells from various tissues to be retro-differentiated into stem cells (so-called induced pluripotent stem cells).  All of these cell types hold great promise for regenerative medicine, especially ones that are of the same genotype as the prospective patient.  But how to test them?  Just injecting them into patient’s brains doesn’t seem like the best approach, though actually it has been done in some cases of seriously ill patients in the late stages of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease.  Initial results seemed to suggest some clinical improvement but larger, more carefully controlled trials have been largely disappointing.  These studies involved injection of primary human fetal cells into the brains of adult patients and were not particularly sophisticated in terms of how these cells were treated prior to injection.  With better defined populations of stem cells it is now possible, for example, to differentiate them into particular types of neurons (or their direct progenitors) prior to transplantation.  To determine the efficacy of such treatments, animal models have of these disorders have been used.  Human cells will integrate fairly happily into a rodent or even a chick brain.  (No chick jokes, please).  The brain is immune privileged and grafts of foreign cells are generally well tolerated by the host.  Using this approach it is possible to determine how such transplanted cells survive, migrate and integrate into the brain (under the assumption that such processes would be much the same in a human brain).  More importantly, it is possible to determine whether transplantation of such cells results in any improvement in the animal’s condition.  Such studies are generating promising results in models of stroke, spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (see a few recent examples below).  It is still early days, however, and a lot more pre-clinical research like this will have to be carried out to characterise how these cells behave after transplantation, before they will be approved for clinical use.  So, nothing sinister, no witchcraft (sorry, Christine, I know you like that), no hybrid mouse-humans scuttling into the dark corner of the lab when the lights are turned on.  Just scientists and clinicans trying hard to find cures for serious diseases.  Nothing sensationalist at all really.  Sorry.Snyder BR, Chiu AM, Prockop DJ, &amp;amp; Chan AW (2010).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A homosexual struggling against the temptation to act homosexual is no different from anyone else struggling to resist a sinful temptation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Shore&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href="http://johnshore.com/2010/10/01/how-is-being-gay-like-gluing-wings-on-a-pig/"&gt;a great response to this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is that Big Difference between homosexuality and other sins: There is no sin I can commit that, by &lt;em&gt;virtue&lt;/em&gt; of committing it, renders me incapable of loving or being loved. I can commit murder. I can steal. I can rob. I can rape. I can drink myself to death. I can do any terrible thing at all — and no one would ever claim that intrinsic to the condition that gave rise to my doing that terrible thing is that I am, by nature, simply incapable of giving or receiving love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you tell a gay person to “resist” being gay, what you are really telling them — what you really &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; — is for them to be celibate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you are truly and actually saying is that you want them to condemn themselves to a life devoid of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be alone, you’re demanding. Live alone. Don’t hold anyone’s hand. Don’t snuggle on your couch with anyone. Don’t cuddle up with anyone at  night before you fall asleep. Don’t have anyone to chat with over coffee in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not bind your life to that of another. Live your whole life without knowing that joy, that sharing, that peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just say “no” to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be alone. Live alone. Die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “sinful temptation” that Christians are forever urging LGBT people to resist is love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being, of course, the &lt;em&gt;one thing&lt;/em&gt; Jesus was most clear about wanting his followers to extend to others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to hear a pastor say &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in church one weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How any Christian can claim to follow a religion of love and then deny gay people equal rights is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this before with regard to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/07/01/im-sorry-is-not-enough-for-the-gay-community/"&gt;Andrew Marin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s not enough to simply apologize for the way the church has treated gay people in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not out there fighting in favor of marriage equality, against the notion that homosexuality is a choice, against the absurd idea that homosexuality is somehow sinful (or &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sinful than anything else you call a “sin”)… if you’re not out there fighting any rule/law that says gay people are inferior to straight people, then you don’t deserve my respect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

BD2 tossed out the usual list of Creationist fallacies, among them the bifurcated fallacy of "Big Bang is wrong, thus Goddidit."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fallacy aside, the premise of the Big Bang being wrong is one that needs some serious evidence. I've &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2006/07/big-bang-common-misconceptions.html"&gt;addressed the Big Bang before&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrated that there's several independent lines of evidence that converge to support it. So how does BD2 support that the Big Bang is wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially he linked to an article in an Indian Newspaper citing an article in the Journal of Cosmology. The main point of the article was that we haven't detected gravitational waves, thus the Big Bang is wrong.... as if the linchpin of the entire Big Bang Theory is gravitational waves....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went ahead and looked for the original article and eventually found it... on &lt;a href="http://vixra.org"&gt;viXra.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you're not familiar with viXra, it's an alternative to &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/"&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;, which is a preprint server for several types of scientific publications. viXra decided it didn't like the "censorship" practiced by those ebil scientific journals and all those hoity toity types at arXiv (where you have to be vetted by someone in the field before you can upload, so a minimal peer review process), so they started their own club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I bet readers are already groaning anticipating what viXra really is: A home for crackpots. And you'd be right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's guilt by association. Perhaps, &lt;i&gt;just perhaps&lt;/i&gt;, this article is legit. No idea why it wouldn't have been put on arXiv first, but it apparently made it in a real, peer reviewed journal.... right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "&lt;a href="http://journalofcosmology.com/"&gt;Journal of Cosmology&lt;/a&gt;" is a sham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, check out it's "peer review" process:&lt;blockquote&gt;Authors should submit the names, affiliations, and email addresses of 5 scientists qualified to review their paper&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah... that's right. You can pick your own reviewers. It says not to pick "friends", but that doesn't mean you can't pick someone that's not already sympathetic to your position and not going to give it a real shake. That's not peer review. That's cronyism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I've been informed that this is standard practice for some journals, a legitimate journal should at least review the reviewers picked and make sure they the proper qualifications and the job is done. How does this journal do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's take a look at some of the articles. &lt;a href="http://journalofcosmology.com/Cosmology4.html"&gt;Here's one&lt;/a&gt; that the author of the paper BD2 likes to cite. It's about the "Myth of the Big Bang". Here's a quote that sums up the article:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although most cosmologists will deny it, their Big Bang interpretations of data require it: a geo-centric universe with Earth as the center and measure of all things--exactly as demanded by the Judeo-Christian religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wha? The Big Bang is Creationism is disguise?! Then why do so many Creationists have a problem with it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly enough, in this case, the Creationists actually understand the theory &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than the author. The author claims&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, data marshaled in support of the Big Bang place Earth at the center of the universe, with claims of age, distance, expansion, acceleration all relative to where the Earth is now&lt;/blockquote&gt;Uh... no. We use the Earth as a reference frame, but one of the centermost understandings of all of cosmology is that we do so because it's convenient. Not because it's the way things really are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; slip by peer review? I guess the author recommended some elementary school students to review it. Behe would be proud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where does this guy come from and how does he know so much about Cosmology?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, he's from the &lt;a href="http://www.brainresearchlab.com/"&gt;Brain Research Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Oooh.... &lt;i&gt;Research&lt;/i&gt; Lab. Sounds legit. Or not. They don't actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; research. They just produce stuff for the people that do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what about &lt;a href="http://journalofcosmology.com/BigBang101.html"&gt;the original article BD2 referenced&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's rubbish too. And it's not hard to see why. It's essentially the same game Creationists play - If you can poke enough holes in something, it will collapse, so make people think it's full of holes. The author cites numerous studies that attack various points of the Big Bang. Every single one falls flat. They're either things that the author simply doesn't understand (superstructure in the universe), or things that have never been justified (non-Doppler shift interpretations of redshift). His sources are crap too. Aside from the horrid nonsense I already pointed out he likes, he's also citing E.J. Lerner, a plasma cosmology lunatic. But even if they were supported, it provides no converging explanation for anything. Good theories tie many things together. This author thinks he's onto something when everything points in a different direction. Bad science. Bad journal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the other articles don't look too bad (although I've only glanced through a few of them). There's some written by some legitimate scientists actually working in their own fields including the person that started the "journal". In fact, he has quite a few, which is interesting. That's not a conflict of interest at all....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, pretending this "Journal of Cosmology" is a credible source, is a bunch of nonsense. It's horribly and obviously flawed. But then again, so are Creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UPDATE: Nancy, over at Universe Today, has also taken note of how another article fails to meet critical standards from experts in the field. This time on &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/75263/could-a-human-mars-mission-be-funded-commercially/"&gt;sponsoring missions to Mars&lt;/a&gt;. While one could argue that disagreements will always exist in cutting edge fields, the glaring inadequacies of these articles have shown that these aren't just disagreements over uncertain issues. These articles contain fundamental errors at the basic level. I mean, really? Selling property on Mars to fund missions in violation of international treaty? How did that one sneak by?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, it seems like most of the worst articles come from a guy named Rhawn Joseph, who this journal apparently loves and gives a free pass. He's a quack. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/an_amusingly_suspicious_paper.php"&gt;PZ smacked him down last year&lt;/a&gt;. He, or one of his sycophants left a comment on my Big Bang post linking to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl3Uj2UJjPA"&gt;some video about how the Big Bang never happened&lt;/a&gt;. I was going to do a full debunking of it and even downloaded it, but the sheer density of stupidity just hurt too much. I had 4 pages of notes and wasn't even 10 minutes in before scrapping it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8199747379618684655?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286223392172"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/of_course_they_were_quick_to_r.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5edc236738a7c4bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Of course they were quick to respond</title><published>2010-10-04T19:51:57Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T19:51:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ul8TyJ28JoI/of_course_they_were_quick_to_r.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/of_course_they_were_quick_to_r.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The head of the &lt;a href="http://www.academiavita.org/portal.jsp?lang=english"&gt;Pontificia Academia Pro Vita&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;specifically&lt;/i&gt; crazy anti-choice arm of the Catholic Church, has already issued a &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39505379"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/a_surprising_nobel.php"&gt;Nobel Prize awarded to an IVF pioneer&lt;/a&gt;. He's against it, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among his peculiar complaints is the objection that it "didn't treat the underlying problem of infertility but rather skirted it", which is rather odd. This:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Couples can't have children&lt;br&gt;↓&lt;br&gt;Couples use IVF&lt;br&gt;↓&lt;br&gt;Couples now have children&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks to me like a rather direct way to treat infertility. Where they once could have no children, now they have children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also don't like the fact that the procedure produces excess embryos which are then discarded, stored, or used in further research in reproduction. They prefer the natural method of intercourse, which produces excess embryos which are then flushed down the toilet to rot in the sewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The church is also deeply concerned that the technology has produced a market for women to sell a few cells from their ovaries, when everyone knows that women are supposed to be sold whole and intact and dedicate every aspect of their lives to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said the award ignored the ethical questions raised by the fertility treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said IVF had led to the destruction of large numbers of human embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly four million babies have been born using IVF fertility treatment since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Carrasco, the Vatican’s spokesman on bio-ethics, said in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) had been “a new and important chapter in the field of human reproduction”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he said the Nobel prize committee’s choice of Prof Edwards had been “completely out of order” as without his treatment, there would be no market for human eggs “and there would not be a large number of freezers filled with embryos in the world”, he told Italy’s Ansa news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the best of cases they are transferred into a uterus but most probably they will end up abandoned or dead, which is a problem for which the new Nobel prize winner is responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IVF always requires a surplus of eggs, and frequently a surplus of fertilized ones.  Absent religions like Catholicism, which insists on seeing a small ball of cells as an ensouled human, there would be no moral outcry over a procedure like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ludicrous pronouncements like this, against a procedure that has helped so many people, that will spell the end of the Catholic church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/bedbugs-and-pesticide-resistance/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/FTFCO0n1PvM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a wonderful accompanying article at &lt;a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/100901_bedbugs"&gt;Understanding Evolution&lt;/a&gt;.  And, they repeat something that I’ve &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/new-research-on-bedbug-insecticide-resistance/"&gt;tried to explain&lt;/a&gt; in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Like pyrethrums, DDT kills insects by acting on the sodium pores in  their nerve cells — and it just so happens that many of the same  mutations that protect an insect against DDT also happen to protect it  from pyrethrums.  When DDT was first introduced, such mutations were  probably extremely rare.  However, with the widespread use of DDT in the  1950s and 60s, such mutations became much more common among bed bugs  through the process of natural selection. Though DDT is rarely used  today because of its environmental effects, these mutations have stuck  around and are still present in modern bed bug populations.  Because of  the action of natural selection in the past (favoring resistance to  DDT), many bed bug populations today are primed with the right sort of  genetic variation to evolve resistance to pyrethrums rapidly.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dan and I were tagged in one of them recently. I had written a response earlier that basically &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/10/implications-of-book-mistakes-were-made.html"&gt;said this&lt;/a&gt;. After a Christian responded Dan wrote:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, we are all in the same boat. We are all biological organisms with similar brains breathing the same air, looking at the same evidence. There is no evidence for a god, or we would have seen it by now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheism is nothing to be "skeptical of." Atheism makes no claims. It is simply the absence of a claim of theism. Yes, we atheists are skeptical of everything, including our own minds . . . but skepticism is not a conclusion, it is a method. As we apply the method of skepticism to the claims of theism, they all fail .. . no evidence, no good argument, no coherent definition, no possibility of falslfiability, no satisfactory replies to the argument from evil (and other positive arguments against the existence of the traditional god), no agreement among believers as to the nature or moral principles of this "god," and most important: no need for such a belief. Millions of good people lead happy, purposeful, productive, loving, hopeful and moral lives without such a sophomoric belief . . . in things like talking snakes and holy ghosts . . . so what difference does it make? Those who believe will believe (with no evidence or argument) and those who don't believe don't believe. We atheists are not running into churches dragging people of of pews, trying to convert the world to our viewpoint. We simply give answers when asked for our reasons for rejecting gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheism is intellectually and morally respectable. Until theists provide proof, we are justified in withholding our belief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I liked what he said! So true it is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7377976740636196379?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two weeks, yours truly will be participating in the 2010 &lt;a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/trottier-symposium/"&gt;Lorne Trottier Public Science Symposium&lt;/a&gt; at McGill University in Montreal. This year, the theme is Confronting Pseudoscience: A Call to Action. I’ll be speaking with &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com"&gt;Michael Shermer&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, October 18 from 5 to 7 PM on the &lt;a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/trottier-symposium/october18/"&gt;Threat of Pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, October 19, the ever-amazing Randi will &lt;a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/trottier-symposium/october19/"&gt;speak on investigating paranormal claims&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the organizers couldn’t get Randi on the same stage with us because he couldn’t make it to Montreal from &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;TAM London&lt;/a&gt; in time for Monday night; so this is the next best thing. Randi deserves the stage to himself anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I can’t wait, although I must admit that I’m rather nervous. To share the stage with Michael Shermer and Ben Goldacre and to get to hang out with them plus Randi, well, that’s more than I could have hoped for or imagined. It leaves me feeling like Wayne in this clip, with Shermer, Goldacre, and Randi as Alice Cooper (very appropriate, given Randi’s history of having done the effects for Alice Cooper’s stage show back in the 1970s):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you happen to be in the Montreal area or can get there on October 18 and/or 19, come on over to McGill. It’ll be a rousing good skeptical time. I don’t yet know what Ben Goldacre and Michael Shermer will be discussing, but I’ll be speaking about cancer quackery (although I probably won’t be able to resist a brief commentary on quackademic medicine). I’ll also be on &lt;a href="http://www.cjad.com/Shows/TheDrJoeSchwarczShow.aspx"&gt;Dr. Joe’s radio show on CJAD 1010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Using a combination of quick, immediate responses (the innate immune system) and long-term memory (the adaptive immune system) in humans the cells of the immune system are perfectly primed to seek out any cells that are Other (i.e not Self) and kill them.Which leads to a slight problem, because rather a lot of the cells within your body are &amp;#39;Other&amp;#39; cells, and their existence is vital to your health. Within your stomach, and your respiratory tract, live a number of commensal bacteria, friendly and harmless bugs that can survive quite happily inside you and help to fight against incoming pathogenic bacteria. Stripping away the bacteria in the gut (i.e by going on a course of very strong antibiotics) leads to all kinds of problems including digestive problems and, once the antibiotics have finished, increased risk of disease-causing bacteria invading the now bacteria-free stomach.In fact several notable yoghurt making companies are making a lot of money by selling you drinks with bacteria in them. They reassure you that the bacteria aren&amp;#39;t dangerous, which is all well and good, but they never quite explain why the ingestion of many bacteria doesn&amp;#39;t cause your immune system to have a panic attack.A new review in Nature looks at the interactions between the gut microbiome and the immune system. The &amp;#39;gut microbiome&amp;#39; is the collection of bacteria that start colonising the inside of your intestines soon after birth, both from your mother, and from the general environment. It&amp;#39;s helpful here to remember that technically your intestinal tract isn&amp;#39;t actually inside your body. There&amp;#39;s an open tube right the way from your mouth to your arse (for want of a better word...) so the body has a tendency to treat bacteria living there in similar ways to the bacteria living on your skin, by using barriers to keep them out.However there still is a trade off. The cells that make up the intestinal walls still need to be able to respond to bacteria, and the commensal bacteria still need to be contained. A non-regulated population of bacteria will simply keep growing until all available space is filled (and all nutrients eaten), and this does not happen within the gut.Starting with the innate immune system which works by recognising molecules found in all pathogens (called PAMPs) these are recognised by human cells using receptors called TLRs (Toll-like receptors - long story) and lead to a signalling cascade that result in a huge number of cytokines and other inflammatory agents being released to kill the bacteria. In the gut this wouldn&amp;#39;t just lead to the massive slaughter of the microbiome, but also to a huge amount of damage to the surrounding human cells. Enough exposure to microbial elements such as lipopolysacharrides can downregulate this response; the lipopolysacharrides (which are in the bacteria cell wall) down-regulate one of the key components of the signalling system, a molecule called IRAK1. This prevents the cell from mounting a response to the bacteria. For those that want scientific details, check out the diagram below:The adaptive immune system is more complex. In normal situations it works by taking a small sample of the bacteria back to the lymph nodes and preparing a specific immune response against it. Special immune cells (B cells) are then made which will kill the specific bacteria, with the help of T cells, which also act as a memory of the threat and the correct response. The B cells are then sent to the point of infection and secrete antibodies which clump the bacteria into groups and recruit other factors to kill them.This still mostly happens in the case of the gut microbiome, the B cells release the antibody IgA which diffuses out into the intestinal tract and traps the bacteria in the mucus layer. However the bacteria are able to strike back, not by targeting the B cells, but the T cells. There are many different forms of T cells, and by secreting certain chemicals the bacteria can encourage the formation of T-regulatory cells which encourage tolerance towards both commensal bacteria and molecules in food.So it seems to be not so much a relationship of mututal tolerence and understanding, but more like a sort of uneasy standoff. Bacteria are still being killed to stop them spreading, but are holding off the immune systeme enough to maintain a steady population. In return, the immune system is still there and active, but not active enough to cause any serious damage to either the microbiotica or the surrounding human cells.---Cerf-Bensussan N, &amp;amp; Gaboriau-Routhiau V (2010).

The planet's most abundant enzyme is also one of its lousiest. It's RuBisCO, the photosynthetic enzyme that mediates the fixation of CO2 by catalyzing its incorporation into the five carbon ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). Routinely it goofs and incorporates O2 instead, producing the useless and potentially harmful phosphoglycolate, which cells must then expend energy to dispose of. And even if O2 is not around to confuse the enzyme, the Km of cyanobacterial RuBisCO for CO2 is still greater than 150 μM. The CO2 concentration in the aquatic environments where cyanobacteria live is typically less than 15 μM. Cyanobacteria and other RuBisCO-containing bacteria deal with ill-behaved RuBisCO by confining it in microcompartments called carboxysomes. Confinement of RuBisCO turns out to be for its own good, and for the good of the cell as well.

The carboxysome is not your typical membrane-bound organelle....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, as I did for episode 1, I’m giving away some BU swag related to the show. All you have to do is leave a comment on this very post! Well, there are other rules, too, but more on that in a sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the loot [click the pix to embiggen]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/5049147099/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5049147099_4564e63405.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the winner will receive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A signed copy of my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; on which &lt;em&gt;Bad Universe&lt;/em&gt; is based&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A Bad Universe promotional postcard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A glossy color brochure for the U.S. Air Force’s Thunderbirds, with whom I flew for the second episode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Some Thunderbirds stickers – yes, two are missing; I used one my for my car, this is free so deal with it… but the other was used for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A water bottle given to me for the Thunderbirds F-16 flight with one of the above stickers on it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- An &amp;quot;I’m a Bad Astronomer&amp;quot; button from the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedetroit.org/"&gt;New Detroit Science Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cranbrook.edu/"&gt;the Cranbrook Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- A NASA &lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt; planet-finder mission bookmark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A limited-run &lt;a href="http://surlyramics.com/"&gt;Surlyramics&lt;/a&gt; Bad Astronomy necklace with a flying saucer on it, made by my pal Amy Roth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A wind up jiggly-robot thingy that will make sense once you watch the show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A bottle of NASA anti-bacterial hand-gel. Yes, I’m serious, I picked it up at an astronomy meeting from a NASA booth, so it’s official, and why NASA needs it I don’t want to know, especially after making this particular episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and, just for kicks and because they’re the lead in for my show Wednesday night: a ridiculously oversized MythBusters swag bag from Comic Con 2010, featuring My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™ on one side and all 5 ‘busters on the other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/5048583004/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/5048583004_b4d0e51aa8_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;RULES:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you win this great stuff? Here’s the deal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;0)&lt;/strong&gt; This contest is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; This contest is right here in this blog. I’ve done this through Twitter before, but it’s just too hard to track the hashtags, so I’m doing this like the blog contests of old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All you have to do is leave a comment on this post&lt;/strong&gt;. It can say whatever you want (don’t break &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/10/03/comments-policy/"&gt;my commenting rule&lt;/a&gt;, though), as long as you say something. Writing &amp;quot;Phil is awesome&amp;quot; may be true, but won’t increase your odds of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Only leave &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; comment. If you post more than one, I will disqualify you from winning, and I will also infect you with the slime I found at NASA’s Ames Research Center in a jar labeled &amp;quot;DO NOT OPEN&amp;quot; and festooned with skulls and crossbones and biohazard symbols. Trust me here; don’t comment more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You have to use a valid email address when commenting&lt;/em&gt;, because that’s how I will contact you if you win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/4926837694/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4926837694_10a654cd44_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; The contest ends on Wednesday, October 6, at noon Mountain time (18:00 GMT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5)&lt;/strong&gt;  At that time, I’ll generate a random number, and the person with that comment number wins! I’ll notify the winner via email, and they will have until Saturday, October 9, 2010 at 12:00 MT to respond. If I don’t get a response, I’ll pick another random commenter, who will have until Monday at 12:00 MDT, and so on, giving everyone after that two days to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6)&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone on Earth is eligible, except (to be fair) for people who know me in real life. I’ll leave that up to you to decide if you count or not. People who know me can certainly leave a comment, but they cannot win the bounty. Those comments will count in the random numbers I pick (in other words, if my wife comments, I won’t give her the prize, but her comment will be counted in the total number used). Again, please don’t comment more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7)&lt;/strong&gt; Just so’s you know, this is not an official Discover Magazine or Discovery Channel or Bad Universe contest. It’s just me playing around and having some fun. I’m doing this, duh, to promote the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So comment away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in a black hole, where it is supposed to constitute the 'evaporation' of photons across the hole's event horizon, but rather, in a refractive index perturbation style event horizon, in the lab.  It is made in glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... researchers using a CCD camera detected a peculiar kind of photon emission at a 90-degree angle to the glass. ... researchers arranged the experiment in a way to strongly suppress or eliminate other types of radiation.

&lt;p&gt;"Experimental evidence of photon emission that on one hand bears the characteristics of Hawking radiation and on the other is distinguishable and thus separate from other known photon emission mechanisms," the physicists wrote in their study. "We therefore interpret the observed photon emission as an indication of Hawking radiation induced by the analogue event horizon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2010/press.html"&gt;Nobel Prize in Medicine&lt;/a&gt; has gone to Robert G. Edwards for his pioneering work in in vitro fertilization. It surprises me because it&amp;#39;s almost ancient history — he is being rewarded for work done over 30 years ago. It&amp;#39;s also very applied research — this was not work that greatly advanced our understanding of basic phenomena in biology, because IVF was already being done in animals. This was just the extension of a technique to one peculiar species, ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't begrudge him the award, though, because the other special property of his research was that it was &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; controversial. These were procedures that simply burned through scores (or hundreds, if you count the ones with such little viability that they weren&amp;#39;t implanted) of human zygotes in order to work out reliable protocols, and throughout faced serious ethical risks — these were procedures that had a chance of producing the worst possible result, a viable embryo that came to full term, but had serious birth defects. The public opposition to the work was tremendous, funding was tenuous, and even many in the scientific community opposed the work and ostracized Edwards and his colleague, Steptoe (who did not live to see this day, and so did not receive the award).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, IVF is practically routine and about 4 million people were 'test tube babies'. It's still controversial, though, with extremist anti-abortion groups, such as the Catholic church, still fighting it, and the redundant, unused zygotes from the procedure still being a point of major contention (ever heard of 'snowflake babies'? That's what they're talking about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm reading a couple of messages in this award. One is simply acknowledging a hard-working scientist, but the other is a signal that we should soldier on through all of the opposition to reproductive health technologies, that science will be rewarded and the Luddites will find themselves in the dustbin of history. I can't help but see this as, in part, the Nobel committee making an unmistakeably rude gesture at the anti-science, anti-choice fanatics of the religious right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For those who are unfamilar with the IVF procedure that Edwards and Steptoe developed, here's a lovely summary diagram from the Nobel Foundation.)&lt;/p&gt;

An octillion tons of gas blasted outwards at speeds of thousands of kilometers per second, forming tendrils and wisps as it raced away. At the center of the conflagration, the core of the star had collapsed into an ultradense object called a neutron star. It has the mass of the Sun crammed into a ball only 20 – 30 km (12 – 18 miles) across, and is spinning at a rate of 30 times per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this happened a long time ago. The debris is what we now call the Crab Nebula, and is one of the best-studied objects in the sky. And that’s a good thing, because even now the Crab is capable of throwing tantrums… and we can see it when it does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/~deluca/crab2010/crab-2010.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_crab_sep2010.jpg" alt="hst_crab_sep2010" title="hst_crab_sep2010" width="610" height="453"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=2903"&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt; is a brand spanking new shot of the heart of the Crab Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. And by new, I mean it was taken on Saturday, October 2! It’s a bit hard to see what’s going on, so I created an annotated version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_crab_sep2010_ann.jpg" alt="hst_crab_sep2010_ann" title="hst_crab_sep2010_ann" width="610" height="453"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pulsar is labeled. It’s sitting right at the center of the gas cloud, which extends way beyond the edges of this picture. As the pulsar spins, it emits a fast stream of particles that act like a wind, compressing the gas in the nebula and creating those circles of light. They look elliptical because the whole system is tilted, and you’re seeing it like a DVD held at an angle. From what I can tell, the bottom left is the side toward us, and the upper right is farther away, as if we’re looking down on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-September, just a couple of weeks ago, several orbiting observatories noted that there was an increased amount of gamma rays coming from this part of the sky. Gamma rays are the highest energy form of light, and there aren’t many sources in the sky that can create them at all, let alone in quantities that can be seen. The Crab is the brightest continuous gamma-ray source we know, and so it was immediately put on the Most Wanted list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://seds.org/messier/more/m001_hst.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/hst_crab_dec1993.jpg" alt="hst_crab_dec1993" title="hst_crab_dec1993" width="300" height="276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hubble was quickly pointed at the pulsar, and that image above was taken. Now note the rectangular bit to the left of the pulsar. Some of that stuff was seen in earlier images, but not this bright! You can compare it to &lt;a href="http://seds.org/messier/more/m001_hst.html"&gt;the image on the right, taken in December 1993 by Hubble&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ve rotated and scaled to be close to what we see in the new image. The overall structure is very roughly the same, but clearly that gas to the left is brighter in the new image. I suspect that rectangular structure in the new image is actually a ring, the shape distorted by density variations in the gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What must have happened [note: I'm conjecturing here and may be way off, but the basic stuff is probably correct] is that something occurred on the pulsar: maybe it had a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/18/ok-so-maybe-we-can-be-a-little-frightened/"&gt;starquake&lt;/a&gt;, or a bit of material fell on it (the crushing gravity of a neutron star guarantees that anything hitting it will be doing so at a &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; fraction of the speed of light, generating a lot of explosive energy; even a marshmallow hitting at that speed explodes like an atomic bomb!). But something violent happened, and a blast of gamma-rays ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsars like this have incredibly strong magnetic fields, and this can affect how matter and energy flow from the star. Apparently, a lot of this energy was directed out the poles of the star. Focused in this way, a beam of high-energy particles and energy slammed into the gas surrounding the star, lighting it up, and generating an expanding wave of pressure which created that rectangular ring, like a snowplow piling up snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is the case in part due to the ring of material on the other side of the pulsar, which I marked with a dotted line. That too must be due to energy flowing out of the star’s pole. How do I know? Because if that ring were in the plane of the other circles of gas we see, &lt;em&gt;it would be centered on the pulsar&lt;/em&gt;; literally, the pulsar would appear to be right in the center of the ring. But it’s not, it’s off-center, indicating the ring is not in that same plane. From the geometry we see, it must be &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; that other material, so it must have been due to material coming from the star’s poles, not its equator. For the same reason, the material on the other side — the new stuff — must be due to something happening at the other pole of the star as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly, that rectangle/loop was there &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; this recent flare of gamma-rays occurred; it’s way too big to have been created in the past two weeks! It’s probably been there for years, carved by steady emission from the star’s pole, and this new flare lit it up. Note too that if you start at the pulsar and go through that loop, you can see a very faint arc of material even farther out (labeled in that second image). That’s just what you’d expect if a beam of matter was pouring out of the star’s pole and plowing through the surrounding gas. That arc is a shock wave where that beam ends and is ramming that material in the nebula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/12/06/crabby-hubble/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2005/crab_hst.jpg" width="175" height="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now, this all these descriptions may sound a little dry, but remember what you’re seeing here. The above Hubble image shows a region trillions of kilometers across, tens of thousands of times larger than our entire solar system. And the energies involved are vast and numbing: in gamma rays alone, &lt;em&gt;the Crab emits thousands of times the Sun’s total energy!&lt;/em&gt; In other words, put the Crab pulsar where the Sun is now, and we’d be cooked in seconds just from gamma rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this new flare of gamma rays from the Crab doubled the intensity for several days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crab is a fantastically complicated place, with a lot going on at once. It’s hard sometimes to know what’s what. But we do get hints, and we’re getting a glimpse of its three-dimensional structure, providing essential clues to the events we’re witnessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too: stars like these are what create nearly all the elements in the Universe besides hydrogen and helium. The iron in your blood and calcium in your bones came from stars like this that exploded billions of years ago. When we study objects like the Crab, we’re learning not just about astronomy, but literally about where we came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berry has recently posted an account of &lt;a href="http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/665027/Evolution-Pilgrimage.html"&gt;his mountaineering homage to Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;: a combined climbing/backpacking expedition with another evolutionist.  The team ascended Mounts Darwin, Wallace, and Lamarck in the Sierra Nevada. His account includes interesting information on how these mountains got their names (others in the range include Mounts Huxley, Spencer, and Mendel).  Berry is unenthusiastic about the suggestion (seriously) that another peak in the range be named Mount (Stephen Jay) Gould; he favors Mount [R. A.] Fisher instead.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, time to look at it again. It's (relatively) little known that a long list of mammal species possess an assortment of 'pouches', pocket-like structures and pneumatic sacs and spaces within their throats, skulls, chests, and sometimes on their palates. Some of these are air-filled, epithelium-lined structures that originate as outgrowths of the throat or windpipe, and are hence known as diverticula (singular: diverticulum) [image below shows Siamang Symphalangus syndactylus (from wikipedia) with inflated throat pouch, and a diagrammatic great ape showing the extent of the laryngeal pouches (based on a diagram in Meldrum (2006)].

As someone interested in pneumaticity, the mechanics and anatomy of respiration and vocalising, and in sheer weirdness, I've been planning for ages to write some articles that summarise our knowledge of these structures. It's a fairly big subject, so I ended up writing quite a lot: this article is part 1 of a series of several.

A blog about language gets, as you might expect, a few fairly repetitive responses to common issues, and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2683"&gt;Language Log gets lots of unimaginative comments about ending a sentence with a preposition&lt;/a&gt;…and they&amp;#39;ve reached the limits of their patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to bear any longer the tedious work of seeking out all the instances of these two dopey comment types and deleting them, I have decided that from now on I will hunt down the relevant commenters and kill them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I realize that it is unusual for a popular science blog to launch upon a policy of killing its own readers. That is why I thought an explicit warning should go up on the site first. This is that warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there is now a precedent, I will happily follow suit. I have a few peeves of my own that I think will have to be treated with the death penalty to all offenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man waiting for rescue from a flood "joke". No, I will not repeat it. And remember, if you try to repeat it in the comments, it is now a killing offense. (If you really need to know what it is, it's in my book.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any statement about how science is just another religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any thread about the problems women face in our culture, any man who starts crying about his poor butchered foreskin will join it in the biological waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any claim that &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/10/no-brainer.html"&gt;atheists ignore the 'sophisticated' claims of theists&lt;/a&gt; without telling us exactly what those brilliant neglected arguments are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will certainly be others added to this list, because I am capricious and vindictive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Pullum has contracted out the termination job to two of his staffers, Luca and Enzo. I do not employ "people" with sufficient autonomy to have warranted names, but instead will be dispatching the faceless (literally) molluscan horde to take care of the condemned. A suggestion: if you receive a death sentence, head for the nearest seacoast and wait for the tentacles to arise; they're savage, quick, and painless. Trying to hide in landlocked areas means you'll be taken care of by the snails and slugs, which means execution by slow, painful radulation.&lt;/p&gt;

When the law caught up with him even in that remote place, he fled…&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/869928--fifteen-year-search-for-pedophile-canadian-priest-ends-with-him-going-free"&gt;and guess where he found shelter and employment&lt;/a&gt;? Back in the arms of Mother Church, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Belgian-born priest, who became a Canadian citizen in 1977, is wanted for three counts of indecent assault on a male and three counts of buggery for incidents involving minors and alleged to have occurred between 1978 and 1982 in Igloolik. These charges were laid after he completed a five-year sentence in April of 1995 (a penitentiary stint, a halfway house then probation) for abusing children in Baker Lake, then part of the Northwest Territories, now part of Nunavut. Dejaeger left Canada before his first court date in June of 1995 and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Six years later, the Interpol red alert was circulated. Nine years after that, in May of this year, Belgian journalist Douglas De Coninck published an article detailing Dejaeger's life on the lam. The priest worked with pilgrims in Lourdes and participated in masses. A member of the Oblate Order of Mary Immaculate, he was living at the order's villa in Blanden. Several months after the article appeared, Dejaeger voluntarily turned himself in at the Leuven police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Belgian police just turned him loose again, stating that there was no extradition order from Canada. He's on the run again. Given his history, I can guess where we'll find him: turn over a few churches, and he'll be found nestling amongst the friendly priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's not just blame religion! There's also another nasty story here, of secular authorities turning a blind eye to his activities. He'd been brought before a Canadian judge who didn't seem to think Dejaeger was such a bad fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly, Justice Ted Richard of the Northwest Territories Supreme Court wrote in his sentence decision that Dejaeger was not a pedophile even though "it does not appear that he stopped this activity on his own but only when he was caught." It's unclear how he was caught.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dejaeger admitted to, among other sexual acts, having anal intercourse with boys and digital vaginal penetration with girls. Yet Richard seemed to praise the priest's restraint:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Because of the age of the victims of these assaults, consent is not an issue or a factor to be considered. However, it should be noted in fairness to the offender here that no violence was used in committing these assaults," Richard wrote 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priests don't use violence, usually. They've got the shackles of tradition and dogma to hold their victims down for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course the real crime here is that these monsters in dog collars were dumped on the native peoples of Canada to rip their way through several generations, and there is no sign of remorse for that from the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/from_nunavut_to_lourdes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/MjWiiMpoxqg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286210892568"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/finally_someone_tells_the_trut.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a3acc9462229d08</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Finally, someone tells the truth about me</title><published>2010-10-04T15:39:49Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T15:39:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/vwacwA_ppfs/finally_someone_tells_the_trut.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/finally_someone_tells_the_trut.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One more "he's such a teddy bear" and I am going to set my beard on fire and howl.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard,  	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My non-religious (as of yet) kids (ages eleven and eight) go to my in-law’s church occasionally when they stay over Saturday night. They then attend the Sunday school portion with their rather religious cousins. When they get home, we  discuss what they talked about and they are welcome to ask me or my husband questions about it. I figure it is a good way to get them exposed directly to  other ways of thinking and to what the majority of our community thinks about  life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the kids were told about hell and god’s wrath and such like, not  really a big deal for our kids since they have no belief in an afterlife at this  point, making hell impossible.   	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last week, they were told that evolution is a lie. Straight out, a lie. I  was horrified. My gut reaction was, “They are never going there again.”  But, then my eleven-year-old son said the youth leader had been talking about the 10  commandments and about how you can’t lie and said he thought  it was funny that  the group leader then lied to all the kids about evolution not having any  fossils to back it up. So I think my son caught on pretty quickly that what they  are hearing is not necessarily the truth. But my eight-year-old daughter is less likely  to confront the words of an authority figure in such a blatant manner. I  personally draw the religious tolerance line at direct lies and  misrepresentation of basic scientific tools, especially when it comes to life  sciences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am having a really, really hard time balancing my worldview with that of my  in-laws without insulting the one they hear in this church. I don’t want my kids  to think less of these people, but how do I do that when the man stands up there and spouts ignorance at them?  	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up talking about all the evidence that does back up evolution and why  the Sunday school leader might have gotten the impression that it doesn’t. Then we also talked about how a person in authority does not necessarily have the  correct answers and that you can’t trust someone based solely on the fact that  they are in a position of authority. And that same statement goes for science as  well. Every statement should be questioned if it seems out of place with the  natural world.  	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the lesson they learned at Sunday school was to not blindly accept what they are told, not even from their teachers or their parents. Not really the lesson I  wanted them to get at such a young age, but I am not sure what else I could have  said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think going to church with their grandparents is a good idea, but how am I supposed to teach my kids religious tolerance when the religious make such  untenable statements? How do I keep my kids (or myself for that matter) from  feeling superior and likely set aside from the rest of our community?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for you time,&lt;br&gt;
Laurie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Laurie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your kids are going to be fine. They have a superb teacher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you’ve been handling things very well. The discussions you have been having about what they heard at the church have been excellent. You are teaching them good habits of critical thinking, including being willing to question a claim by science just as closely as a claim by religion. Good for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry too much about their learning to even question your knowledge. You are building a relationship with them based on respect and honesty. In the long run, that will give you much more credibility in their eyes than a relationship based on the authority of force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I printed your entire letter because so much of it is good advice for parents in a similar situation. The only parts where I see you’re uncomfortable are in these two statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am having a really, really hard time balancing my worldview with that of my in-laws without insulting the one they hear in this church. I don’t want my kids  to think less of these people, but how do I do that when the man stands up there and spouts ignorance at them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…but how am  I supposed to teach my kids religious tolerance when the religious make such  untenable statements? How do I keep my kids (or myself for that matter) from  feeling superior and likely set aside from the rest of our community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By watching you as well as listening to you, this is what I think your children are learning at their own levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is what you think of a person’s beliefs, and then there’s how you treat that person. You can consider their beliefs to be ridiculous, yet you don’t have to put effort into openly ridiculing the person. You can lack respect for their beliefs, yet you can still treat the person respectfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of religious tolerance I think you want your kids to practice consists of three things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting civil rights: Refraining from interfering with the free belief and practice of someone else’s religion, as long as that practice does not violate civil law.
&lt;li&gt;General respectful conduct: Refraining from unnecessary, out-of-context, cruel or humiliating ridicule or derision of someone’s religious beliefs.
&lt;li&gt;Discretion: Knowing when to challenge a religious claim and when to disregard it; who to confront, and who to quietly abide; knowing when to call something a lie, when to call it ignorance, and whether or not either course is worth it; knowing how to balance principles, prudence and pragmatics in each case. Discretion is an on-going, lifelong lesson. We learn it from wise teachers and from painful mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious tolerance does not require making concessions to, or allowing lower standards for claims and practices that are either absurd or harmful. It does not require pretending agreement.  Those are optional behaviors that are about dealing with the social situation at hand. The skill of discretion helps us find our way through the ambiguous, never cut-and-dry complexities of delicate relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think your two kids are already picking up on these distinctions by simply watching you interact with their grandparents, and then having those excellent discussions later at home. They’re realizing that disagreeing with their grandparents’ beliefs is not the same as “insulting” their grandparents.  They can see that finding the ever-shifting balance of truthfulness and kindness is important to you, and so it will be important to them as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t want them to “think less of these people.” Well, it’s inevitable that they’re going to think less of their &lt;em&gt;opinions,&lt;/em&gt; but they don’t have to think less of them as &lt;em&gt;persons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to keep them from feeling superior and likely set aside from the rest of your community. Well, their &lt;em&gt;method of thinking&lt;/em&gt; is superior, and they’re &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; different from the community. You just don’t want them to act like snobs, or to think that they are intrinsically superior beings in every way.  As they grow and interact with the community, they will try out different stances, and some may be a bit over the top.  Because of your respect-based relationship with them, you will be able to gently admonish them if they get too big for their britches, and they will make a correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will come a time when the difference between what you are teaching them and what they’re hearing at church will be stretched to its limit, and then I think it will be time to let them stay home. They’ll probably tell you when they’ve reached that point. You will have exposed them enough to religious ideas and that way of thinking, and as they grow to teens and then adults, they will have valuable skills for constructively dealing with the religious people around them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, you are a superb teacher for them. The best teachers want their students to &lt;em&gt;surpass&lt;/em&gt; them. Be open and ready for learning lessons of wisdom from &lt;em&gt;them.&lt;/em&gt; Of the many joys of parenting, that is one of the best.  &lt;/p&gt;

This one came out last year, but I didn’t have a chance to read it until more recently. In short, it’s a fantastic example of science written for broad audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grinnell  describes how real life researchers bring their own interests and  passions to their work. Through the discovery process, they try to learn  new things about the world. Through the credibility process, they try  to convince other scientists that what they have learned is correct.  Diversity of interests and backgrounds amongst researchers enhances both  discovery and credibility. Achieving success depends on intuition and  commitment as well as on logic and objectivity. Grinnell scratches the  surface of the anonymous and somewhat boring “scientific method” and  shows readers the excitement, risk and adventure underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grinnell does a wonderful job of making science relevant to those outside of a so-called academic bubble who are interested to learn more about the process. He also provides a multidimensional view of who scientists are and what drives them. Not surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195064577?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195064577"&gt;Everyday Practice of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was chosen to receive the &lt;a title="Royal Society Prize for Science Books" href="http://royalsociety.org/science-books/"&gt;Royal Society Prize for Science Books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of interest to intersection readers, Grinnell eloquently closes with a piece on humility and the relationship between science and religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the global level of poverty, disease, and depletion of environmental resources, I worry that the scientific attitude conflates power with progress. Perhaps solving global problems will require scientific and religious attitudes–both types of faith–rather than one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For healthy and relatively young (31) people like me, my personal benefit from getting the flu shot is in many ways less than the net benefit incurred by other more vulnerable people in the population.  There is a huge societal benefit to having as many people get flu shots as possible, whereas my personal benefit is more modest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I understand it, co-pays don't directly affect insurance companies' bottom lines all that much.  (Instead, they make their profit by denying coverage as often as possible, but that's a separate rant)  The main purpose of co-pays is to make it so that the insured has a personal cost as well, with the idea being that they will be less likely to get unnecessary treatments.  In other words, it is an attempt to bring the insured's personal cost-benefit tradeoff more in line with the overall cost-benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for a treatment in which there is a major positive externality, a co-pay is just ridiculous.  You're moving the insured's personal cost-benefit tradeoff in the &lt;i&gt;wrong direction&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be honest, I'm baffled that insurance companies don't voluntarily fix this.  Surely, getting all of their insured to get flu shots would reduce their overall costs?  But if the insurance companies won't do it, the gov't should.  It should not be legal for a health insurance company to charge a co-pay for a flu shot, or for any type of vaccination for that matter.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2207904144025964176?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286202151453"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=12854">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f54a876942f5f52d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Culture"/><title type="html">It’s Book Week at The Intersection!</title><published>2010-10-04T14:22:18Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T14:22:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/10/04/its-book-week-at-the-intersection/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Picture 2" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/files/2010/10/Picture-2.png" alt="Picture 2" width="176" height="186"&gt;Over the summer we’ve received many, many books, but between traveling and personal commitments have had little time for reviewing them.

They make skin itch. And NOTHING is worse than itchy skin. 

But...

Do you know WHERE the fleas are? Where they like to hang out and guard their little flea eggs? Where's the best place for a flea to get a decent night's sleep, or a delicious snack? These are important questions. Lucky for us, Hsu, Hsu, and Wu of the Department of Entomology at National Taiwan University have the answers. And this paper, dear readers, is pure blogging GOLD.

Now, if you wanted to find out what areas of the cat body fleas prefer to call home, you might think that you could just drive around and look for dead cats (as long as they haven't been dead for too long), and assess the infestation. But you'd be wrong, because although cat fleas almost NEVER leave their host cats - even when the flea population on one cat exceeds 300 individuals - as soon as it becomes clear that the cat is beginning to die, they pack their bags and take off, and begin the nomadic search for a new cat. You might also think that you could try to get cat owners to bring their pet cats in to your lab, but there's a problem there too: most cat owners (at least, the responsible ones) give their cats anti-flea treatments and keep them groomed and bathed, which means that pet cats wouldn't have that many fleas. By now, you might expect that you know the answer: trap living stray cats, bring them to the lab, assess the infestation, and then return the stray cat to the location where it was caught in the first place.

Stray cats were live trapped in cat traps that had a single door and that were baited with fried chicken.

&lt;p&gt;Normally, while very cool, that’s not the sort of thing I’d write about here. But I had an idle moment, and wondered about what that rotation really meant. I did a little math, and came up with some astonishing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Graphen.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/graphene.jpg" alt="graphene" title="graphene" width="300" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First off, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene"&gt;graphene&lt;/a&gt; is a flat sheet made up of carbon atoms; each atom connects to the others in a hexagon pattern, and the sheet is only one atom thick! This sheet is incredibly strong, and scientists are excited by it because if it can be produced on a large scale it would have tremendous use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the scientists created tiny flakes of it only a micron (one-millionth of a meter) across; that’s about 1/50th the width of a human hair. They suspended the flakes in a chamber using electric fields, then spun them up using a beam of light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started picturing what that must be like, these tiny whirling motes of carbon, and realized that the forces on a spinning flake must be huge. And by huge, I mean &lt;em&gt;monstrous&lt;/em&gt;. When you spin, you feel a force called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force"&gt;the centripetal force&lt;/a&gt;. It’s what you feel when you’re on a merry-go-round, or a car making a turn (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/08/30/when-i-say-centrifugal-i-mean-centrifugal/"&gt;it’s the same thing as centrifugal force&lt;/a&gt;, just seen in a different way). The magnitude of this force, how strong it is, depends on how fast you’re moving, and how big a circle you’re making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to calculate the size of the force on a flake. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As it spins, the corners are making the biggest circles, so they have the highest centripetal force on them. To make things easy, let’s assume the distance from the center of the flake to a corner is one micron. We need the velocity of the corner as it spins, which is the distance traveled divided by the time. Well, it makes a complete circle once per one-millionth of a second. And the distance is the circumference of the circle it makes, which is 2 x π x radius. That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt; velocity =  2 x π x radius / time = 2  x π x 1 micron / 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds = &lt;strong&gt;6.3 meters per second&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s only about 20 feet/second, or roughly 15 mph. I can bike faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, remember, we’re talking about an object smaller than a human hair! So that’s a tremendous speed. The force on it is incredible. Centripetal acceleration&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / radius&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;(6.3 meters/second)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 1 micron = &lt;strong&gt;4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; meter/second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a lot, &lt;strong&gt;it is&lt;/strong&gt;: the acceleration of gravity on the Earth’s surface is about 10 meter/second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the outwards force you’d feel on that flake would be about &lt;em&gt;four million times the Earth’s gravity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea of how much force that is, I weigh about 170 pounds. If I were under that kind of acceleration, it would feel like hanging from a rope… with a fully loaded oil tanker tied to my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost anything on Earth would fly apart at that kind of acceleration, but graphene is just that strong. In fact, the scientists involved said it could withstand even higher speeds! So you can probably get an idea of why this stuff is so cool, and why it might have some interesting applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking roller coasters. You wouldn’t even need seat belts to keep people in their seats… but you’d need spatulas to get them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; I switched to acceleration here because it makes the math and the explanation a bit easier. In the end I’ve been careful about terminology –acceleration and force are related but different —  and I apologize for any confusion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's walk in the woods near Drevinge garnered us the following:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shaggy ink cap, &lt;i&gt;Fjällig bläcksvamp, Coprinus comatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terracotta hedgehog, &lt;em&gt;Rödgul taggsvamp, Hydnum rufescens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shingled hedgehog, &lt;em&gt;Fjällig taggsvamp, Sarcodon imbricatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common puffball, &lt;em&gt;Vårtig röksvamp, Lycoperdon perlatum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velvet bolete, &lt;em&gt;Sandsopp, Suillus variegatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copper brittlegill, &lt;em&gt;Tegelkremla, Russula decolorans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birch bolete, &lt;em&gt;Björksopp, Leccinum scabrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never picked the ink caps before as I knew that the Common ink cap is poisonous at least in combination with alcohol. But now I know better. The shaggies are always plentiful around here!

&lt;p&gt;This autumn holds a small anniversary for me and my wife. She moved in with me in January of 2000. In September of that year we bought a mushroom spotter's guide and wrote both our names in it. Arguably, a couple can't really get any more married than that. And now we've used the book for ten years!

While the genetic link found in this study has been somewhat overhyped in the media, the results are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with media reporting is that they tend to oversimplify the concept of a genetic disorder. The worst offenders speak of “the gene” for whatever is being discussed, like ADHD. There are purely genetic disorders that are the result of a mutation in a single gene, but more often diseases and disorders that have a genetic component are the complex result of multiple genes and their interaction with the environment. Therefore there is no single gene for ADHD, autism, migraines, obesity or other complex condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that there is a “genetic link” to a disorder is more reasonable, but always must be put into context. What this study shows is an increased risk of copy number variants (CNVs) in people with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD. A CNV is either a deletion or duplication of genetic material. The researchers found that 78 out of 1047 control had such CNVs (7%), while 57 out of 366 subjects with ADHD did (15%). This was a statistically significant increase. Further, CNV were more likely to occur on genes previous associated with both autism and schizophrenia (and therefore likely to be involved in brain development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide genetic evidence of an increased rate of large CNVs  in individuals with ADHD and suggest that ADHD is not purely a social  construct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That conclusion needs to be parsed very carefully – they are saying that this study is evidence that ADHD is not purely social. They are not saying that it is purely or even mostly genetic. In fact, only 15% of subjects with ADHD demonstrated increased CNVs. This study is a proof of concept more than anything, demonstrating that genetic makeup can contribute, at least in some cases, to the clinical syndrome of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense in light of our understanding of similar neurological disorders. Many such disorders are defined clinically by a collection signs and symptoms, which in turn relate to some particular function or functions of the brain. However, there are likely to be many underlying causes (from a neuro-anatomical point of view) of such altered function. In other words, there may be many underlying alterations of brain function that lead to the final common pathway that results in the recognized signs and symptoms. Many neurological syndromes are defined by that final common pathway, not the underlying disorder that led to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so complex syndromes like ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia are likely many underlying disorders all with a similar clinical manifestation that we recognize and name. It is helpful to understand what the nature of the clinical manifestation is, specifically with respect to whether it is mostly a construct of environment or an effect of brain development and hard-wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the plausibility that ADHD can be a problem of brain development, genetically determined. The fact that only 15% of subjects showed the genetic changes the researchers were looking for does not mean that the other 85% have no genetic link – they could have other genetic changes that this study was not designed to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have also shown genetic alterations in some subjects with ADHD (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20862695"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;). Researchers are also beginning to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059031"&gt;identify genetic subtypes&lt;/a&gt; that may respond better to certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still a long way from understanding the relevant genetics, but it is reasonable to say that genetic research into ADHD has been fruitful and is likely to continue to bear fruit.

While the genetic link found in this study has  been somewhat overhyped in the media, the results are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  main problem with media reporting is that they tend to oversimplify the  concept of a genetic disorder. The worst offenders speak of “the gene”  for whatever is being discussed, like ADHD. There are purely genetic  disorders that are the result of a mutation in a single gene, but more  often diseases and disorders that have a genetic component are the  complex result of multiple genes and their interaction with the  environment. Therefore there is no single gene for ADHD, autism,  migraines, obesity or other complex condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that there  is a “genetic link” to a disorder is more reasonable, but always must be  put into context. What this study shows is an increased risk of copy  number variants (CNVs) in people with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD. A  CNV is either a deletion or duplication of genetic material. The  researchers found that 78 out of 1047 control had such CNVs (7%), while  57 out of 366 subjects with ADHD did (15%). This was a statistically  significant increase. Further, CNV were more likely to occur on genes  previous associated with both autism and schizophrenia (and therefore  likely to be involved in brain development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our  findings provide genetic evidence of an increased rate of large CNVs   in individuals with ADHD and suggest that ADHD is not purely a social   construct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That conclusion needs to be parsed very  carefully – they are saying that this study is evidence that ADHD is not  purely social. They are not saying that it is purely or even mostly  genetic. In fact, only 15% of subjects with ADHD demonstrated increased  CNVs. This study is a proof of concept more than anything, demonstrating  that genetic makeup can contribute, at least in some cases, to the  clinical syndrome of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense in light of our  understanding of similar neurological disorders. Many such disorders are  defined clinical by a collection signs and symptoms, which in turn  relate to some particular function or functions of the brain. However,  there is likely to be many underlying causes (from a neuro-anatomical  point of view) of such altered function. In other words, there may be  many underlying alterations of brain function that lead to the final  common pathway that results in the recognized signs and symptoms. Many  neurological syndromes are defined by that final common pathway, not the  underlying disorder that lead to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so complex syndromes  like ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia are likely many underlying  disorders all with a similar clinical manifestation that we recognize  and name. It is helpful to understand what the nature of the clinical  manifestation is, specifically with respect to whether it is mostly a  construct of environment or an effect of brain development and  hard-wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the plausibility that ADHD can  be a problem of brain development, genetically determined. The fact that  only 15% of subjects showed the genetic changes the researchers were  looking for does not mean that the other 85% have no genetic link – they  could have other genetic changes that this study was not designed to  detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have also shown genetic alterations in some subjects with ADHD (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20862695"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;). Researchers are also beginning to&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059031"&gt; identify genetic subtypes&lt;/a&gt; that may respond better to certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We  are still a long way from understanding the relevant genetics, but it  is reasonable to say that genetic research into ADHD has been fruitful  and is likely to continue to bear fruit. But the picture that is  emerging (as with many other disorders) is that of a complex  relationship among many genes and interaction with the environment. This  makes it complex to talk about what “causes” ADHD (which itself is  likely not a single discrete entity). This further means that accurately  reporting about ADHD research requires some nuance and care – something  which seems to be on the wane in science journalism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286190789833"><id gr:original-id="http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2010/10/article-review-importance-of-first.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ba6d09f7ce8afe5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Article review: Importance of first clinical clerkship</title><published>2010-10-04T06:00:04Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T06:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/GNkA_HLWWAA/article-review-importance-of-first.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2010/10/article-review-importance-of-first.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">What was your first clinical clerkship rotation?Oddly, I started my third year with a sub-internship rotation on the Burn/Plastics service as my first rotation. Not sure how that happened... I managed my own patients like a 4th year student, did lots of wound care, and even got to harvest a few skin grafts. It was trial by fire.In a recent JAMA article, 3rd year medical students who started their clinical experiences in an Internal Medicine rotation overall did better on overall clerkship grades, when compared those who started their rotations on the Ob/Gyn, Psychiatry, or Family Medicine service.These 3rd year medical students were spread across four distinct sites at the University of Illinois (Chicago, Peoria, Rockford, Urbana). An analysis of covariance was used to test for differences between groups. In this case, differences in the first clerkship rotation were compared with respect to:NBME shelf exam scores (score range 0-100)Student clinical performance ratings (score range 12-30)Overall 3rd year clerkship grades (score range 12-30)USMLE Step 2 exam scoresResultsInterestingly, students who began their 3rd year clerkships with Internal Medicine fared better on the NBME exams (p&amp;lt;0.001) and clerkship grades (p=0.02) during their entire 3rd year.Specifically, they performed better than students who began their rotations with such specialties, such as Ob/Gyn, Psychiatry, and Family Medicine. Clinical performance ratings and USMLE Step 2 scores, however, were not associated with the the student&amp;#39;s first clinical clerkship. It seems that the Internal Medicine rotation provides a crucial foundation in preparing for other clerkships. It is the best first clerkship for students just starting their clinical rotations.Hmm, I wonder...There has been a lot of talk about significantly reorganizing in the U.S. medical school curriculum. Much hype has focused on incorporating more clinical experiences as early as the 1st year of medical school. This study seems to suggest that students should all start with Internal Medicine as their first clinical experience. This, however, is logistically impossible because of limited space on the Internal Medicine teams.This begs the question - Why DO students have to start medical school at the same time each year? Why can&amp;#39;t medical schools enroll students on a rolling basis, such as on the 1st day of each month? This would allow a more equivalent clinical clerkship experience, because students can now follow the same sequence of clerkships. Everyone could start with Internal Medicine.ReferenceKies SM, Roth V, &amp;amp; Rowland M (2010).

&lt;p&gt;One type says "I think a preposition is a fine thing to end a sentence with!", or words very much to that effect (unaware that instances of this lame "look-I'm-violating-the-rule" joke have been going on since at least the 1700s).  The other type says, "This is nonsense up with which I shall not put!" (invariably thinking that they are quoting Sir Winston Churchill, though Ben Zimmer &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001715.html"&gt;definitively refuted that misattribution years ago&lt;/a&gt; in a post that Mark and I subsequently &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590280555/"&gt;included in our book&lt;/a&gt;, and it is enormously annoying to us that still no one is aware of Ben's discovery). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to bear any longer the tedious work of seeking out all the instances of these two comment types so I can delete them, I have decided that from now on I will hunt down the relevant commenters and kill them.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that it is unusual for a popular science blog to launch upon a policy of killing its own readers.  That is why I thought an explicit warning should go up on the site first.  This is that warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, if you are going to post either of the two sorts of comments I have just described, please supply your actual name and residential address so I or Language Log security staffpersons Luca and Enzo can track you down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that there may be some legal issues with this policy, and some believe that death is too harsh a punishment for Language Log writers to be handing out without a full inquiry into whether the person was over the age of 12, whether they were drunk at the time of commenting, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the "let-everyone-have-their-say" softies who criticize my policy have no idea just how many boring self-satisfied twits have posted almost exactly the same thing over and over again down the years.  Yes, death is a severe sanction.  But I think people should look at things from my point of view. It is really irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind also that both kinds of commenter think that they are being enormously clever and witty and original. This is frightening: remember, these morons are out there somewhere, ready to get seated next to you at a dinner party or on a plane and bore you senseless.  Under my new policy this danger will steadily decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am not going to open up a forum on my policy here.  It is over and done with [yes, I know, that's a stranded preposition, but don't even think about a joke comment!]; I have decided, and that is that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

This is particularly true for trials that test modalities that, on the basic science grounds alone, can be dismissed as so highly implausible and with such a low prior probability of success that it is unethical to subject patients to risk with close to zero potential for benefit. Perhaps the most egregious example of such a clinical trial is the Gonzalez protocol in pancreatic cancer, a cornucopia of woo and quackery including up to 150 supplements a day, various dietary interventions, and coffee enemas. When the results were finally reported over a year ago, four years after the trial ended, to no one's surprise (at least no one with at least a modicum of scientific knowledge) the results not only showed that the Gonzalez protocol produced inferior results to those of science-based medicine (SBM), but it wasn't even close. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/the_gonzalez_protocol_worse_than_useless.php"&gt;Patients in the conventional medicine arm lived three times longer&lt;/a&gt;, an astonishing result in light of the poor efficacy of existing treatments for unresectable pancreatic cancer, a result that Gonzalez couldn't just wave away, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/nicholas_gonzalez_response_to_the_failed.php"&gt;although he did try&lt;/a&gt;. Other examples include &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/studying_homeopathy_in_third_world_countries.php"&gt;clinical trials of homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; for infectious diarrhea in Honduras and a &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;clinical trial of chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt;. I've also criticized the "autism biomed" movement, that amalgamation of parents who believe that vaccines cause autism and are willing to subject their children to all sorts of quackery to "cure" the "vaccine injury" of uncontrolled and unethical experimentation on autistic children, the worst examples of which are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/the_martyrdom_of_st_andy.php"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; and, even worse, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/antivaccination_warriors_vs_re.php"&gt;Mark and David Geier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These abuses of science and ethics notwithstanding, whenever a story describing a lapse in research ethics in clinical trials in SBM come around, you can count on the crazies to pounce all over it as "proof" that SBM is hopelessly corrupt and, by implication, that there must be something to their woo, be it anti-vaccine pseudoscience and quackery or quackery of any variety. That's why it didn't surprise me too much to see that neither the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism nor &lt;em&gt;über&lt;/em&gt;-quack Mike Adams wasted any time pouncing all over a news report about a horrifically unethical study that the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) carried out in Guatemala in the 1940s. At AoA, Media Editor Anne Dachel layed on the stupid with a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/10/valid-concern-for-60-year-old-medical-travesty-what-about-todays.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Valid Concern for 60 Year Old Medical Travesty: What About Today's?&lt;/a&gt; while over at NaturalNews.com Mike Adams ramped the crazy up to 11--does he even have a lower setting?--in writing &lt;a href="http://www.NaturalNews.com/029924_medical_experiments_Guatemala.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Guatemalan STD medical experiments were just one crime in a long history of medical-government collusion to use humans as guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, an advocate of pseudoscience and quackery starts out with a reasonable complaint, a terrible and disturbing story, even, and then completely misses the point. Instead of understanding that such incidents emphasize the need for guidelines to protect patients from unethical experiments, including those by their heroes, they use them as a weapon, as you will see. This particular incident was indeed a gross failure on the part of SBM to live up to ethical precepts, but, as shocking as this incident is, it does not validate Mike Adam's quackery and conspiracy theories or Anne Dachel's anti-vaccine pseudoscience any more than it invalidates science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/the_guatemala_syphilis_experiment_human.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/the_guatemala_syphilis_experiment_human.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/4TCL6j96rWs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286189821501"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29393">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6517930f67150114</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">How My 5K Run Went…</title><published>2010-10-04T10:00:16Z</published><updated>2010-10-04T10:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/04/how-my-5k-run-went/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I ran my first 5K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladyfriend&lt;/strong&gt;: Because they’re almost done with the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: [&lt;em&gt;Gasping&lt;/em&gt;] You. Go. I’m. Watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladyfriend&lt;/strong&gt;: Time to sprin–AHHHHHH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;She splats on the ground&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Uh. Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladyfriend&lt;/strong&gt;: My hands are bleeding &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: [&lt;em&gt;Gasping&lt;/em&gt;] At. Least. I. Will. Beat. You. [&lt;em&gt;Start to pick up speed&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladyfriend&lt;/strong&gt;: NEVER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;She runs ahead and beats me by a couple seconds&lt;/em&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how I remember it, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got checked out by a local medic… other than the gaping holes in her hands, I think she’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-411x550.jpg" alt="" title="photo" width="411" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yep, I’m the good guy, taking a picture while she’s in pain.  Got video, too!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final time was 41:02. This means a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– I’m on p. 66 of &lt;a href="http://www.ramracing.org/race-results/2010-bucktown-5k-overall/"&gt;the official results page&lt;/a&gt;. There are only 71 pages.  You can never hold this against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– All you people who run “marathons” are *%$&amp;amp;ing crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– I suppose there’s something to be said for training…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the ladyfriend if she wanted to add anything to this summary.  She suggested the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He survived.  But he got beat by a girl.  Who was injured.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for her parents, we all ended up driving to the 5K together, so I got to meet them after all.  Nice people &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I’m doing another 5K in two weeks. I swear it all sounded like a brilliant plan before I actually had to do it…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read about this, and heard &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html"&gt;Harris’s TED talk on the topic&lt;/a&gt;, I smelled trouble.  Wasn’t this just updated utilitarianism, with all its attendant problems?  And &lt;em&gt;whose&lt;/em&gt; well-being is to be maximized?  What if society’s well-being (the overall total) is maximized by treating some people abysmally? Is it moral to torture somebody if that would save hundreds of lives? Or would that ultimately &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; well-being by degrading social standards?  And what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; well-being, anyway? How do you trade off things like economic well-being versus physical well-being when these come into conflict?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I hadn’t read Sam’s book, I reserved judgment; but I predicted that philosphers would handle the book roughly as the incursion of an upstart into their territory.  Appiah gives it a mixed review, singling out some of the issues that concerned me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, what he [Harris] ends up endorsing is something very like utilitarianism, a philosophical position that is now more than two centuries old, and that faces a battery of familiar problems. Even if you accept the basic premise, how do you compare the well-being of different people? Should we aim to increase average well-being (which would mean that a world consisting of one bliss case is better than one with a billion just slightly less blissful people)? Or should we go for a cumulative total of well-being (which might favor a world with zillions of people whose lives are just barely worth living)? If the mental states of conscious beings are what matter, what’s wrong with killing someone in his sleep? How should we weigh present well-being against future well-being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that Harris is unaware of these questions, exactly. He refers to the work of Derek Parfit, who has done more than any philosopher alive to explore such difficulties. But having acknowledged some of these complications, he is inclined to push them aside and continue down his path . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris was a philosophy major at Stanford, but he is inclined to scant most of what philosophers have had to say about well-being. There is, for example, a movement in contemporary philosophy and economics known as “the capabilities approach,” which takes seriously the question of identifying the components of well-being and measuring them. But neither of the two leading exponents of this approach — the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen and the philosopher and classicist Martha Nussbaum — gets a mention in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Appiah lauds Harris’s exposition of the science (and criticizes his bashing of religion):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s plenty of interest in “The Moral Landscape.” Harris draws our attention to the fact that “science increasingly allows us to identify aspects of our minds that cause us to deviate from norms of factual and moral reasoning.” And when he stays closest to neuroscience, he says much that is interesting and important: about the limits of functional magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for studying brain function; about the current understanding of psychopaths (whose brains display “significantly less activity in regions of the brain that generally respond to emotional stimuli”); about the similarities in the ways in which moral and nonmoral belief seem to be handled in the brain. I found myself wishing for less of the polemic against religion, which recurs often and takes up one entire chapter — he has had two bites of that apple already, and will soon be reduced to gnawing at the core — and I wanted more of the illumination that comes from our increasing understanding of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appiah notes that “a real contribution to the old project of a ‘naturalized ethics’ would have required a fuller engagement with its contradictions and complications,” but there’s a problem with this criticism. Had Harris made his book a thorough exposition of his neo-utilitarianism, complete with references to all previous work and discussions of all possible problems, it would have become a scholarly tome rather than, as he intended, a “popular” discussion of science and morality. (As it is, it’s plenty scholarly with many pages of footnotes.)  Similarly, had Dawkins dealt with all “sophisiticated” theology in &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, many fewer people would have read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a short book—191 small pages of text and 43 pages of footnotes—and, judging from the introductory chapter, it’s well worth reading.  The mantra of “‘is’ doesn’t imply ‘ought’” has been accepted too uncritically, and it’s time for all of us to revisit the Naturalistic Fallacy. I’ll post my take in a few weeks, and maybe others can then chime in with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;:  Sam put &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/can-there-be-a-science-of_b_748627.html"&gt;an excerpt from his book&lt;/a&gt; (and a very short video) up at HuffPo.  And it would be good for people to read Sam’s book before they criticize his thesis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to only write for the blog for the foreseeable future on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays – simply because I’m out of time! Or at least, it feels as if there’s more pressing needs that I really should be devoting my energies to, and the blog is just going to have to be fifth or even sixth priority on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month is going to be dedicated to final edits, writing for other sites, writing, grading and tidying up for work and attending at least one convention (over the space of six months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently I’ve started revising over the podcast structure and interviews, with an aim to doing some more vodcast elements. There’s also a few episodes yet to be edited that come from Dragon*Con audio, so that’ll be happening over the next few weeks. There’s two great interviews about developments in the UK that will be out next; there’s some fantastic people that have been kind enough to tell me about events of the skeptic-kind, so keep an eye on the &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;Token Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; site for overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, feel free to suggest anything that you think I can write about / investigate; I think at this rate I’ll be looking over the parts of my literature review of the thesis and using elements for blog-posts, simply because I think it’ll be useful to revise over any recent developments in the research and add those to keep it as current as possible. Thanks for reading, thanks for supporting – download the podcast, feel free to comment and check in three times a week where I’ll try to be more detailed than I have for a while with this site, and hopefully you can enjoy the content still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other news about events, things I’ve contributed to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine"&gt;UK Skeptics magazine&lt;/a&gt; – will be getting a copy of that soon, which features an interview / book review. There’s also an interview by me done earlier this year, in a book I haven’t got yet – &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/bestof"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Statues &lt;em&gt;Weep&lt;/em&gt;: The Best of the &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I plan on tracking down that too. More articles for &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/archive/category/curiouser_and_curiouser"&gt;Curiouser and Curiouser&lt;/a&gt; should be out very soon too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book-launch for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/theaustralianbookofatheism"&gt;The Australian Book of Atheism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; should be a little later this year – and I’m in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an anthology of essays from around 35 Australian authors including Bioethicist, &lt;a href="http://www.cannold.com/"&gt;Leslie Cannold&lt;/a&gt;; Radio National’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Williams"&gt;Robyn Williams&lt;/a&gt; (the Science Show); Former nun, &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Author/Livermore,%20Colette"&gt;Colette Livermore&lt;/a&gt;; Former Hillsong member, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Levin"&gt;Tanya Levin&lt;/a&gt; and Entertainer, &lt;a href="http://www.timminchin.com/about/"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;Karen Stollznow&lt;/a&gt;, skeptic and presenter of the &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/"&gt;Point of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; radio show and podcast and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/TAMAustralia/"&gt;TAMOz&lt;/a&gt; is happening in November, and &lt;a href="http://www.qedcon.org/"&gt;QED in February&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an event in Melbourne that’s happening on the way home from TAMOz that I’ll be attending. In addition, there should be a booklaunch in Perth for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/book/theaustralianbookofatheism"&gt;The Australian Book of Atheism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and I’ll have more details on that as it comes to hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in terms of other local events – for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/PerthAtheists"&gt;Perth Atheists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; there’s a &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/PerthAtheists/calendar/14542849/"&gt;Variety Night on 30th October&lt;/a&gt;, being held at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/PerthAtheists/venue/904726/?eventId=14542849&amp;amp;popup=true"&gt;Cups Cafe&lt;/a&gt; in Subiaco – more details for local atheists who want to be part of the festivities are on the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/PerthAtheists/calendar/14542849/"&gt;Perth Atheists website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a Bookclub for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Skeptics"&gt;Perth Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that has started doing very well – &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Skeptics/messages/boards/thread/9829941/i/gh_new_discussion_tl"&gt;New Meetup: Skeptics Book Club Meetup – &lt;em&gt;50 Reasons People Give for Believing in God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That’s happening on Friday, October 15, 2010 6:30 PM and the location is yet to be given, but you can join the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Skeptics/"&gt;Perth Skeptics Meetup&lt;/a&gt; to learn more as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

	This phenomenon isn&amp;#39;t restricted to males either - female organgutans were observed exhibiting inspiring creativity by fashioning home-made dildos from lianas.  Female horses during breeding season will rub up against fence posts, barn doors and seemingly anything made of wood.

	 

	Discovering that a species can milk the moose is fun and entertaining and often awe-inspiring.  You have to respect a macaque for committing 1-6% of its daily metabolism to producing ejaculate and the ability for &amp;#39;self-directed oral sex&amp;#39; in a variety of mammals.  But the bigger question is why?  If masturbation is so widespread among all animals then it must provide an evolutionary advantage. 

	 

	

	A new study  has found ground squirrels can be added to thelist of those that shake hands with the devil.  Previous explanations to this blatant waste of sperm in and around a females oestrus period were that masturbation provided a way to display fertility to potential mates or as a deterrant to rivals.  In contrast, it was also thought that masturbation could provide a sexual release or as a way to refresh sperm.  Studies done on the ground squirrles of Namibia concluded that masturbation was likely as a method of cleansing the genitalia.   This is likely species dependent when genitalia are more accessible to the environment and likely to be dirtier.  In other words, they kept clean by getting down and dirty.

	 

	The more likely reason for whacking off is that sperm quality improves the more a man pleasures his loins - a recent study suggests that daily masturbation and ejaculation can reduce the amount of accumulated DNA damage in sperm by 12%.  Therefore wasting sperm into a sock can actually improve the mobility of sperm and increase fertility.  A continuation of this theory is the idea of sperm competition, this is when sperm from multiple males have a race to the egg and undergo various forms of chemical competition to see who gets to be the lucky shizz.  Most women likely don&amp;#39;t have sex with multiple males during their ovulatory phase... we aren&amp;#39;t like the chimpanzee - where a single female chimp was observed to have sex with 50 male partners in a single day.  (ouch). 

	 

	One consequence of shining the pole so often is that the testis enlarges to accomodate the demand for sperm.   It&amp;#39;s personal preference if this is desirable but there may be an evolutionary significance to larger balls.  And that is the biggest balls gets to worm.  There is precendent amonst several different species, including our ape cousins, that larger testes actually attract mates.  It is unlikely that larger ball size relates to the desirability of a human male as most men don&amp;#39;t go around showing off their packages. 

	 

	           

	 

	The idea that refreshing sperm seems to account for the evolution of masturbation from turtles to donkeys.  It is unclear if these species have hairy palms.

Male chimps respond by masturbating and attempting to mount them. A new study claims we humans have moved on from this, but not a lot. Daniela Kayser&amp;#39;s team found that when a lady wears red it prompts men to ask her more intimate questions and to sit closer to her. Surprisingly, this is the first time that the effect of colour on human sexual attraction behaviour has been studied. Past research has relied on asking participants to report their attraction rather than measuring their actual behaviour.

Twenty-three heterosexual or bisexual male undergrads were shown a photo of a blonde-haired, blue-eyed female rated in pilot work by men as moderately attractive. Half the participants saw a version in which she wore a red shirt, the other half saw an identical version bar for the fact that the shirt was green. Next the participants were asked to select 5 questions from a choice of 24 to ask the woman (these ranged from &amp;#39;Where are you from?&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;How could a guy get your attention at a bar?&amp;#39;). The key finding was that men who&amp;#39;d viewed the woman wearing red opted to ask more intimate questions.

In a second study another 22 male undergrads were shown a photo of a moderately attractive brown-haired, brown-eyed woman wearing either a red shirt or a blue shirt. The men were tricked into thinking they were about to have a conversation with the woman in an adjacent room. They were shown to the room, which contained two chairs - one at a table and one at the side. The men were told the woman would sit at the chair by the table and instructed to grab the other chair so as to sit across from her. The men who&amp;#39;d seen the photo in which the woman wore red placed their chair nearer to where they thought she was about to sit. This difference wasn&amp;#39;t caused by effects on mood.

Kayser and her colleagues said their findings are consistent with evolutionary accounts of human attraction and have obvious practical implications. &amp;#39;It appears that women would do well to wear a red shirt or dress when preparing for a date with a desirable man, and women may be particularly successful in online dating when they post a picture of themselves in red apparel. More generally, our findings should be of considerable interest to fashion consultants and product designers, as well as marketers and advertisers.&amp;#39; 

Were these recommendations to be heeded widely, it raises the comical prospect of city bars and night-clubs being filled entirely with red-clad women and men, like rival sports teams arriving for a match only to discover they&amp;#39;re both wearing the same strip. Yes, the men in red too, because another recent study by the same research team found that men wearing red were rated as more attractive and high-status by women.

Examples include the misbegotten &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6826"&gt;clinical trial for the Gonzalez protocol for pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;, which — surprise, surprise! — ended up showing that patients undergoing Dr. Gonzalez’s combination of 150 supplements a day, dietary manipulations, and coffee enemas, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1430"&gt;actually did much worse&lt;/a&gt; than those undergoing standard of care, despite how depressingly poor the results of standard of care are; clinical trials of homeopathy in Honduras and other Third World countries, which both &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=460"&gt;Wally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=472"&gt;Sampson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=82"&gt;I lambasted&lt;/a&gt;; and ongoing &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;clinical trial of chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; for cardiovascular disease. I’ve also criticized the “autism biomed” movement, that amalgamation of parents who believe that vaccines cause autism and yet are willing to subject their children to all sorts of quackery to “cure” the “vaccine injury” of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2815"&gt;uncontrolled and unethical experimentation on autistic children&lt;/a&gt;. As valid as all these criticisms are, it is important to recognize that science-based medicine is not free of its own abuse of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the concept of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6857"&gt;clinical equipoise&lt;/a&gt;. Clinical equipoise is a critical concept in any clinical trial. Basically, a state of clinical equipoise exists when there is genuine scientific uncertainty over which of the options being tested in/on living, breathing human beings is better, and any clinical trial in which a state of clinical equipoise does not exist is at the very least ethically dodgy and probably downright unethical. For example, when the occasional anti-vaccine activist argues for a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing vaccinated children and unvaccinated children, it’s easy to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=939"&gt;shoot that idea down as unethical&lt;/a&gt; because there is no clinical equipoise. The children receiving placebo vaccines would be put at a much higher risk of suffering harm compared to the vaccinated children because they would be left unprotected against life-threatening diseases. In the realm of conventional medicine, the reason that few cancer clinical trials involve a placebo control group anymore but instead test a new therapy either against the standard of care or with the standard of care is because in many, if not nearly all, cases placebo use in a cancer patient is unethical when there exists effective therapy, even if the therapy is not all that effective. What all this boils down to is that science is only part of the basis of science-based medicine. Medical ethics must take precedence. After all, arguably the most efficacious way to test a new antibiotic would be to infect people with the bacteria the antibiotic treats and then divide these people up into a placebo control group and a group receiving the antibiotics to see how each group does. After all, this is the sort of thing that the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/doctors_of_depravity.php"&gt;Nazis and Japanese did during World War II&lt;/a&gt;, and the same sort of dehumanization and abuse of research subjects that every ethical precept regarding human subjects research that has been developed since then, such as the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, has been designed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, medical scientists in the U.S. have not always lived up to these precepts. The most famous example is arguably the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis experiment&lt;/a&gt;, in which poor black men with syphilis were studied and the control group denied effective therapy for syphilis even after it was known that penicillin was an effective treatment for syphilis. This study spanned 40 years, from 1932 to 1972, and is justifiably held up as one of the worst examples of research misconduct in American history, if not the history of the world. The shock the revelation of this study to the American public in 1972, when it learned of men dying of syphilis, women contracting syphilis, and babies being born with congenital syphilis, all unnecessarily, led to Belmont Report and the establishment of the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that there was an even worse atrocity against medical science perpetrated by U.S. investigators in Guatemala over 60 years ago that only now has come to light in stories in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/health/research/02infect.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39456324/ns/health-sexual_health"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/02/3027753.htm"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. So bad was the offense that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius have &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/10/20101001a.html"&gt;issued a formal apology&lt;/a&gt; to the Guatemalan government for the experiments in which Guatemalan prisoners were intentionally infected with syphilis and then treated with antibiotics, an apology that President Obama &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/10/01/read-out-presidents-call-with-guatemalan-president-colom"&gt;reiterated in a personal telephone call&lt;/a&gt; to Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experimenting on Guatemalans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guatemala syphilis experiment might have remained lost in the depths of history, unknown, records of its having taken place buried in archives at the University of Pittsburgh, were it not for the efforts of Wellesley College Professor of Women’s Studies &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Profile/mr/sreverby.html"&gt;Susan Reverby&lt;/a&gt; and medical historian, who unearthed the notes of John C. Cutler, who, ironically enough, later spent some time as an important member of the team carrying out the Tuskegee experiment and continued to defend the study 20 years after it was closed. What she found was horrifying, and she has recently &lt;a href="http://web.wellesley.edu/web/detailview.psml?rcFilePath=/content/departments/publicaffairs/news/100110susanreverby.xml"&gt;published a manuscript&lt;/a&gt; describing her findings. Because I always like to go to the primary source wherever possible, I will refer you to the manuscript, available on &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/fac_reverby.html"&gt;Dr. Reverby’s faculty web page&lt;/a&gt; and entitled &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/Reverby%20Normal%20Exposure.pdf"&gt;“Normal Exposure” and Inoculation Syphilis: A PHS “Tuskegee” Doctor in Guatemala, 1946-48&lt;/a&gt; (synopsis &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/Synopsis%20Reverby%20&amp;#39;Normal%20Exposure&amp;#39;.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The HHS response can be found &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/1946inoculationstudy/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/10/20101001a.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued on Friday by Clinton and Sebelius in both English and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background behind Professor Reverby’s revelations is important. As she states in the &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/Synopsis%20Reverby%20&amp;#39;Normal%20Exposure&amp;#39;.pdf"&gt;advanced synopsis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most infamous of American research studies is the “Tuskegee” Syphilis Study in which the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) watched, but did not treat, hundreds of African American men with late stage syphilis for forty years (1932-1972).1 Much of the folklore surrounding this study assumes that the doctors actually infected African American men in Macon County, Alabama with syphilis by inoculating them with the disease. Historians of the Study, the author included, have spent years now explaining why this was not true and why this myth persists. Part of the explanation is that the spirochete-shaped bacteria that cause syphilis cannot be cultured and grown in a laboratory, easily put into a syringe, or transferred from the blood of one infected person to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inoculation story that is part of the Tuskegee myths did, however, go on elsewhere. In 1946-48, Dr. John C. Cutler, a PHS physician who would later be part of the Syphilis Study in Alabama in the 1960s and continue to defend it two decades after it ended in the 1990s, was running a syphilis inoculation project in Guatemala, co-sponsored by the PHS, the National Institutes of Health, the Pan American Health Sanitary Bureau (now the Pan American Health Organization), and the Guatemalan government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the early days of penicillin and the PHS was deeply interested in whether penicillin could be used to prevent, not just cure, early syphilis infection, whether better blood tests for the disease could be established, what dosages of penicillin actually cured infection, and to understand the process of re-infection after cures. Many scientific questions remained to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you see why the Guatemala syphilis experiment is arguably worse than the Tuskegee experiment, although the Guatemalan experiment only lasted two years and every man infected with syphilis was given penicillin. On the other hand, as the &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WomenSt/Reverby%20Normal%20Exposure.pdf"&gt;full manuscript&lt;/a&gt; describes, although researchers did obtain permission for their studies from the prisons and other institutions with which they worked, they did not receive permission from the inmates or their families. Indeed, deception was part and parcel of the entire process. In return for cooperation, researchers offered supplies to the institution, such as anti-seizure medications like Dilantin, refrigerators to store medications, and a “motion picture projector that supplied the sole recreation for the inmates, metal cups, plates and forks to supplement the completely inadequate supply available.” Individual subjects were plied with cigarettes, “an entire packet for inoculation, blood draws or spinal taps and a single cigarette for ‘clinical observation.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also went to ludicrous extremes to infect the men with syphilis. First, they took advantage of legalized prostitution in Guatemala and the fact that Guatemala allowed prostitutes to pay regular visits to men in penal institutions by locating prostitutes with syphilis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the cooperation of officials at the Ministry of Justice and the warden of Guatemala City’s Central Penitentiary, which housed nearly 1500 inmates, prostitutes who tested positive for either syphilis or gonorrhea were allowed to offer their services to prison inmates, paid for by U.S. taxpayers through the funds of the PHS. In yet another set of experiments, uninfected prostitutes had inoculum of the diseases placed on their cervixes before the sexual visits began. Serological tests were done on the inmates before the prostitutes were invited to the prison and then afterwards to see if infection had occurred. The men were divided into groups and various chemical and biological prophylaxis techniques were tested after presumed infection. If positive, the men were then provided with enough penicillin to produce a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your tax dollars at work in 1946. This method soon ran into problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not enough of the sexually well-serviced men (the researchers actually timed how long they spent with the prostitutes and thought they acted “like rabbits”), even when plied with alcohol, seemed to getting syphilis. The prostitutes were not easily controlled either, and one researcher lamented, “unfortunately our female donor is leaving her profession for marriage and is no longer available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the unreliability of the serological tests used to diagnose syphilis in the 1940s, the researchers soon went beyond these methods. It turned out that there were too many positive blood tests even before the men were exposed to syphilis, which posed a huge problem given that the research protocol required men who had never had syphilis or who’d had it and been cured. This led to a trial examining the serum of children in an orphanage, where they found that indeed the false positive rate of the serological test for syphilis was quite high. This problem also meant that the researchers couldn’t yet answer whether penicillin could prevent syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Cutler and his team went beyond using prostitutes and isolated syphilis to directly inoculate inmates with. Their sources were the gumma (syphilitic growths) on the testicles of infected rabbits or scraping the penile chancres of infected men, from which they had to isolate the spirochete that causes syphilis. This was difficult, because the spirochete could not survive more than 45 to 90 minutes outside the body, during which time it had to be isolated, centrifuged with fresh home-made beef heart broth, and then delivered to the subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the men, the inoculation was often much more direct after what soldiers for generations had called the “short arm” inspection. They chose men with “at least moderately long foreskins [to keep the mucus membranes moist]” and who could “sit or stand calmly in one spot for several hours.” In the experiments, a doctor held the subject’s penis, pulled back the foreskin, abraded the penis slightly just short of drawing blood by scraping the skin with a hypodermic needle, introduced a cotton pledget (or small dressing) and dripped drops of the syphilitic emulsion onto the pad and through it to the roughed skin on the man’s penis for at least an hour, sometimes two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also compared with other methods of introducing the spirochete, including scraping of the forearm, ingestion of syphilitic tissue mixed with distilled water, introduction into the spinal fluid, and direct injection into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that even back in 1946 many of the officials who knew of or participated in the experiment knew it was unethical. Even Cutler was reported to have said, “As you can imagine, we are holding our breath, and we are explaining to the patients and others concerned with but a few key exceptions, that the treatment is a new one utilizing serum followed by penicillin. This double talk keeps me hopping at times.” Even more disturbing is the general attitude among several researchers seemed to view law breaking as sometimes necessary for the advancement of medical science, as Thomas Rivers, who led the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research Hospital in New York, made clear in his memoir in 1967:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, all I can say is, it’s against the law to do many things, but the law winks when a reputable man wants to do a scientific experiment. For example, the criminal code of the City of New York holds that is a felony to inject a person with infectious material. Well, I tested out live yellow fever vaccine right on my ward in the Rockefeller Hospital. It was no secret, and I assure you that the people in the New York City Department of Health knew it was being done….Unless the law winks occasionally, you have no progress in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against this attitude that ethical standards and laws have evolved. It is also as a result of these abuses that many minorities and underprivileged groups of people are mistrustful of physicians and science. Supporters of SBM can’t deny that there have been serious ethical violations committed by overzealous scientists who came to value the study of their scientific question more than they did for the rights and dignity of their human subjects, because the evidence of such violations of human rights are incontrovertible. The questions remain: What to do about them and how to prevent them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Belmont Report, The Common Rule, and CAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the horrors of Nazi medical experimentation and the abuses during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt; (remember, the Guatemala syphilis experiment was not widely known until now), it was clear that rules were needed to protect human research subjects from such abuses. First came the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code"&gt;Nuremberg Code&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. This code, drafted in the wake of the infamous Doctors’ Trial at Nuremberg set forth ten principles to govern human subjects experimentation, many of which regular readers of SBM will be familiar with. Examples include the requirement for informed consent; that unnecessary pain and suffering be avoided; that the experiment should be designed based on the results of animal experimentation and knowledge of the natural history of the disease that justifies the performance of the experiment (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6826"&gt;prior plausibility&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?); the requirement that subjects can refuse to continue at any time; and that no experiment should be conducted where injury, disability, or death can reasonably be expected (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6857"&gt;clinical equipoise&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/helsinki/"&gt;The Declaration of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in 1964 by the World Medical Assembly, is based on the same principles as the Nuremberg Code but takes them even further, for example, stating that “the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject.” The Helsinki Declaration was last updated in 2008. It is ironic that at the time the Nuremberg Code was being written and approved that the U.S. government was engaging in the same sort of abuse of human research subjects that the Nuremberg Code was designed to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Nuremberg Code and the Helsinki Declaration notwithstanding, the Tuskegee debacle was the impetus that led to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report"&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm"&gt;Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research&lt;/a&gt; finalized on April 18, 1979. This report identifies three essential and fundamental ethical principles for human subject research (respect for persons, beneficence, and justice) that form the basis of all Department of Health and Human Services human subject protection regulations to this day. It is essential reading for anyone doing human subject research in this country. In 1991, these regulations were — finally! — codified into what is now known as &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm"&gt;The Common Rule&lt;/a&gt;. All institutions doing federally funded research are required to adhere to The Common Rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of The Common Rule is the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is in essence a committee that oversees all human subject research for an institution and makes sure that the studies are ethical in design and that they conform to all federal regulations.  Basically, IRBs are charged with weighing the risks and benefits of proposed human subject research and making sure that (1) the risks are minimized and that the risk:benefit ratio is very favorable; (2) to minimize any pain or suffering that might come about because of the experimental therapy; and (3) to make sure that researchers obtain truly &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.116"&gt;informed consent&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve written extensively about The Common Rule before in the context of how certain CAM trials violate the Common Rule and how, for example, Mark and David Geier &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=503"&gt;created a sham IRB packed with their cronies&lt;/a&gt; (as so ably &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/98"&gt;documented by Kathleen Seidel&lt;/a&gt;) to rubber-stamp their unethical studies of using Lupron to treat the “vaccine injury” they believe to be the cause of autism. What is important (and embarrassing for proponents of SBM) to note is that The Common Rule only first went into effect in 1981 and reached its current form in the 1991 revision to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title 45 CFR 46 (Public Welfare) Subparts A, B, C and D. Subpart A. What that means is that, in the United States at least, the current government regulations mandating a baseline standard of ethics have only been in effect less than 30 years and only in their current form for less than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ethics: The difference between CAM and SBM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, CAM proponents have jumped all over these revelations. For example, even quackery promoter Mike Adams has a grain of a valid point when he writes hysterical headlines like &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029924_medical_experiments_Guatemala.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Guatemalan STD medical experiments were just one crime in a long history of medical-government collusion to use humans as guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for him, he can’t resist taking a valid criticism and running right off the rails with it. Most of the examples he mentions date back at least 50 years and are now commonly known. Few of them are more recent than the 1970s. Most of these are either problems that couldn’t reasonably been foreseen (for instance, the observation that 30% of the participants of a trial for a vaccine against hepatitis B were found to be HIV-positive in 1983) or that are questionable pseudoscience at best, such as ranting against the clinical trials of Gardasil or labeling vaccine mandates as being the equivalent to the Tuskegee or Guatemala syphilis experiments. This is a point that Anne Dachel, Media Editor for the anti-vaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism, predictably parroted yesterday in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/10/valid-concern-for-60-year-old-medical-travesty-what-about-todays.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Valid Concern for 60 Year Old Medical Travesty: What About Today’s?&lt;/a&gt;, in which she attacks bioethicist Art Caplan for alleged hypocrisy in his refutations of anti-vaccine misinformation in “contrast” to his &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39463624/ns/health-health_care/"&gt;justifiable outrage&lt;/a&gt; over the revelation of the Guatemala syphilis experiment, even going so far as to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing exposure to mercury is having a dramatic impact on our lives.  “Nonetheless, officials knew it was wrong” also means that there’s a great incentive to cover up the damage at all costs.  There is a real lesson from the Guatemala and Tuskegee experiments.  Let’s hope it doesn’t take 60 years before officials admit what mercury exposure in vaccine has done to our children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that the concept that mercury in vaccines causes autism is a long-discredited hypothesis, a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;failed hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; even more discredited (if that were possible) than the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism. The difference is important; in the case of vaccines science is on the side of those defending the clinical trials studying vaccines and their efficacy, not on the side of anti-vaccine activists like Anne Dachel. Odd, too, that she failed to mention &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=503"&gt;Mark and David Geier’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3941"&gt;Andrew Wakefield’s&lt;/a&gt; completely unethical experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, charges of hypocrisy go both ways, which is why one of the reasons I wanted to write about the Guatemala syphilis experiment is that it is a stark reminder to proponents of SBM (like myself) that SBM does have a history of not always being as ethically pure as we should be. Indeed, the U.S. Government was right, albeit late, to &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/10/20101001a.html"&gt;apologize to the Guatemalan government&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sexually transmitted disease inoculation study conducted from 1946-1948 in Guatemala was clearly unethical. Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health.  We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices.  The conduct exhibited during the study does not represent the values of the United States, or our commitment to human dignity and great respect for the people of Guatemala.  The study is a sad reminder that adequate human subject safeguards did not exist a half-century ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the regulations that govern U.S.-funded human medical research prohibit these kinds of appalling violations. The United States is unwavering in our commitment to ensure that all human medical studies conducted today meet exacting U.S. and international legal and ethical standards.  In the spirit of this commitment to ethical research, we are launching a thorough investigation into the specifics of this case from 1946.  In addition, through the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, we are also convening a body of international experts to review and report on the most effective methods to ensure that all human medical research conducted around the globe today meets rigorous ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reparations to survivors and families would be entirely appropriate in a case like this, as is the investigation ordered by the U.S. government into what happened. It is also entirely appropriate to point out, as &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/infectious-disease-in-national/guatemalan-syphilis-experiment-the-name-of-public-health"&gt;Robert Herriman&lt;/a&gt; does, that at the time Dr. Cutler’s experiments were being carried out, the U.S. government was passing judgment on the Nazi doctors who carried out the same sorts of experiments, such as &lt;a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-legacy-of-nazi-medicine"&gt;purposely infecting prisoners with tetanus&lt;/a&gt; and other agents to test the effectiveness of the antibiotic, sulfonamide? What was done in Guatemala in the name of public health was, at its core, different only in that the U.S. didn’t actually round up prisoners and throw them in concentration camps to do its experiments. In other words, little different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference, however, is that proponents of SBM must be (and, for the most part, are) advocates for ethics in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; medical experimentation, be it animal or human research. SBM depends upon science and rigorous clinical trials, but never at the expense of violating clinical equipoise, subjecting subjects to risks without true informed consent, or violating patient autonomy. All too many CAM advocates and anti-vaccine advocates use ethical misadventures and abuses as nothing more than a &lt;a href="http://www.fallacyfiles.org/tuquoque.html"&gt;tu quoque&lt;/a&gt; argument; they delight in pointing out the gross ethical violations that are committed from time to time by science-based investigators while ignoring those committed by “their side,” such as Nicholas Gonzalez and the investigators performing the Gonzalez trial, Mark and David Geier, Andrew Wakefield, and the investigators performing the TACT trial. (Ironically, except for the Geiers’ trial, all of these trials were funded by our tax dollars — every bit as much as the Guatemalan or Tuskegee syphilis trials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long argued that there should be no such thing as “alternative” medicine. Rather, there should be one scientific standard for medicine regardless of where it comes from, and that includes all of what is commonly referred to as “CAM.” Similarly, there should be one ethical standard for all research involving human subjects. Unlike Adams and Dachel, when I condemn ethical atrocities in CAM trials that does not mean I will turn a blind eye when such lapses occur in trials of ostensibly science-based medicine and nor should anyone else. The Guatemalan syphilis experiment was indeed a gross failure on the part of SBM to live up to ethical precepts and police its own, but, as shocking as this incident is, it does not validate Mike Adam’s quackery and conspiracy theories or Anne Dachel’s anti-vaccine pseudoscience any more than it invalidates science-based medicine. What it should do is to strengthen the resolve of anyone involved in SBM never to let something like this happen again, regardless of the kind of medical study.&lt;/p&gt;

And even those courts operate under a lower standard of evidence for scientific claims than in the court of science itself. Furthermore, the omnibus lawyers were denied in the appeals process. So it seems that the autism omnibus plaintiffs don’t have anywhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has become a truism: You know what "alternative medicine" that has real, positive effects is called?  &lt;strong&gt;Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newish UK-based website, created and maintained by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Blue_Wode/"&gt;Blue Wode&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This web site has been created as a voice of reason in response to the substantial amount of uncritical media coverage currently being given to alternative medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the fact that a large number of alternative health therapies lack any scientific validity, the perceived benefits of such therapies continue to be promoted. In reality, claims of therapeutic success can usually be attributed to an ailment being self-limiting (i.e. it will resolve itself in time without any treatment), or to an unpredictable placebo response brought about by the patient's deep belief in the therapy and/or the practitioner's sympathetic attention. In both these cases the practitioner will normally take the credit for having elicited a cure and the patient will become a believer in the therapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although most alternative health therapies are seen as being relatively safe, this is not always the case. It is known that some can be potentially harmful. Also, unlike fully qualified medical doctors, many alternative health practitioners have not received adequate training in the skills of differential diagnosis (i.e. the determination of which two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which a patient is suffering based on an analysis of the clinical data).  Consequently, this can place patients at risk of not receiving proper medical attention. Other factors such as patient dependency, misleading information, and patient exploitation due to an undefined and/or unlimited scope of practice can also cause a delay in appropriate medical advice or treatment being sought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these concerns in mind, it is the aim of this web site to alert consumers to questionable alternative health practices whilst encouraging them to always seek evidence-based medicine (EBM) first.&lt;/p&gt;

The satellite was the first human made machine to orbit the planet, and it was launched by the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.  In some ways, Sputnik's tiny "beep beep beep" sound heard radiometrically (but mostly metaphorically) in the west, from a  Soviet-launched device flying over whatever countries the Soviets decided to launch it over ... was the most frightening sound ever heard in the Situation Room (or the 1957 equivalent thereof) at the White House.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a direct relationship between Sputnik's launch and the subsequent building of hundreds of college campus buildings, expansions of science departments, expansion of science education, and funding for science research in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that today this intentional, self-reflexive effort to dominate the world via knowledge (albeit knowledge of weapons and rockets) has been converted today into the exact opposite; The fear mongering right wing militants have decided that it is better to NOT have excellent science research and science education.  Why? Because it hurts their cause.  Having a population schooled in rational thinking and the scientific method, and related thinking methodologies, is antithetical to the right wing's policy agenda.  For the most part, policy-making based on rational thinking about good data will lead to different approaches than policy-making based on business oriented special interests.  It is very much in the interest of the right wing to keep science educators busy defending public education from creationism than it is to have a well informed, rational, skeptical population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We truly have drifted close to rocky shores.  I don't think it is possible to stop the stupidity.  We ignored it for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I should clarify my obscure reference:  The Mouse that Roared was a movie.  At the least, check out the description of it, but better yet, get some popcorn and watch it some time.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/happy_anniversary_little_the_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/68_VnB1DjSg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286169657834"><id gr:original-id="http://scientopia.org/blogs/scicurious/2010/10/04/womens-brains-on-steroids-wut/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d194b33d8d846b48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Women’s Brains on Steroids?!

Letierce, Passant, Breslin and Decker (2010)  analysed Twitter feeds from the International Semantic Web Conference (#iswc2009), the Online Information Conference 2009 (#online09) and the European Semantic Technology Conference (#estc2009). First, they checked the distribution of tweets per user, then the distribution of tweets that were directed to individuals (@user messages). They found that both were Power Law distributions.After that, they used the HITS  (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm to determine the hubs and authorities of the conference feeds. Users who addressed many @user messages were considered hubs, while the users who received many @user tweets were  considered authorities. Letierce et al.&amp;#39;s not-very-surprising conclusion was  that users with both high hub and authorities scores were often the organizers of the events studied in the research. Also, users with real-world authority (their example was @timberners_lee) also had t-authority. Of course, Letierce and her colleagues couldn&amp;#39;t determine if there are more real-world authorities that don&amp;#39;t use Twitter (perhaps a content analysis of the tweets can determine if there are talks about people who aren&amp;#39;t Twitter users, but that&amp;#39;s very time-consuming and not the point of the research here). The paper includes a small survey (61 participants) done by the authors, but I chose not to discuss it here, because of the small sample. Letierce, J., Passant, A., Breslin, J., &amp;amp; Decker, S.

They set up their Young Earth Creationism display and attempt to convert the heathens with claims of medieval knights defeating tyrannosaurus and Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a triceratops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read my  &lt;a href="http://sevans.venomouspenguin.com/creo/" rel="external "&gt;previous post on another server&lt;/a&gt; for details of my earlier encounters, but here I’ll just say that between the two of them they know and understand about as much actual science as you’d expect from two people who never read more than can be found on typical creationist web sites. I stop by their display on the weekends I make it down to the farmers market and often watch and participate in the exchanges they have with people from various backgrounds. I’ve never seen anyone give their material even the slightest serious consideration, have heard a lot of people offer blunt and unflattering
appraisals of their display, and watched many a college student score big points against their creationist nonsense. But if they receive top marks for anything, it would be for persisting when there is absolutely no logical or practical reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Saturday Larry asserted that an article in Nature proves human and chimp DNA is only 70% similar, new research that disproves earlier claims in the high nineties. Kevin began scrambling through their folder of &lt;em&gt;creocrap&lt;/em&gt; and produced the relevant documentation. Was it the actual Nature paper? If you guessed yes, slap yourself across the face and go to bed without dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin handed me an article from the &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/5290/" rel="external "&gt;April 2010, Acts &amp;amp; Facts&lt;/a&gt;, published by the Institute for Creation Research titled “New Chromosome Research Undermines Human-Chimp Similarity Claims.” Without discussing it I told Larry I’d look up the actual paper and bring it to him next Saturday so we could compare the two. The weather was clear and cool, and I was already on the &lt;a href="http://mytzr.com" rel="external "&gt;TZR&lt;/a&gt; so I was going to spend the rest of the morning carving up some back roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home I read through the A&amp;amp;F piece and instantly realized something rather glaring. It doesn’t discuss any kind of comparison of human and chimp genome of any sizable portion, but rather as the title says the Y chromosomes of each. And further still, though ICR doesn’t say so, the Nature article makes it clear that the region of the chromosomes that were compared were only 25.8 megabases (Mb). In other words, the study dealt with less than 1% of the actual chimp genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did Larry claim that this paper shows that humans and chimps are only 70% similar? As I’ve found to be his modus operandi, Larry scans these little screeds for near-comprehensible tidbits and clings to them like Homer Simpson to the last pork chop. I found highlighted on the second page “[t]he researchers did postulate an overall 70 percent similarity…” and “only 70% of the chimp sequence could be aligned with the human sequence.” Remember, we’re talking about 25.8Mb on the Y chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at the actual paper, which of course is only a Google away. &lt;a href="http://eebweb.arizona.edu/nachman/Suggested%20Papers/Hughes_et_al_2010.pdf" rel="external "&gt;“Chimpanzee and Human Y chromosomes are remarkably divergent in structure and gene content”&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Letters section of Nature 463, 536-539 (28 January 2010). The meat of the research involved finishing “sequencing of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and completion previously reached for the human MSY.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers posit that since “primate sex chromosomes are hundreds of millions of years old, theories of decelerating decay would predict that the chimpanzee and human MSYs should have changed little since the separation of these two lineages just 6 million years ago.” And their research confirmed their hypothesis. “As expected, we found that the degree of similarity between orthologous chimpanzee and human MSY sequences (98.3% nucleotide identity) differs only modestly from that reported when comparing the rest of the chimpanzee and human genomes (98.8%).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also discovered something surprising: more than “30% of chimpanzee MSY sequence has no homologous, alignable counterpart in the human MSY, and vice versa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly big news and certainly worthy of investigation, but remember we’re talking about less than 1% of the total genome. It’s obviously incorrect to extrapolate this small sample across the entire genome of both species, and in fact the paper states that “[i]n this respect, the MSY differs radically from the remainder of the genome, where [less than] 2% of chimpanzee euchromatic sequence lacks a homologous, alignable counterpart in humans, and vice versa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the ICR completely ignores this last statement that reiterates the prevailing view and instead uses the 30% difference in less than 1% of the genome to claim the new findings “contradict long-held claims of human-chimp DNA similarity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distorting real scientific research to further their agenda is obviously nothing new for the ICR, and creationists in general, but participating in this exchange and experiencing firsthand how people like Larry and Kevin are manipulated by the professional anti-evolution organizations was enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose the word “manipulated” carefully, because I believe what is going on here is the ICR is exploiting the existential vulnerabilities in the theology of people like Kevin and Larry that the ICR actively shapes. And sells. Remember, the ICR makes their living, a very good one at that, convincing malleable fundamentalist Christians that their very soul, their place in either heaven or hell, depend on buying their books, toeing their party line, and coming to downtown Madison to regurgitate their nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes me wonder why Larry adamantly refuses to look up primary references, and why he so forcefully argues these positions as if he really understands the science, and indeed almost physically dismisses those who disagree with him. I can only conclude that he’s become so convinced his actual Christian salvation is bound to believing this dreck he can’t bring himself to read the actual research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to like Todd Wood, an actual honest creationist. Here’s &lt;a href="http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2010/01/chimp-and-human-y-chromosomes-radically.html" rel="external "&gt;his take on the Y chromosome research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the case of the MSY, it’s important to keep in mind that the chimp MSY sequence reported by Hughes et al. is only 25.8 Mb. That’s slightly less than 1% of the entire genome. Given that fixed nucleotide differences between the human and chimp genomes are around 1%, having yet another 1% difference in the very different Y chromosomes doesn’t make the genomes that much more different than they already were.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of further reading on the topic, start with &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/chimpanzees/genetics/chimpanzee-y-chromosome-2010.html" rel="external "&gt;John Hawks&lt;/a&gt; from UW Madison. I can brag here and say, “Yeah, I know John.” He’s come to speak at our &lt;a href="http://madsciencepub.org" rel="external "&gt;Science Pub&lt;/a&gt; events downtown Madison. Interestingly. I invited Larry to come to one of John’s talks to ask him in person about human evolution. &lt;a href="http://sevans.venomouspenguin.com/pics/cthoman100600286.jpg" rel="external "&gt;Larry&lt;/a&gt; said he would on several occasions but was absent the day of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s that I hear? Is that the sound of a chicken squawking?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 4:45 they call me and say, well, I really am the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; choice, and the guy they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want is a psychologist from Harvard named P.Z. Myers, but they haven’t yet heard back from him. I said, “Wait—P. Z. Myers is at Minnesota, not Harvard, and he’s not a psychologist but a biologist.”  The producer responds, “Oh well, let us call you back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5 p.m they call back and tell me that the guy they wanted wasn’t Myers but Steve Pinker, and they were highly embarrassed because they learned from him that he was about to meet me for a drink.  True enough, for my appointment was with Pinker. Anyway, they hooked the Pinkster, and I was off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No biggie, I thought—this stuff happens all the time, and it’s no shame to play second fiddle to Pinker.  Steve and I had a pleasant chat over beers and gin and tonics in the Harvard Faculty club, and laughed about the Olbermann coincidence. He also told me about his new big book, but more on that when it’s announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we departed for Harvard Square together, the heavens opened up with a huge deluge.  Since Steve was wearing his suit and tie for the t.v. show, I gave him my umbrella. He arrived at the subway fairly dry, but I got completely drenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Steve did a terrific job on Olbermann, and you should watch &lt;a href="http://www.clicker.com/tv/countdown-with-keith-olbermann/Creationism-a-political-platform-1116414/"&gt;his 4-minute explanation of why it’s important for American kids to learn evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do notice his trademark hair!  Steve wrote me today—and I don’t think it’s amiss to quote him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thanks for the altruistic loan of the umbrella! All for a good cause—not having a bad hair day on national t.v.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a new effort, &lt;a href="http://endthebullying.wordpress.com/"&gt;End the Bullying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End the Bullying uses this blog, a Facebook page, and Twitter to build a grassroots base of a grassroots base of people who are willing to provide support and insight for children who experience bullying and for their parents. Our hope is to provide resources via the Internet and, when needed, locally, for children and families who are experiencing bullying, especially when the authorities are not handling the situation as they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In news stories about bullying, especially when it has led to suicide, parents note that they repeatedly tried to contact school administrators or other authorities, only to be ignored. Many families whose stories do not make the news also attest to this cycle of nonresponsiveness. End the Bullying focuses on identifying people across the United States who can serve as contacts and facilitators for parents and children whose complaints are not being heard.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a really long read, but it’s also really worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry, Graham, and Lieberman were not alone in their belief that transforming the economy required coöperation, rather than confrontation, with industry. American Presidents who have attempted large-scale economic transformation have always had their efforts tempered—and sometimes neutered—by powerful economic interests. Obama knew that, too, and his Administration had led the effort to find workable compromises in the case of the bank bailouts, health-care legislation, and Wall Street reform. But on climate change Obama grew timid and gave up, leaving the dysfunctional Senate to figure out the issue on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Senate debate expired this summer, a longtime environmental lobbyist told me that he believed the “real tragedy” surrounding the issue was that Obama understood it profoundly. “I believe Barack Obama understands that fifty years from now no one’s going to know about health care,” the lobbyist said. “Economic historians will know that we had a recession at this time. Everybody is going to be thinking about whether Barack Obama was the James Buchanan of climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch. Harsh. I’m not sure I think it’s fair, but, you have to read the piece to make up your mind. You can read the full article, by Ryan Lizza, &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/11/101011fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all#ixzz11LCdWJvr"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So this was a topic I received via twitter, or perhaps I was being alerted to a finding via twitter... in any event I&amp;#39;ve decided to run with it.

The tweet was referencing the degree of eye-contact men make with women who have different coloured hair. Though I couldn&amp;#39;t find an article; (read more)

Speaking of puff pieces and charter schools reminded me that one of our faithful readers directed me to this &lt;a href="http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20100923/CONNECTIONS02/9230378/Liberty+Common+High+School+Adopts++Capstone++Virtues" rel="external "&gt;very amateurish article&lt;/a&gt; in the Fort Collins Coloradoan.  The article reads like advertising copy for the Liberty Common School, a charter school in Fort Collins, Colorado. As nearly as I can tell, most charter schools are in effect private schools operated with public funds; the Liberty Common School is a private &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; school operated with public funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to discuss charter schools in general, but I will discuss Liberty Common’s &lt;a href="http://www.libertycommon.org/academics/subject_areas/documents/SciencePolicy.pdf" rel="external "&gt;science policy&lt;/a&gt;, which reads like a Compendium of Creationist Canards. Under the heading, Principles for Teaching Science, they write,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is a particular way of knowing about the world. In science, explanations
are limited to those based on observations and experiments that can be reproduced and substantiated by other scientists. Explanations that cannot be based on empirical evidence are not a part of science. … [S]cience cannot comment on the role that supernatural forces might play in such events because such hypotheses cannot be tested and are outside the realm of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one teaches anything to the contrary. Why do they bring supernaturalism into a discussion of science anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Scientific knowledge is subject to modifications as new information challenges prevailing theories and as a new theory leads to looking at old observations in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Some matters cannot be examined usefully in a scientific way. Among them are matters that by their nature cannot be tested objectively and those that are essentially matters of theology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, pabulum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;- No matter how well one theory fits observations, a new theory might fit them just as well or better, or might fit a wider range of observations. In science, the testing, revising, and occasional discarding of theories, new and old, never ends. This ongoing process leads to an increasingly better understanding of how things work in the world, but not to absolute truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah! Now we get down to brass tacks.  Though this statement is technically true and was emphatically true before the development of modern science, it seems extremely unlikely that any mature scientific theory will ever be completely overturned. Rather, it will be extended or shown to be accurate only within a range of validity, as Newtonian physics is accurate with low velocities and largish masses. The theory of evolution, in particular, will not be discarded; &lt;em&gt;descent with modification&lt;/em&gt;, which is commonly called evolution, is an established fact, and the modern theory of evolution, which is also commonly called evolution, accounts for descent with modification brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Teachers are encouraged to include discussions of alternate scientific theories and the data that supports and contradicts [sic] existing theories. This is consistent with the Poudre School District policy IMB: “Teaching about Controversial/SensitiveIssues.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What alternate scientific theories? If they mean an alternative to the modern theory of evolution, there is none. “Alternate scientific theories” is code for casting doubt on a well-established theory and opening the door to creationism. No one who reads that paragraph will think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Students should understand the difference between science based on direct observation and/or experimentation, and historical science, which is based on the study of past events. Historical science can be found in the fields of astronomy,geology, evolutionary biology, and archeology, and has led to such theories as the”Big Bang,” tectonic plate theory, and the theory of evolution. Because it is based on past events, historical science generally depends on a higher degree of inference than science based on direct observation and experimentation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that inferences based on “historical” science are any weaker than inferences based on direct experimentation is particularly insidious. In science, we use logic and evidence, and scientific evidence that is based on past events is as good as any other scientific evidence and just as amenable to logic. In short, an inference is an inference; you can convict someone of murder by videotaping him committing that murder, or you can use a chain of circumstantial inferences (it was his gun, his fingerprints were on it, he had traces of gunpowder on his hands, he left a footprint, he was seen leaving the building at the right time, he had a motive, and so on) to arrive just as firmly at the same conclusion.  Similarly, just as no one has ever seen a living dinosaur, no one has ever seen an electron; we infer the existence of dinosaurs and electrons in precisely the same way. Even so, had we never discovered a single fossil, we still would have developed the theory of evolution based on other lines of evidence; evolution is not a historical science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Principles for Teaching Evolution, they continue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;· A clear and accurate description of terminology will be taught. The term”evolution” has become highly politicized and often misused to include a very broad spectrum of processes; [sic] from genetic mutation to gradual change over time to the origin of the human species. It is essential to distinguish between manifestations of evolution which can be directly observed and reproduced in the laboratory (microevolution of prokaryotic cells) and those which cannot be experimentally reproduced and involve a higher level of inference and historical science (macroevolution, origin of species[,] etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See above, under “historical science.” The claim that microevolution is somehow real but macroevolution cannot happen is not supported by any scientific investigation. To the contrary, there is no clear demarcation between microevolution and macroevolution, and  macroevolution is usually little more than a long sequence of microevolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;· In this context it is important to note that many biology textbooks present all aspects of evolution—from microevolution to macroevolution—as being equally supported by experimental and empirical evidence. Liberty will strive to accurately present the strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary theory and seek textbooks which present a more scientific and unbiased analysis of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a creationist canard. Microevolution and macroevolution, to the extent that the distinction is meaningful, are equally well supported by lines of inference from taxonomy, genetics, the fossil record, biogeography, and more. It is inexcusable to claim that textbooks written by experts in their fields present unscientific and biased analyses of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Discussions of evolutionary theory can lead to discussions of whether or not supernatural forces play a role in the mechanism of evolution or the origin of life. These topics extend beyond the scope of science and will not be taught at Liberty Common School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am gratified to read that last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I checked out another charter school, the Peak-To-Peak Charter School in Boulder. I could not find a science policy, but I found this no-nonsense description of an advanced-placement biology course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science 90: Advanced Placement Biology&lt;/strong&gt;: 10 credits. Weighted. &lt;em&gt;Prerequisites: Science 20 or 25 and Science 30 or 35 and departmental approval.&lt;/em&gt; This is a full-year course in general biology as commonly offered to college freshmen. The course prepares students to take the AP Biology exam in the spring. Students will explore molecules, cells, heredity, evolution, organisms, and populations. The themes of science as a process, energy transfer, continuity and change, relationship of structure to function, regulation, interdependence in nature, and science, technology, &amp;amp; society are woven throughout the course. The course places a heavy emphasis on laboratory investigations, with 12 required labs designed specifically for AP Biology. Students in this course are expected to take the AP Biology exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a word about supernaturalism, teaching the controversy, macroevolution, alternate scientific theories. Why not? Because not one of those topics is relevant to teaching biology in a public school. Why then does Liberty Common have an explicit science policy, and why does it single out biology almost exclusively? I can’t read their minds, but I can suggest two possible reasons: First, to send a coded message to parents who want creationism taught to their children. Second, to cover their collective flanks, so that when they are challenged they can say that they told the school district all along what they intended to do and they were permitted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledgments. Jason Wiles, Kim Johnson, Richard Hoppe, and Paul Gross read and commented on this article, but I alone am responsible for any errors or omissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix. I do not want to review a movie I have never seen, but I recommend these articles about “Waiting for Superman”: Dana Goldstein in &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/154986/grading-waiting-superman" rel="external "&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;, Rick Ayers in the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-ayers-/an-inconvenient-superman-_b_716420.html" rel="external "&gt; Huffington Post &lt;/a&gt;, Gail Collins in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/opinion/30collins.html" rel="external "&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and Brent Staples in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/opinion/02sat4.html" rel="external "&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. It is a bit off task (after all, what is an Appendix for?), but I would like to allow Gail Collins the last word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But plot-wise, the movie seems to suggest that what’s needed is more charter schools, which get taxpayer dollars but are run outside the regular system, unencumbered by central bureaucracy or, in most cases, unions. However, about halfway through, the narrator casually mentions that only about a fifth of American charter schools “produce amazing results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes found that only 17 percent did a better job than the comparable local public school, while more than a third did “significantly worse.” …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the matter of teachers’ unions. Guggenheim is the man who got us worried about global warming in “An Inconvenient Truth.” In his new film, the American Federation of Teachers, a union, and its president, Randi Weingarten, seem to be playing the role of carbon emissions. The movie’s heroes are people like the union-fighting District of Columbia schools chancellor, Michelle Rhee, and Geoffrey Canada, the chief of the much-praised, union-free Harlem Children’s Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to be able to get rid of teachers that we know aren’t able to teach kids,” says Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s unarguable, and the Obama administration’s Race to the Top program has turned out to be a terrific engine for forcing politicians and unions and education experts to create better ways to get rid of inept or lazy teachers. But there’s no evidence that teachers’ unions are holding our schools back. Finland, which is currently cleaning our clock in education scores, has teachers who are almost totally unionized. The states with the best student performance on standardized tests tend to be the ones with the strongest teachers’ unions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others know him too; this is the guy who CC's his rants against me to every member of the faculty at my university. He's definitely mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also lives in Montreal, where I was this weekend for the AAI convention, and would you believe that he actually showed up! A while after someone pulled a fire alarm in the hotel, he appeared in the hall, ranted and raged and argued incoherently with a few of the attendees, and then…&lt;i&gt;ran away&lt;/i&gt;. Really! He ran off! I was right there in the hall, and &lt;i&gt;I missed him&lt;/i&gt;! I'm so disappointed. Apparently, though, in his swift and flighty passage through the room, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticfriends.org/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=13526&amp;amp;whichpage=2#185044"&gt;he spotted me and then fled to the lobby to brag online about seeing me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;go post this up on "pharnygula". I've had an opportunity to see PZ's ugly face in real life! I am spamming the world from the Delta Hotel where the convention is taking place....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. He's crazy &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's what you really want to know. &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/skeptics-157/members/13047960/"&gt;Tessa Brown&lt;/a&gt; got a good photo of the loon who has been so pitifully harrassing us on the internet, and here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame he didn't have the courage to actually talk to me. I would have invited him out to the hotel bar for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 25, America’s favorite daytime think tank, &lt;em&gt;Fox and Friends&lt;/em&gt;, alleged that vaccines cause autism, and that the US government is covering it up. And because this is Fox News, the story comes packaged in outrage: the US Federal Court of Claims is asking parents for a medical expert’s opinion of how the injury may have occurred. Apparently, it’s not enough to merely allege injury in court – one must offer a rational explanation for how it could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The letter basically asked us to provide them with a theory of why we believe the vaccines caused the autism, and to provide them with a medical expert’s opinion, which is the difficult part,” explained Dana Hall, who appears to be speaking for all 5,000 petitioners in the Autism Omnibus Proceedings, to outraged Fox Friend Alisyn Camerota. “We have the theories. We are not able to find medical experts who are willing to come forth and risk losing their medical license and to help our children.” Furthermore, said Hall, the evidence exists to link vaccines to autism – “it’s just a matter of looking in the right places.” Because Hall took her case to Fox News, there was no attempt to follow up with fair and balanced questions, such as “Why would a medical expert face professional sanctions for giving an evidence-based opinion?”, or “Why didn’t the petitioners’ attorneys and medical experts look in the right places for the evidence that vaccines cause autism?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camerota, in full mama grizzly mode, brought on Mary Holland, who advocates for the ironically-named &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/672"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt;. The letter was “the end of the line”, she said, for the 5,000 parents who saw their children regress into autism following vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Autism Omnibus Proceeding has been going on for over eight years with these 5,000 claims,” she explained. “They tested two theories (sic) – one that mercury in vaccines causes autism, and one that MMR causes autism. And they decided in six test cases no. Two of those cases were appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed those decisions.” The letter that went to parents, said Holland, said “look, if you don’t have something different from these six test cases, let us know. Give us medical evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the petitioners’ lawyers chose their strongest cases from 5,000 claims, and were allowed to bring in as many experts as they needed to make their strongest arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It sounds like they are making the families jump through almost impossible legal hoops,” said Camerota. “They want parents to go out an hire their own experts, come up with a new medical theory. Why are they making it so tough?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. What ever happened to personal responsibility? One more thing to blame the socialists for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court of federal claims believes that it went through the steps it needed to go through. I don’t see it that way,” said Holland, who has written guest editorials for the Age of Autism, a fringe anti-vaccine website. “We don’t think the process is fair. It is not a normal court. No normal judge, no normal jury, no rules of evidence, no rules of civil procedure. It was set up to be an administrative proceeding, and now it’s trying to act like a court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Camerota had done her homework, she would have known that “vaccine court” was created during the Reagan Administration because the “nearly impossible legal hoops” that parents faced in vaccine injury cases were clogging up courts and forcing manufacturers out of the business.  The “not normal” rules that Holland excoriates work in favor of parents. Simply put, if vaccine A is known to cause side effect B within X days following vaccination (called a table injury), and the facts of a case line up with the table injury, the case is usually settled. It’s a “more likely than not” standard of evidence that is nowhere near what plaintiffs face in civil court. In addition, plaintiff’s legal costs are covered win or lose, and decisions are reached much faster than would occur in civil court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, few if any of the 5,000 claims would have stood a chance in civil court, where parents pay huge legal bills, and judges are bound by far tougher rules of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camerota, stepping out of character, did ask Holland one intelligent question: “We’ve heard from medical experts on this show who say that vaccines don’t cause autism. Why do you think the federal government found that when so many parents feel differently?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Holland easily wriggled off the hook – “In this proceeding (the court) didn’t find the evidence convincing,” which is like saying “We lost because the other side scored more points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This story is not over,” Holland continued. “The science is going forward. One day we will look back at this proceeding in shame. It was not a fair trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this tale of woe to Fox &amp;amp; Friends doesn’t make it anymore so.&lt;/p&gt;

Cannabis snobs have been known to argue endlessly about the quality of the highs produced by their favorite varietals: Northern Lights, Hawaiian Haze, White Widow, etc. Among dedicated potheads, debates about the effects of specific cannabis strains are often overheated, and, ultimately, kind of boring. It&amp;#39;s a bit like listening to a discussion of whether the wine in question evinces a woody aftertaste or is, instead, redolent of elderberries. For most people, the true essence of wine drinking is pretty straightforward: a drug buzz, produced by a 12 to 15 % concentration of ethyl alcohol derived from grapes, which can be had in a spectrum of varietal flavors. 

However, there is no doubting that, unlike the case of wine, different strains of marijuana can have markedly different psychoactive effects. With weed, it&amp;#39;s not just a matter of taste. 

Over the past couple of years, the cannabis debate has taken a nasty turn, after British scientists published several controversial studies suggesting that high-THC &amp;quot;skunk&amp;quot; cannabis was responsible for increased mental problems among young people--including an increased risk of developing the symptoms of schizophrenia. British drug policy makers have continued to lead the charge on this, with mixed results. See my earlier post. 

Recently, a study published in the British Journal Of Psychiatry concluded that marijuana high in THC--including so-called &amp;quot;skunk&amp;quot; cannabis--caused markedly more memory impairment than varieties of marijuana containing less THC. 

In an article at Nature News, Arran Frood spelled out the details of the study:

&amp;quot;Curran and her colleagues traveled to the homes of 134 volunteers, where the subjects got high on their own supply before completing a battery of psychological tests designed to measure anxiety, memory recall and other factors such as verbal fluency when both sober and stoned. The researchers then took a portion of the stash back to the laboratory to test how much THC and cannabidiol it contained....  Analysis showed that participants who had smoked cannabis low in cannabidiol were significantly worse at recalling text than they were when not intoxicated. Those who smoked cannabis high in cannabidiol showed no such impairment.&amp;quot;

The two main ingredients in cannabis are THC and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD shows less affinity for the two main types of cannabis receptors, CB1 and CB2, meaning that it attaches to receptors more weakly, and activates them less robustly, than THC.  The euphoric effects of marijuana are generally attributed to THC content, not CBD content. In fact, there appears to be an inverse ratio at work. According to a paper in Neuropsychopharmacology, &amp;quot;Delta-9-THC and CBD can have opposite effects on regional brain function, which may underlie their different symptomatic and behavioral effects, and CBD&amp;#39;s ability to block the psychotogenic effects of delta-9-THC.&amp;quot; 

So, CBD specifically does not produce the usual marijuana high with accompanying euphoria and forgetfulness and munchies. What the researchers found was that pot smokers suffering memory impairment and those showing normal memory &amp;quot;did not differ in the THC content of the cannabis they smoked. Unlike the marked impairment in prose recall of individuals who smoked cannabis low in cannabidiol, participants smoking cannabis high in cannabidiol showed no memory impairment.&amp;quot;

As far as memory goes, THC content didn&amp;#39;t seem to matter. It was the percentage of CBD that controlled the degree of memory impairment, the authors concluded. &amp;quot;The antagonistic effects of cannabidiol at the CB1 receptor are probably responsible for its profile in smoked cannabis, attenuating the memory-impairing effects of THC. In terms of harm reduction, users should be made aware of the higher risk of memory impairment associated with smoking low-cannabidiol strains of cannabis like &amp;#39;skunk&amp;#39; and encouraged to use strains containing higher levels of cannabidiol.&amp;quot; 

The idea that cannabidiol may protect against THC-induced memory loss is still quite speculative.  Other research has suggested that a paucity of CB1 receptors may be protective against memory impairment. Marijuana growers select for high-THC strains, not high-CBD strains, and thus there is little data available about the CBD levels of most marijuana.

An earlier study in Behavioural Pharmacology by Aaron Ilan and others at the San Francisco Brain Research Institute did not find any connection between memory and CBD content. However, Ilan speculated in the Nature News article that the difference might have been due to methodology: In Britain, the subjects were studied using marijuana of their own choosing.  In the U.S., National Institute of Health research policy has decreed that marijuana for official research must be supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). And if there is one thing many researchers seem to agree on, it is that NIDA weed &amp;quot;is notorious for being low in THC and poor quality.&amp;quot;

But CBD still does something, and that something just might be pain relief.  Lester Grinspoon, a long-time marijuana researcher at Harvard Medical School, thinks that if the study proves out, it could have an important impact on the medical use of marijuana. Also quoted in Nature News, Grinspoon said: &amp;quot;Cannabis with high cannabidiol levels will make a more appealing option for anti-pain, anti-anxiety and anti-spasm treatments, because they can be delivered without causing disconcerting euphoria.&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;UK readers only (for the moment). Around 1 billion people around the world – and principally in Africa – are affected by Bilharzia, River Blindness, Whipworm, Hookworm, Roundworm, Elephantiasis and Trachoma. 50p would pay for effective treatment for a single person against all seven diseases for &lt;em&gt;a whole year&lt;/em&gt;. This UK-based initiative at &lt;a href="http://50pence.org/"&gt;50pence.org&lt;/a&gt; is aimed at providing that much-needed treatment. Watch the short video, then pay your money. You can afford it. And they need to get an on-line payments system working so that folk from round the world can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

Below is my favorite image of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s from a survey of microbes across people’s bodies, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1177486"&gt;published last year in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1177486"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The inner circle shows the major lineages of bacteria found in all the subjects in each part of the body, while the ring shows the ones found in some people but not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture was stuffed away in the supplementary materials for the paper, so I missed it the first time around. I’m glad I found it–it’s a new &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man"&gt;Vitruvian man&lt;/a&gt; for our microbiomic age.&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/10/microbiome-survey.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="microbiome survey" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/10/microbiome-survey.jpg" alt="microbiome survey" width="600" height="689"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’ll be on at 21:00 Eastern time and again at midnight (&lt;a href="http://www.discoverychannel.ca/Schedule.aspx"&gt;check your local listings&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/09/bad-universe-to-premiere-in-canada-eh/"&gt;Discovery Canada is showing it&lt;/a&gt; because so many of you wonderful folks sent notes to the channel via Twitter and email. I was amazed at the response, and really overwhelmed by it. So here’s your chance to get a look. And if you’re wondering what I’m talking about, I have to assume that a) this is your very first time on this blog or having contact with me in any way, and 2) you haven’t read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/08/29/advance-bad-universe-reviews-are-in/"&gt;the reviews&lt;/a&gt; saying Bad Universe is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/08/31/a-few-more-bad-universe-reviews/"&gt;the greatest show&lt;/a&gt; since anything Lorne Green, Michael J. Fox, and William Shatner have ever done&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So help out a fellow Canadian (well, honorary Canadian… well, OK, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZVG9Ji08xg"&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like Canada&lt;/a&gt;) and give it a look-see. And if you like it, please send the good folks at Discovery Channel a nice note or at least &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DiscoveryCanada/status/24024192203"&gt;follow them on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; send them a nice note).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you tonight! And thanks for watching. Oh- and of course, Episode 2, called &amp;quot;Alien Attack!&amp;quot; airs on the U.S. Discovery Channel Wednesday night after MythBusters. I’ll be having another giveaway contest for that starting Monday, so check back here tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the reluctance of the media to report important negative results is, in part, to blame..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B vitamins are a favourite of the fraudulent supplements industry. One of theit pet propositions is that they will prevent dementia. The likes of Patrick Holford were, no doubt, delighted when a study  from Oxford University, published on September 8th, seemed to confirm their ideas. The paper was &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012244"&gt;Homocysteine-Lowering   by B Vitamins Slows the Rate of Accelerated Brain Atrophy in Mild   Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;.  (Smith AD, Smith SM, de Jager CA, Whitbread P, Johnston C, et al. (2010)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this paper was that it did not measure dementia at all, but a surrogate outcome, brain shrinkage. There are other problems too. They were quickly pointed out in blogs, particularly by the excellent Carl Heneghan of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, at &lt;a href="http://trusttheevidence.net/carl-heneghan/vitamin-b-and-slowing-the-rate-of-brain-atrophy-the-numbers-don%E2%80%99t-add-up/100909109"&gt;Vitamin B and slowing the rate of Brain Atrophy: the numbers don’t add up&lt;/a&gt;.  Some detailed comments on this post were posted at Evidence Matters, &lt;a href="http://evidencematters.posterous.com/david-smith-b-vitamins-and-alzheimers-disease"&gt;David Smith, B vitamins and Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper was reported very widely indeed. A Google search for ‘Vitamin B Alzheimer’s Smith 2010′ gives over 90,000 hits at the time of posting. Most of those I’ve checked report this paper uncritically. The Daily Mail headline was &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1310330/Vitamin-B-halts-memory-loss-10p-pill-beat-Alzheimers-disease.html"&gt;10p pill to beat Alzheimer’s disease: Vitamin B halts memory loss in breakthrough British trial&lt;/a&gt;, though in fairness to Fiona MacRae, she did include at the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The Alzheimer’s Society gave the research a cautious welcome. Professor Clive Ballard said: ‘This could change the lives of thousands of people at risk of dementia. However, previous studies looking at B vitamins have been very disappointing and we wouldn’t want to raise people’s expectations yet.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That caution was justified because a mere two weeks later, on September 22nd, another paper appeared,  in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;..  The paper is &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/ford-b-vits-dementia-2010.pdf"&gt;Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and folic acid for cognition in older men&lt;/a&gt;, by Ford &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.  It appears to contradict directly Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. but it didn’t measure the same thing.  This one measured what actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The primary outcome of interest was the change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). A secondary aim of the study was to determine if supplementation with vitamins decreased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia over 8 years.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion was negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;: The daily supplementation of vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid does not benefit cognitive function in older men, nor does it reduce the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disgracefully, this paper has hardly been reported at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an excellent example of how the public is misled because of the reluctance of the media to publish negative results. Sadly that reluctance is sometimes also shown by academic journals, but not in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things went wrong, The first was near-universal failure to evaluate critically the Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; paper. The second was to ignore the paper that measured what actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t as though there wasn’t a bit of relevant history, Prof Smith was one of the scientific advisors for Patrick Holford’s Food for the Brain survey. This survey was, quie rightly, criticised for being uninterpretable. When asked about this, Smith admitted as much, as recounted in &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=218"&gt;Food for the Brain: Child Survey. A proper job?&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty has been written about &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Patrick+Holford%22"&gt;Patrick Holford&lt;/a&gt;, here and elsewhere.  There is even a web site that is largely devoted to dispelling his myths, &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/"&gt;Holford Watch&lt;/a&gt;.  He merited an enture chapter in Ben Goldacre’s book, &lt;em&gt;Bad Science&lt;/em&gt;.  He is an archetypal pill salesman and the sciencey talk seems to be largely used as a sales tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been relevant too, to notice that the Smith &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; paper stated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competing interests&lt;/strong&gt;: Dr. A. D. Smith is named as an inventor on two patents held by the University of Oxford on the use of folic acid to treat Alzheimer’s disease (US6008221; US6127370); under the University’s rules he could benefit financially if the patent is exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, no reason to think that the interpretation of the data was influenced by he fact that the first author had a financial interest in the outcome.  In fact university managers encourage that sort of thing strongly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m more in sympathy with the view expressed by Strohman (1997) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“academic biologists and corporate researchers have become indistinguishable, and special awards are given for collaborations between these two sectors for behaviour that used to be cited as a conflict of interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitamin pills, &lt;em&gt;caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the story here?  Obviously, these 40+ identical tweets and identical blog posts are the product of some kind of chiropractic practice-building service.  The chiropractor is given a tweet and a blog post with a few blanks to be filled in with the chiropractor&amp;#39;s own name name and home town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they work?  Well, it certainly generates revenue for the practice-building consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamic Chiropractic &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="http://www.mpamedia.com/aboutus/"&gt;part of a stable of print and online publishing enterprises &lt;/a&gt;serving the &amp;quot;alternative health and wellness industry.&amp;quot;  &lt;a href="http://www.jvsr.com/authors/index.asp?ID=465"&gt;Christopher Kent&lt;/a&gt;, who is an attorney and chiropractor, recently published a column there entitled &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=54923"&gt;Is There An Oversupply of D.C.s?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  My short answer is yes; Kent&amp;#39;s is that chiropractors need to branch out into providing non-evidence-based services.  In other words, increase the quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is discussed at &lt;a href="http://chirotalk.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;amp;board=outlook&amp;amp;thread=4940&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Chirotalk: The Skeptical Chiropractic Discussion Forum&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;. One participant who went to chiropractic school as a mid-life career change wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had several other college degrees, I realized quickly that chiropractic school is not like other professional schools. It&amp;#39;s basically a trade school run by profit-motivated administrators. Each school is a discreet entity eyeing the others suspiciously as competition. The common good of the profession isn&amp;#39;t an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are quite right about medical schools limiting their enrollment based on the number of MDs expected to leave the profession through retirement, death, or attrition each year. Did you know that this is done in every profession I can think of except chiropractic? As long as chiropractic schools operate from the mindset of proprietary trade schools, that will never change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-school mentality grew naturally out of our exclusion (some of it self-imposed) from traditional university settings. (We used the academic title &amp;quot;doctor&amp;quot; long before we were really academics.) Many of our predecessors had very limited education, but a strong entrepreneurial spirit. That can-do, make-a-buck way of looking at the world, coupled with rejection of and by the academic establishment, made for training arenas that looked more like beauty colleges than institutes of higher learning. The federal student loan programs made money available, and the exemplars cashing in on the high-dollar days of insurance parity brought in students in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balloon is deflating now, of course. The growth of the profession is being regulated - by harsh reality! Hundreds of new grads are waiting tables and tending bar, and mountainous student loans in deferment and on the Ford plan grow unrecognized as the bad debts that they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Steven Barrett MD points out, &lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/03Edu/ooh_2010.html"&gt;income for chiropractors has been falling for 20 years&lt;/a&gt; and there is no sign it will improve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286128052904"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8282121266048312442">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7418ea898b3c0ea8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Defending the Christian Faith Makes Brilliant People Look Stupid...</title><published>2010-10-03T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T12:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/ItQE4dlAfzM/defending-christian-faith-makes.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8282121266048312442/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8282121266048312442" title="5 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/10/defending-christian-faith-makes.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Yep, &lt;a href="http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2010/10/insider-test-for-infidels.html"&gt;just click and read through this&lt;/a&gt;.

In what I view as one of the most amazing adaptations of the human immune system, it too has evolved ways in which to deal with infected cells which inhibit the activation of MHC-I: natural killer cells.  Where as CD-8 T-cells respond to cells expressing MHC-I, natural killer cells respond to those cells which suddenly stop expressing MHC-I.  Either expression or lack there of will result in the destruction of the infected cell. The whole notion of MHC-I may seem unusual, but to understand it, consider that all cells have MHC-I.  In its normal state it simply expresses a, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m content,&amp;quot; message.  CD-8 T-cells accept this message and ignore the cell.  Meanwhile natural killer cells avoid such a cell as well, since it does express a MHC-I.  When infected the cell should change it&amp;#39;s MHC-I to a, &amp;quot;HELP!&amp;quot; which would activate CD-8 T-cells.  If, however, a virus has evolved to remove MHC-I presentation, no CD-8 T-cells will respond.  In this case, natural killer cells take over for CD-8 T-cells, and kill the infected cell.Despite thorough searching for such research, I have found none.  However, I did stumble upon a study which looked into co-infection.  Since different strains can co-infect the same cell, this creates a new and potentially groundbreaking area of immunologic research.  Just consider: what if I infect a cell with two different viruses, each causing a separate immune response?  Might not one response unexpectedly help to protect from the other, perhaps in a way in which the host cell had not anticipated?  This can go the other way as well, much like Hepatitis D requires co-infection with Hepatitis B in order to setup shop. Nonetheless cancer and HIV research, as well as the newly recognized problem of antibiotic resistance, have helped to push immunology to the forefront of research.  I imagine that a decade from now we will look back at today as the mere infancy of our understanding of immunology.Rémy Froissart, Claus O.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With the first painting of the rock in the 1940s, it became a canvas for student art, opinions, advertising, messages, proposals, and jokes. Tradition holds that if a student wishes to paint something on the Rock, he or she must guard it from sunup until the early morning hours (24 hours) before painting. Many student groups start guarding even earlier to ensure that they will be able to claim the Rock for whatever event or date is being advertised.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Humanists for Inquiry and FreeThought (SHIFT) secured The Rock on Blasphemy Day, painted it completely white, and encouraged students to &lt;a href="http://thenushift.blogspot.com/2010/10/international-blasphemy-rights-day-2010.html"&gt;write anything they wanted on it, blasphemous or not&lt;/a&gt; — over 100 students ended up participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdIXqdtr8I/AAAAAAAAABg/ljcYDnhcWpQ/s1600/62155_1471484958445_1573260092_31430850_5341260_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdIXqdtr8I/AAAAAAAAABg/ljcYDnhcWpQ/s1600/62155_1471484958445_1573260092_31430850_5341260_n.jpg" title="TheRock1" width="540" height="720"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little religious blashpemy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdcsjWFoYI/AAAAAAAAACI/TzjeMyZixDQ/s1600/blasphemy1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdcsjWFoYI/AAAAAAAAACI/TzjeMyZixDQ/s1600/blasphemy1.jpg" title="TheBibleSays" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdi-i2da9I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/U5e-SQKvfbA/s1600/matt1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdi-i2da9I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/U5e-SQKvfbA/s1600/matt1.jpg" title="PedoPope" width="540" height="720"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of blapshemy that wasn’t religious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdh-MnYRQI/AAAAAAAAAHA/wQOq28mbdBg/s1600/33579_1471479718314_1573260092_31430804_6778827_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdh-MnYRQI/AAAAAAAAAHA/wQOq28mbdBg/s1600/33579_1471479718314_1573260092_31430804_6778827_n.jpg" title="WhyIsThisOutofOrder?" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little opposition to the blasphemy… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKeJl3UZ12I/AAAAAAAAALA/vRgvHmiHuNM/s1600/39295_1471474718189_1573260092_31430769_6913600_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKeJl3UZ12I/AAAAAAAAALA/vRgvHmiHuNM/s1600/39295_1471474718189_1573260092_31430769_6913600_n.jpg" title="BelieveGod" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of PostSecret…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdesP_TZmI/AAAAAAAAAEo/NOpAOxaSVxw/s1600/postsecret5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdesP_TZmI/AAAAAAAAAEo/NOpAOxaSVxw/s1600/postsecret5.jpg" title="PostSecret" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little appreciation…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdfblShk4I/AAAAAAAAAFg/SVY0_mCJ5zQ/s1600/happy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdfblShk4I/AAAAAAAAAFg/SVY0_mCJ5zQ/s1600/happy.jpg" title="Liberating" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;strike&gt;little&lt;/strike&gt; lot of penises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdgwPkqDlI/AAAAAAAAAFw/9jur52UIr1s/s1600/penis.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wWJfapvAmZc/TKdgwPkqDlI/AAAAAAAAAFw/9jur52UIr1s/s1600/penis.jpg" title="Penis" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="http://thenushift.blogspot.com/2010/10/international-blasphemy-rights-day-2010.html"&gt;whole slew of additional pictures here&lt;/a&gt;.   And, if you can access it, even &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2065146&amp;amp;id=1573260092&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;more on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/shift-turns-the-rock-into-a-canvas-1.2351044"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Northwestern&lt;/em&gt; covered the event&lt;/a&gt;.  The reactions reported in the piece are all the more reason to try this again next year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We’re all pretty good at blaspheming,” said Harry Noble, [SHIFT&amp;#39;s] events coordinator. “We figured we’d give the rest of the campus a try.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While several writings attacked religion, no one appeared to attempt to draw the Prophet Muhammad — a controversial action that has been associated with SHIFT since last spring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One student who stopped to write on the Rock, Emily Kaht, said she was surprised at some of the images and phrases students had chosen to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m kind of disappointed that NU students, on the whole, are so profane and judgmental,” the Weinberg sophomore said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaht wrote two phrases on the Rock, she said — one that said “Rachel isn’t good enough for Finn,” a reference to the show Glee and the phrase, “That is real,” to which someone added “-ly gay.” Kaht said she was offended by the addition and planned to cross it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though some students were offended, SHIFT members said the day was a success. The group plans to repeat the event next year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It looked perfect,” [SHIFT president Cassy] Byrne said. “It was exactly as we envisioned it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these events that encourage people to write things they would normally fear saying.  Let them blaspheme, whatever that word might mean to the artists.  Yes, that means some admittedly offensive, mean-spirited, untrue things could be included in the list… but the whole point is to have one place on one day where you can say anything you want without any fear of repercussion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of those statements may rightfully be cause for punishment in the “real world,” not all of them are.  Like religious criticism.  Let’s not be afraid of calling out religious beliefs as mythical, foolish, and harmful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/upload/2010/10/the_following_cartoon_has_been/Non%20Sequitur.png" width="201" height="800" alt="Non Sequitur.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Daily Cartoonist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Universal Uclick has confirmed that several papers (upwards of 20) have asked for a replacement for this Sunday's Non Sequitur because it mentions the word "Muhammad." The cartoon by Wiley Miller  depicts a lazy, sunny park scene with the caption, "Picture book title voted least likely to ever find a publisher... 'Where's Muhammad?'" Characters in the park are buying ice cream, fishing, roller skating, etc. No character is depicted as even Middle Eastern....

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2010/09/28/papers-pulling-non-sequitur-because-of-muhammad-mention/"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I feel this is relevant to what follows; as the son of Indian immigrants, who grew up in Red-as-Red-can-be territory, I admit to feeling queasy about a coalition with the Conservative party – indeed I'm with Tim Farron when he says he joined the Lib Dems in the '80s for the same reason others joined the Tories – Margaret Thatcher. And yet pragmatic politics and the chance to implement so much of what our party believes in sees Lib Dem MPs sit around the Cabinet table and for the Coalition government – and so it was in the spirit of good faith and cross-party collaboration that a group of bloggers – the &lt;a href="http://millenniumelephant.blogspot.com/"&gt;Millennium Elephant&lt;/a&gt; (accompanied by his loyal Daddy Richard Flowers), Alex Wilcock (better known online as author of &lt;a href="http://loveandliberty.blogspot.com/"&gt;Love and Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, a Lib Dem blog post of the year award nominee), &lt;a href="http://www.maryreid.org.uk/blog/"&gt;Councillor Mary Reid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://helenduffett.blogspot.com/"&gt;Helen Duffet&lt;/a&gt; interviewed &lt;a href="http://www.oliverletwinmp.com/"&gt;Oliver Letwin MP&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Liberation Serif&amp;#39;,serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;Imme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;diately before our interview began Mary and I attended a fringe meeting with Oliver, Danny Alexander MP (Chief Secretary to the Treasury) and TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber discussing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;how the balance of public to private sector jobs is likely to change as the economic recovery progresses' – in other words, the path from economic failure to success. Mr Letwin's views were part classic Tory – the prioritisation of deficit reduction was prominent, although only marginally more so than in Mr. Alexander's eyes – and part 'soggy liberal'  - Mr. Letwin's own words. Indeed, there were times in the fringe meeting when I couldn't nail down the real Oliver Letwin – the deficit hawk determined to rid the nation of its debts, or the thinking liberal, conscious of the effect that spending cuts may have on the poorest, not only domestically but throughout the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;Liberation Serif&amp;#39;,serif;font-size:medium"&gt;The interview itself that followed help clear a lot up – not least because Mr. Letwin was forthcoming and engaging. We began with a double-barrelled question that was a revised version of one that Alex asks Lib Dem interviewees - what does the Tory party stand for, and why should people vote for you? Mr Letwin rolled the answers to both into a package that wouldn't sound unfamiliar or uncomfortable to any Liberal Democrat - that the Conservatives stood for a shift of power from the centre down to individuals, and that a major reason to vote Tory is that they took the step towards Coalition, demonstrating that they could govern in the national interest as well as in their own. So far as intentions once in government go, then, not a millions miles away from the Lib Dem position on things - not too surprising given the praise Mr. Letwin heaped on his coalition partners, not least Danny Alexander, in the preceding fringe meeting, speaking of their 'intellectual prowess some of us [Tories] would be proud of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;A clever ruse to win favour or genuine admiration? Judge for yourself from what followed...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Richard Flowers followed with a question about timing - why, if the Big Society was to be the Tory manifesto's centrepiece, did we not hear about it a year, two years ago? Mr. Letwin contended that the media simply didn't bite - until a few weeks before the election, when they suddenly shone a light on what the Big Society would mean for public service delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;In addition, Mr. Letwin told us that despite Labour's talk of decentralisation, they retained a faith that central government was the key to reforming the nation; something that the Coalition parties hold to be untrue, and that, in Mr. Letwin's view, would be seen as a truism in five years time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Speaking of the Big Society, Helen asked whether people really did want to take control of services for themselves; don't most folks just want the government to run schools/hospitals/parks and so on? Letwin's response was simple - services should be run by those who know how. Fine, said Mary (who retired in 2010 as a councillor in Kingston upon Thames); what about democratic accountability - what is the role of local government if the Big Society is rolled out? Mr. Letwin used the opportunity to wax lyrical about empowering local government by releasing them from central diktat; that accountability would increase once payment by results was introduced; that by increasing patient information, there would be 'no decision about me, without me' in the NHS; and that with local authorities acting as advocates for people in a competitive marketplace, it would be like having a lawyer represent your best interests in court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;This is where I feel Mr. Letwin's Conservative vision has a lot to answer for; it's all very well offering choice and competition in public services, as long as everyone - and that means everyone - has the capability to exercise said choice - because failing that there's the risk the vulnerable will be left behind. I noted an absence detail in how the poor, the marginalised, the vulnerable will fare in the Big Society - just as well we're in government with them then :-).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;A question I raised gave rise to an interesting discourse; Mr. Letwin criticised Labour's 'faith' in centralised institutions - how do we know the Big Society isn't faith-based as well? Well, Mr. Letwin's answer was enough to keep me interested: this, Oliver said, is where evidence-based policy-making comes in; once the reforms we heard about came in, their effect must be reviewed - and only on the basis of efficacy should they be continued. This reliance on evidence and not dogma was repeated when Richard pushed the line of questioning to the fiscal tightening to come - yes said Mr. Letwin, we must make sure that cuts are monitored, so that we base policy decisions on what works, not what we think will work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;He then said that savings can come in the form of structural policy changes rather than just cutting services - what I found interesting was that the example he gave was that of drugs policy; that in shifting drugs policy to harm reduction, and introducing localised payment by result, we could save millions on prison bills, emergency hospitalisations and so on. Enlightened, evidence-based, liberal - you had to remind yourself you were hearing all this from a Tory...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;The most interesting of all answers was to questions from Alex and Helen on the differences/commonalities between our two parties - Alex asked whether, having seen the democratic and deliberative way the Lib Dems make policy, will he recommend changing how the Conservatives work? He stopped short of saying yes but was full of praise again for Lib Dem procedures - comparing our democratic structure to the Tory 'authoritarianism tempered by regicide.' It was good to hear too that if Lib Dems passed into policy something that clashed with Conservative thinking - as in fact we had earlier in the day with the Motion calling for equal marriage for lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people - that if Lib Dem Ministers pushed for it to become government policy then Tories would have to discuss it, in good faith, and find ways of implementing it. Heartening!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;I end (if anyone's still reading...) with comments Mr. Letwin made when Helen asked him why, seeing as though he was a Young Liberal at university and he has so many views aligned with those of his coalition partners, how come he ended up a Conservative? Well, he said after a long thoughtful pause, I'll only be able to answer that once I write my memoires- until then, let's just say that I have enough in common with my fellow Conservatives to make it work. Suggests to me that the description of Mr. Letwin as a soggy liberal is taken as compliment!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;I know that, had I met someone from the Tory far right it may have been a difference experience - but I have to say that if the cordial, enlightened and mature attitude of Mr. Letwin is anything to go by, the Coalition has a really healthy future ahead of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-5697292937014043966?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286116271067"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/maher_republicans_a_deadly_ene.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36e20e9d98e0a5e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Maher: "Republicans a deadly enemy"</title><published>2010-10-03T15:14:48Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T15:14:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/B6tNr7WJuXI/maher_republicans_a_deadly_ene.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/maher_republicans_a_deadly_ene.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/lXxeiL8UV4U?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/maher_republicans_a_deadly_ene.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/B6tNr7WJuXI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286114576718"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/some_sunday_reading_for_you.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d67c4fda8ec2c7e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Some Sunday reading for you</title><published>2010-10-03T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/DNZZIOj95TE/some_sunday_reading_for_you.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/some_sunday_reading_for_you.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I recover from the joy of deadlines, I decided to take the weekend off from blogging (new material, at least).

Most of these come because of a simple statement I need to repeat often: astronomers report very few if any UFOs because for the most part, we understand what we’re seeing in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see a satellites, a glint off a distant airplane, birds, astronomical objects, lightning, or meteors, we can generally identify them and don’t need to call the police or the newspapers. The vast majority of people out there, however, are not familiar with the sky, and so when they see these things they can (understandably) freak out a little. That includes sightings of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/15/erie-ufo-sounds-familiar-to-me/"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/05/thats-no-moon-oh-wait-yes-it-is/"&gt;the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/ufo_jupiter.jpg" alt="ufo_jupiter" title="ufo_jupiter" width="300" height="375"&gt;And now the king of the planets can join that list: via &lt;a href="http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=5664020"&gt;Fark&lt;/a&gt; comes the news that residents of Washington state have been calling the police&lt;a href="http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20101001/NEWS/101009999/jupiter-mistaken-for-ufo"&gt; to report a UFO&lt;/a&gt; low in the east after sunset. And that UFO has turned out to be none other than the planet Jupiter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised. Jupiter is very bright and obvious in the sky right now. Since it’s getting dark earlier, people are outside when they’re not quite used to it being dark yet. And since Jupiter is rising at sunset, it’s low in the sky; people driving will see it through the window and think it’s following them. And it’s very, very common for people to think a &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;/em&gt; object is actually a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a perfect confluence of events to promote UFO sightings. I should’ve seen it coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s some good to come of this. For one, it means people are in fact going outside and looking up. That alone makes me happy. Also, these folks find out they’re looking at Jupiter, when maybe they didn’t even know they could see a planet at all (though I bet a few won’t believe the cops or papers). And the best part? The article about the Jupiter UFO reports gives some basic info about Jupiter, too. That’s great! Kudos to the Peninsula Daily News for taking this chance to get a little astronomical coolness out there to its readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since the birth of modern science in the 17th century, it has been downhill for literalism . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s a religion to do? There are two main tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan A: Treat the long, steady retreat into metaphor and mystery as a process of increasing wisdom, and try to educate the congregation to the new sophisticated understandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B: Cloak all the doctrines in a convenient fog and then not just excuse the faithful from trying to penetrate the fog, but celebrate the policy of not looking too closely at anyone’s creed – not even your own. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists tend to be those curious and truth-loving folks who do take a good hard look at religious professions of faith, and hence they tend to know what they are walking away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have always been atheists, though not always very visible to the public. In fact, the perennial nagging doubts of the few atheists in the crowd have probably been the main force sustaining theology!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those who have thought long and hard about religions – and hence know the answers – don’t actually believe the doctrines that they rightly identify as belonging to the church they are affiliated with . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know, for instance, what a good Catholic is “required to profess” as Pope Benedict (when he was Cardinal Ratzinger) often said, and so, if they are Catholics, they profess it. But they find that they cannot actually believe it. Many people maintain their loyalty as vigorous members of their denominations while quietly setting aside the dogmas, either utterly ignored as irrelevant or wreathed in protective layers of metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pew study also reveals why atheist critiques of religious doctrines are largely a waste of effort: Few people believe them in any case; they just say they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m not so sure about the last bit.  There are plenty of religious people who believe in a personal, theistic God, in the fact that they’ll live after death, in Jesus as God’s son or Mohamed as God’s prophet, and so on.  Surely that is religious doctrine, too.  Nevertheless, Dennett is surely correct that many liberal religious people are hardly distinguishable from atheists.  And it would have been unthinkable a few years ago for a paper as popular as &lt;em&gt;The Daily News&lt;/em&gt; to publish a critique like this. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the success of New Atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

I challenge all theists and all their accommodationist friends to post their very best 21st century, sophisticated (or not), arguments for the existence of God. They can put them in the comments section of this posting, or on any of the other atheist blogs, or on their own blogs and websites. Just send me the link. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try and make it concise and to the point. It would be nice if it's less than 100 years old. Keep in mind that there are over 1000 different gods so it would be helpful to explain just which gods the argument applies to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There have been over 500 comments on that posting and dozens of attempts to meet the challenge, ranging from the fact that Babylon hasn't been re-built to variations of the old Cosmological and Ontological Arguments that have been around for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it's fair to say that nobody came up with anything that even remotely resembles a modern "sophisticated" argument that the Gnu Atheists are ignoring. Therefore, I declare victory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From now on, whenever any accommdationist or theist accuses me of not having studied philosophy or theology I'll point them to my post and remind them that the Emperor really doesn't have any clothes. That includes a few people who sent me email messages explaining why they wouldn't lower themselves to post a comment on my blog. They implied that they still had some really good arguments for the existence of God but they aren't going to reveal them to me because I wouldn't understand them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-7388147659861437274?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286109468250"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=19730">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe1d5b7b0e811fac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LOLz"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="music"/><title type="html">The most beautiful girl in the lab</title><published>2010-10-03T12:37:44Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T12:37:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/the-most-beautiful-girl-in-the-lab/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many of us grad-student lab rats had feelings like this?  Before you criticize this as a geeky attempt at a romance song, be aware that it’s a parody of “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56ekY8TMJ4w&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;The Most Beautiful Girl in the Room&lt;/a&gt;” by the Conchords.

&lt;p&gt;I ignore the first point (split infinitives have always been grammatically correct in English; see for example &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/grammar/splitinf.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;). And as for the second, stranded prepositions have also always been grammatical in general, of course; but with respect to Mr Gelatt's example, I wonder what he thought the "correction" would be?  The common phrases &lt;i&gt;to start with&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;to begin with&lt;/i&gt; are among the (numerous) cases where stranding the preposition at the end of the phrase is not just permitted in Standard English, it's obligatory.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;i&gt;You can wipe that smile off your face to start with&lt;/i&gt; is grammatical in Standard English, but *&lt;i&gt;You can wipe that smile off your face with which to start&lt;/i&gt; is not.  So Mr Gelatt has it ass-backward: &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; keeping the preposition at the end here would be the grammatical error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with John McIntyre that it is a bit scary to think that this man spent a career "standing before the impressionable young" and packing their heads with arrant nonsense that editors like John ultimately have to try and rectify by returning the victims to a state in which they can write their own native language sensibly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's another illustration of why I am worried that prescriptivism harms the economy: think of the senselessly wasted thousands of hours each year as dim-witted journalism professors with old-fashioned ideas teach falsehoods about English out of hundred-year-old books of toxic waste (&lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497"&gt;you know which sort of book I mean&lt;/a&gt;) so that editorial staff members of newspapers can later spend their expensive time struggling to shake the poor graduates out of their didactogenic misconceptions and get their writing back into a state where it's fit to publish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color="#008800"&gt;Addendum: A particularly dumb comment that originally appeared below said this:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
IMHO, the words classified as "prepositions" are, in fact, prepositions ONLY when they are in the "pre-"position in prepositional phrases.  Otherwise, they are simply one-word adverbs of location or direction.  In verbal forms such as "to start with", the "with" is a meaning-mandated adverb which may occur in any normal adverbial position. If you take this view, the whole question of "stranded prepositions" simply goes away.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't bear to let such painfully misinformed pomposity ("I[n] M[y] H[umble] Opinion", indeed!) remain on the Language Log site; yet it seemed churlish to attack one of our guests.  So I deleted the comment, and present its contents anonymized here for correction.  It certainly is painfully misinformed, and I need to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling every preposition an "adverb" if it doesn't have an NP complement is the ancient tradition of stupid Latinophilia (notice the assumption that if they are called prepositions they have to be pre-positioned, in accord with the Latin etymology).  Sensible grammarians have been trying to do away with it for two hundred years.  Jespersen's &lt;i&gt;The Philosophy of Grammar&lt;/i&gt; argued for the sensible view, but others preceded him, back to the middle 18th century.  And the idea that "the whole question of 'stranded prepositions' simply goes away" under the ancient stupid view is mind-boggling. Even the proponents of the ancient stupid view agreed that in &lt;i&gt;Who are you looking at?&lt;/i&gt; we have a preposition, not an adverb; so stranding remains. The question is whether you are going to deprecate it, and follow the long tradition established by John Dryden, or get in line with all the serious grammatical descriptions of the language, one hundred percent of which agree that stranding is grammatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the commenter had not been reading Language Log for very long.  One place to start reading about the history would be "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004454.html"&gt;Hot Dryden-on-Jonson action&lt;/a&gt;" by Mark Liberman.  But search on &lt;tt&gt;preposition stranding "Langage Log"&lt;/tt&gt; would bring up a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

As such, the Greek Classical textual tradition links “God” directly with the Classical Gods and not with the Christian pagan god Yahweh. When Rome left the Gods that had made them great and became Christian, the mighty Roman empire began its decline until it was sacked. It was Christianity and its god that ushered in the Dark Ages at the end of this great Classical period.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Brad Haggard responds to Harry,&lt;blockquote&gt;1. You know you are not using lexical information correctly. Barr should have already warned you about context and semantics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I don't suppose that, oh, economics, social dynamics, politics, and military tactics had anything to do with the fall of Rome. Or, I guess then Christianity really can take credit for the Renaissance and the scientific/industrial revolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Harry responds to Brad,&lt;blockquote&gt;Would you agree that אלהים (Masoretic text) is masculine plural?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Would you also agree that ὁ θεὸς (LXX) is masculine singular?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    So, in Genesis 1:1, did an assembly of male gods create the heavens and the earth or did one god create? (If you want to play the Trinity card, then I’ll let your explain the other names of אל + prefixes in the MT text.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Can you show me why the divine name יהוה does not occur in the entire New Testament? Could it just be that “son of god” fit the Hellenic context of the Greek would while יהוה would have been an abhorrent pagan name for them, especially after the Jews were expelled from Rome in 46 CE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Secondly, my view is in line with that of Edward Gibbons The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Weather or nor Gibbons was anti-Christian, his views of the end of the Roman Empire agrees with mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Another insider's look at how Christianity really worked in the late Empire is discussed in G.W. Bowersock’s award winning book: Julian the Apostate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Julian, the grandson of Constantine, gives a horrific story about members of his own Christian family were murders and why he remained a non-Christian ("pagan", a derogatory term&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brad Haggard said...&lt;blockquote&gt;Harry, this makes me reminisce about our knock downs from a while ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I just want to talk about your first point now. Are you getting this from mythicist literature?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Elohim is not cut and dry, because the "oh" is an additive. The basic 3mp form would be "elim", which is attested in the OT. Elohim is also used for plural, but not uniformly (don't forget Barr's warning on lexical information). But the way to distinguish is really pretty simple. In Ge. 1:1 the main verb, "bara" is the 3ms form. So in this sentence, the subject is singular. This is consistent throughout Genesis 1 until 1:26, where the 1st person plural is used (you know, with the nun on the front). This is where echoes of the divine council are seen, not in 1:1. If you hold to the Documentary hypothesis, which I assume you do, I have no idea how you would make sense of the Priestly writer in Genesis 1:1 allowing for a pantheon. The divine council is more of a literary device, with most of the rest of the evidence for it coming from wisdom literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Next, as to why there is no mention of "yahweh" in the NT. All you have to do is pick up a LXX and read Psalm 1. There YHWH is translated as the Greek "kyrios". This is consistent in the LXX and makes sense because YHWH is pointed in the Masoretic as the Hebrew word for "lord", "adonai." Fast forward to the "Hellenistic" gospel of John, and what is Thomas' confession at the climax of the book upon seeing the resurrected Jesus? "Ho kyrios mou kai ho theos mou!" (My Lord and my God!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I have no idea why you bring up the Jews' expulsion from Rome in 46 AD, and it sounds like you're getting farther out on the branch here. "Son of god" is widely attested in 2nd Temple literature, so I also can't see how that would be anachronistic (don't believe me, as Thom Stark).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    If you want to keep this argument up, it's going to need some serious revision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Harry H. McCall, CET said... &lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Brad,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    First up is Elohim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    The Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible (DDD, E.J. Brill; p668) states: The usual word for ‘god’ in the Hebrew Bible is ‘elohim, a plural formation of ‘eloah, the latter being expanded from the Common Semitic noun ‘il (=Eloah). // Since the Israelite concept of divinity included all praeternatural beings, also lower deities (in modern usage referred to as ‘spirits’, ‘angels’, ‘demons’, ‘semi-gods’, and the like0 maybe called ‘elohim. (p.669)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    What follows in DDD are numerous examples of uses where אלהים is not the Judeo-Christian God, but false gods or teraphim (Gen. 31:30,32), or anonymous heavenly creatures (Ps. 8:6) and spirits of the dead (1 Sam. 28:13)also called אלהים.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    While ‘el and ‘eloah are use as proper nouns in the Hebrew Bible, ‘elohim is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Your claim that ברא makes אלהים understood a 3rd person singular carries no real weight until the time of the Massoretes (600CE -750CE) when the text was standardized as drawn both from the LXX and rabbinic traditions. This is easily verifiable by photos of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Most Hebrew Lexicons will list verbs in their Qal / three letter roots, thus ברא is defined as “to create” and not as "he (god)created” as the late 7th century vowel pointing would have it read. (On this see: Williams Holladay’s discussion of the qal in his: A Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament; Introduction, p. VIII. Plus, “to create” is not an infinitive either since it would have had the “ל” prefix to the root.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    What you have not considered in your apology is that אלהים, based on its etymology, could be anything from angles to demons doing the creating here, but I contend it means some type of “gods” for whatever reason the Temple scribe meant here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Secondly, considering Genesis 1 &amp;amp; 2 are late stories (God’s Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament, by John Day (Cambridge University Press 1985)) even if it is of the Temple / Priestly authorship, you have not attempted to explain why a monotheistic religion would have used a plural form of a Semitic language when their nearest and older neighbors at Ugarit (1300 BCE)list their main god ’il (who is the head of the Ugaritic pantheon) as well as the younger ba’al as singular!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Even older Akkadian cuneiform texts from where these mythical stories of creation and Eden are set, list their gods in the singular, be they male or female (An Illustrated Dictionary: Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, University of Texas Press, 2006).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    So again, if Yahwehism is really monotheistic, why even use an undefined plural term in Genesis 1 that can carries with it numerous meanings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Moreover, the use of יהוה אלהיםbeginning in 2:4 adds even more to the confusion in trying to identify this vague term with the Israelite creator god Yahweh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Both the terms אלהי השמים (Ugaritic: “Ba’al shamem” and Phoenician 10th century BCE) along with Yahweh are singular terms and much older than the vague and confused term used in&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Thirdly, the LXX is a running commentary on the Hebrew text (See John W. Wevers' Notes on the Greek Text of Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    The fact that the term Yahweh is not used in the New Testament points to the fact of a severe break with the original Jesus Jewish movement (represented by Peter and James) and Paul’s radical revision of Judaism which the Hellenists preserved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Both Paul’s authentic letters and the Gospels have anti-Jewish interpolations in them (See Birger Pearson’s The Emergence of the Christian Religion: Essays on Early Christianity (Trinity Press International, 1997) especially Chapter 3: 1 Thessalonians 2:13 -16: A Deutero-Pauline Interpolation, pp.58 – 74).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    This anti-Jewish polemic is placed on the lips of Jesus in the hash woes of Matthew 23:29 – 24:2 where the Jews and not just the Romans, “will crucify” (σταυρώσετε) prophets of god as if the Jews killed Jesus: “And all the people said, "His blood shall be on us and on our children!" Matt. 27: 25.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    My point about the expulsion of the Jews from Rome in 46 CE is the matrix of the anti-Jewish polemics interpolated into the New Testament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    As such, the old Jewish Hebrew god Yahweh is replaced with the Greek pagan term "θεὸς" and the more genetic term “κύριος” used in the N.T. for both men and god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Finally, as to your claim that “υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ” is “wildly attested in 2nd Temple literature” is vastly over stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    See υἱὸς in Albert-Marle Denis, Concordance Grecque Des Pseudepigraphes D’ancien Testament (Universite Catholique De Louvain, 1987, pp 755 -758) where, in a quick scan, I counted only 5 or 6 references. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Best,&lt;br&gt;    Harry&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5002576540788216031?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientiae-carnival.blogspot.com/"&gt;Welcome to the Scientiae Carnival for October!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great (and relevant to the theme of ‘&lt;em&gt;It’s been a while – what’s changed?&lt;/em&gt;‘ for this month’s Scientiae) – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.photography.si.edu/2010/09/15/phd-pioneers/"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;presents us with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Permanent Link to Ph.D. Pioneers" rel="bookmark" href="http://blog.photography.si.edu/2010/09/15/phd-pioneers/"&gt;Ph.D. Pioneers:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2009, for the first time in the history of U.S. universities, more women than men received doctoral degrees. &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/14/AR2010091400004.html?sub=AR"&gt;Reported by The Washington Post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, women hold nearly a 3-to-2 majority in both undergraduate and graduate education.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Looking through the Archive’s &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/sets/72157614810586267/"&gt;Women in Science set&lt;/a&gt; on the Flickr Commons, we can find some of the early “Ph.D. Pioneers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://biochembelle.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/whats-in-a-name/"&gt;There (And Hopefully Back Again), the blog by BioChemBelle&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; writes on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://biochembelle.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/whats-in-a-name/"&gt;‘What’s in a name?’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As she says, ‘With the &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/"&gt;Nobel Prize announcements&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, it seems even more appropriate,’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a dark side to the integration of biology, chemistry, and physics. Some have developed the attitude that if there is no biological application, then the work is unimportant. Poppycock! That is utter nonsense. Much of our understanding of the mechanisms by which enzymes act was originally based on analogies to well-characterized chemical reactions. We must take care not to stray into this form of scientific elitism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://arjendu.wordpress.com"&gt;Confused at a Higher Level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; brings a post that is sobering in its story of how we sometimes have to face the biggest hurdle – ourselves and how feeling as if despite all your hard work and well-deserved success, it is somehow WRONG! to take credit for your efforts – when it comes to promoting our career. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Permanent link to On self-promotion" rel="bookmark" href="http://arjendu.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/on-self-promotion/"&gt;On self-promotion:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Lang’s &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Shameless-Self-Promotion/45300/"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; from many years ago came to mind. He wrote, “For me, and I bet for many other academics, the need in such [review] documents to trumpet my work confidently — to argue why I am the best person for the job, or for continued employment, or for tenure and promotion, or for a course reduction, or for a grant, or a publisher — never stops feeling like shameless self-promotion.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that should be read by many of those in the Australian skeptical-sphere as well, quite frankly! Here’s to taking credit for what you do and not being smacked down for it! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://aspiringecologist.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ruminations of an Aspiring Ecologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a wonderful story of an ‘evolution’ – of their very own! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://aspiringecologist.blogspot.com/2010/10/journey-to-here.html"&gt;The Journey to Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a beautiful must-read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I was twelve, other kids mocked me by calling me “nature girl”.&lt;br&gt;
When I was thirteen, I had a great jr. high science teacher.&lt;br&gt;
When I was fourteen, I started the advanced science track in high school.&lt;br&gt;
When I was fifteen and sixteen, I mostly forgot about all that nature stuff. It was mentally on the back burner while I dealt with high school drama…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aspiringecologist.blogspot.com/2010/10/journey-to-here.html"&gt;Head to her site to see how it continues!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally,&lt;strong&gt; Fairer Science&lt;/strong&gt; is a regular contributor and I noticed this recent blog-post from them that is most definitely optimistic in tone:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fairerscience.org/fs-blogs/2010/10/you_should_get_paid_to_go_to_g.html"&gt; ‘You get paid to go to grad school!’:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things I’ve been learning are quite upsetting. One of those is that there are a number of STEM undergrads who would like to go to graduate school but say they can’t afford it. That’s right! THERE ARE NUMBERS OF BRIGHT STEM UNDERGRADS WHO DON’T KNOW THAT YOU DON’T PAY TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IN THE SCIENCES, YOU GET PAID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Fairer Science, you can pass on that information to others. Certainly a welcome change that should be emulated by other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to finish – a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://geekcalendar.co.uk"&gt;short video about the Geek Calendar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;- because this is certainly something that has changed over time: the promotion of scientists as unashamed of their passions and supporting the voice of scientific inquiry unafraid of libel laws in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Geek Calendar showcases the UK’s geek heroes in ways you will have never seen before. This is not a ‘pin-up’ calendar in the traditional sense (and no, they are not naked), instead it features interesting photos of intriguing people, reminding us of each person’s ideas, achievements and creativity. Some of our geeks are famous, some are not, some are scientists, some are artists. All are nerds to the core.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX-WLIO00Js"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX-WLIO00Js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, it may be useful to contextualise this case with others which have been featured on this blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To begin with, let's consider the following four statements:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"The British Chiropractic Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying, even though there is not a jot of evidence. This organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"- didn't know there was a Scientology 'church' on Tottenham Court Road. Just hurried past in case the stupid rubs off."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Crap! Robin Hood Airport is closed. You've got a week... otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This right wing think tank Migration Watch has conducted a study which has revealed that youth unemployment is down to migration which is obviously grossly simplistic.  The main reason for youth unemployment is the recession which was caused by the bankers and the bankers are more responsible than the migrants, and it’s fairly dangerous propaganda this kind of story. It is exactly what Mosley said in the 30s and Hitler argued in Germany."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the face of it these four statements have nothing in common.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, in respect of each of these statements, someone somewhere has thought the statement to be of such a nature that the coercive power of law should be used  against the statement's author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it happens, the authors of these statements - respectively Simon Singh, John Dixon, Paul Chambers, and Sally Bercow - are all decent and courageous individuals unwilling to just accept what the law could inflict on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in each of the first three cases, it was not easy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon Singh had to endure an adverse first instance High Court decision before the Court of Appeal took a more sensible view.  Likewise, John Dixon had to put up with a frankly bizarre finding by the Welsh Public Services Ombudsman before the wiser heads at Cardiff Council dismissed the complaint.  The appeal by Paul Chambers (another of my clients) is part-heard, and one can only hope that his conviction by the Magistrates' Court is overturned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It really should not be so difficult to defend free expression; but to do so is time-consuming and costly.  Simon Singh lost two years of his writing career; Paul Chambers has so far lost two jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it is deeply disappointing how much disregard there is by public bodies and the courts for free expression.  The High Court in Simon Singh's case and the Welsh Public Services Ombudsman with the complaint against John Dixon could not have made the decisions they did had they placed any proper emphasis on the basic value of free expression in a democratic society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most depressing aspect about the predicament of free expression in the United Kingdom is not that for so many statements there is someone out there who wants to "ban" them but that there are so many officials and servants of the state - police officers, prosecutors, libel judges, district judges, ombudsmen - who will casually supercharge such illiberalism with the coercive force of law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the four quoted statements are particularly glamorous; but then they were not intended to be so.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the authors of the statements had any inkling of the legal consequences which would follow their utterance.  But like a sinister (but equally pathetic) version of Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition, someone somewhere was able to get the law to burst in and disrupt the lives of the statement's author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In each case the statement's author could have then taken the path of least resistance; indeed, I suspect dozens of people do so every day.  Simon Singh and Sally Bercow could have "apologised"; John Dixon could have shown "remorse"; Paul Chambers could have maintained a "guilty" plea.  And, in each case, no one would have really blamed them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is all so saddening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Cohen once said that you have to take your free speech cases as you find them and then get what victories you can.  Not every free expression issue means defending Galileo, DH Lawrence, or &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Lolita&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, none of the four quoted statements are, by themselves, of great interest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Personally, I have no interest in alternative medicine (apart from when its practioners misuse libel, hence I know about homeopaths and chiropractors, but nothing about acupuncturists and Reiki therapists); I do not think the beliefs of Scientologists any more or less credible than those of Christians or Muslims, though the practices and tactics of Scientologists are extremely worrying; the joke of Paul Chambers was ill-conceived; and I have no special interest in Migration Watch, though they are against my own general preference for unrestricted migration.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it is the statements' lack of interest which provides their significance; these are - or should be - everyday statements, uninhibited by legal threats and certainly free from legal consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it seems only by the slow and painstaking process of catching instances where the law is being used (or threatened) in an illiberal and misconceived way, and then working to reverse those instances, that the culture of "banning" speech acts can be challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be ideal to have, at a stroke, the United States' First Amendment guarantee of free speech introduced into the United Kingdom.  That is not, however, practical politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But our "banning" culture in respect of free expression is not inevitable and can be reversed; there is no good reason why the first reaction of so many people to unwelcome statements is to get the law involved, and then there is no good reason for so many police officers, judges, and officials to allow them to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the libel threat against Sally Bercow is, for me, another example of something which is horribly wrong in our political and legal culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is, for some, a controversial figure.  (And I am certainly not a fan of her political party and their complete disregard after 2001 for civil liberties.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sally Bercow could have just quietly apologised, perhaps with the pre-prepared humble apology which was attached to the threatening letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she chose not to do so.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has chosen instead to make a stand for her right as a political commentator to respond to news stories in the way she did.  She wants to show how threats like this to political commentators - and also journalists - support the need for &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/"&gt;libel reform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I think this is rather heroic, and so Robert Dougans (also instructed) and I are delighted to be able to assist her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-5004693309657975467?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286097437966"><id gr:original-id="http://thehistoryofpsychology.blogspot.com/2010/10/physiognomy-of-statesmen.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/127b1818897001ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Physiognomy of Statesmen</title><published>2010-10-03T04:13:56Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T04:13:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/GTBaq-9M38M/physiognomy-of-statesmen.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://thehistoryofpsychology.blogspot.com/2010/10/physiognomy-of-statesmen.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Physiognomy is a debunked pseudo-science which claimed to describe characterisics solely from the face. The Illusrated Annuals of Phrenology &amp;amp; Physiognomy (1866) define Physiognomy as the &amp;quot;science of external forms in their relation to internal organisation and character,&amp;quot;  In 1886, Samuel Wells edited a paper suggesting characteristics of statesmen at the time, and what characteristics a statesman would need in order to be an effective man of the people. Wells (1889) initially maintains that a statesman requires a large brain that is well supported by a healthy body. Additionally, other features should include a developed intellect enabling him to take a broad and comprehensive view of public questions, and to suggest measures as &amp;quot;may be necessary for the improvement of the people and the development of the country,&amp;quot;. Wells goes further, maintaing that a moral brain is also required to work for the good of the people. Evidently, a &amp;quot;mere pettifogger&amp;quot; who quarrels is unfit in Well&amp;#39;s eyes to be a good statesman. Wells then maintains that in both republics and monarchies, self ambition is too frequent, and there is a lack of truthfulness and consideration of the welfare of others. Wells argues such components of character should &amp;quot;animate these servants of state&amp;quot;.Metternich, a German-Austrian politician, was a noted diplomat and played a major role in Congress of Vienna. According to Wells, Metternich was a man of consummate intellect and great ambition. Wells also suggests he was clear, comprehensive and was at the forefront of European affairs. Additionally, he had &amp;quot;a handsome face, splended forehead, a full and expressive eye, a well-formed nose, a beautiful mouth, and a perfect chin,&amp;quot;.Wells maintains Talleyrand, a French diplomat, had a strong body, large brain, and strong perspective faculties. Critically, he had well developed Secretiveness, but poor Cautiousness. Wells admits that such features mean he lacks a broad and comprehensive mind - something Wells maintained was a critical feature of a great statesman. However, Wells maintains Destructiveness, Combativeness, Self-Esteem, and Firmness were among his largest organs.Wells then discusses De Witt Clinton, who he suggests was a projector. Wells asserts that his head was broad through Constructiveness, high in the center and in the crown, as well as full in the base. Apparently, his temperment was vital-motive and mental, the vital predominating.Jefferson, according to Wells, had an elevated brain, a conspicuous face and a well-formed body. Jefferson featured Firmness, Self-Esteem, Approbativeness, and Hope.Its interesting to see how Wells tries to give individuals he never met such deep characteristics on the basis of images. Unfortunately, it seems Wells was merely giving characteristics to individuals because of what they had done in the past. However, tt does seem that Self-Esteem and Firmness are found to be important Phrenological characteristics in an ideal statesman, and Wells does describe how a politician should be, a statement that seems poignant over 100 years later. It would seem then, that Physiognomy is dead. However, to some extent recent research has suggested that there is a relationship between facial characteristics and personaliyu. Highfield (2009) states that Physiognomy is undergoing a small revival. Specifically, Highfield argues that Little &amp;amp; Perrett found a link between facial appearance and the personality traits extroversion and conscientiousness. Additionally, Highfield goes further to state that Carré &amp;amp; McCormick found a correlation between among Ice Hockey players regarding specific facial features and aggressive behaviour Perhaps then, Physiognomy isn&amp;#39;t entirely dead, but rather, requires less pseudo-scientific methods.Highfield R, Wiseman R, &amp;amp; Jenkins R (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/about"&gt;The College has created The History of Vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to provide a living, changing chronicle of the compelling history of vaccination, from pre-Jennerian variolation practices, to the defeat of polio in the Western Hemisphere, to cutting-edge approaches to novel vaccines and vaccine delivery. The site aims to increase public knowledge and understanding of the ways in which vaccines, toxoids, and passive immunization work, how they have been developed, and the role they have played in the improvement of human health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The site will also discuss some of the controversies about vaccination and some of the challenges, difficulties, and tragic events that have occurred in the use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you will find at the History of Vaccines site:&lt;/p&gt;

And &lt;em&gt;grader&lt;/em&gt; in the sense  of "machine for leveling earth" is less salient than the sense of "someone who assigns grades", while what a road grader does to dirt could be thought of as &lt;em&gt;grating&lt;/em&gt; it,  by analogy to what cheese grater does to cheese.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286084292022"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d11a01dc70745cd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">New York Storm</title><published>2012-10-29T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2012-10-29T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/nystorm.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Photograph purportedly shows the Statue of Liberty amidst Hurricane Sandy.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286084204058"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29382">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b4c38da6302116c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The Controversial Non Sequitur Muhammad Comic Strip</title><published>2010-10-03T05:22:55Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T05:22:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/03/the-controversial-non-sequitur-muhammad-comic-strip/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;strong&gt;Wiley Miller&lt;/strong&gt;‘s &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/02/wheres-muhammad/"&gt;“controversial” &lt;em&gt;Non Sequitur&lt;/em&gt; comic strip&lt;/a&gt; which you may not be seeing in your local newspaper today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Rapper Shou Junchao , 24, has become a celebrity in Shanghai - people ask for his autograph and want him to pose for photos - after his performance on the hit television show China's Got Talent last month. His act captivated millions of fans, mostly young men, who liked his impromptu rap answers to the judges' questions. Men born after 1980 had mountainous burdens, he said, including mortgages and car loans, and he got a standing ovation when he said that if the luxury handbag you bought for your girlfriend was not as good as other girls' you would get a "bye-bye" from her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLIsZR0rd-U"&gt;TV show appearance&lt;/a&gt; is here, I think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;More from the SCMP article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Q: How many songs have you written?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;A: About seven. One of them is called Shanghainese are Excellent. I wrote it to defy a proposal last year for a ban on the Shanghai dialect. In my song I said the idea sounded like asking a monk not to have a bare head and not to burn incense every day. I also wrote: &amp;quot;Is it because Shanghai is so brilliant that you guys dislike everything about it? Shanghai is open to everyone. But it&amp;#39;s impossible to change its culture. You have so many negative impressions of Shanghainese, saying Shanghai men are stingy and Shanghai women are picky. You think all Shanghainese are rich, but actually many locals are poor. Shanghainese can&amp;#39;t afford the skyrocketing house prices in Shanghai. Shanghainese never look down on outsiders … We should speak Shanghai dialect. Shanghainese are excellent. If you don&amp;#39;t like Shanghai you can leave.&amp;quot; At the end I said, &amp;quot;I love Shanghai&amp;quot;, in English. I rapped in my dialect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to find a copy of "Shanghainese are Excellent" on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese linguistic diversity has negative aspects for Shou as well, it seems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Q: Are you in contact with rap fans in other cities?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;A: Yes, we chat on the internet. Rap is not so popular on the mainland and most people regard it as a musical form that is used to quarrel and say dirty words. The biggest difficulty constraining the spread of rap in mainland China is the fact that there are numerous dialects and people in one place can't understand a rap song sung in another dialect. I think highly of Hong Kong rapper Jin Au-yang, but I can't appreciate his songs because they are in Cantonese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a brain fart where I said “spermatheca” rather than “testis”, I think I did ok at trying to keep it non-technical!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try to cover some of the newer research on bedbugs over the next few months, since it’s a hot topic.  We talked about some of the new info about bedbug chemical signaling, but that didn’t make the cut into the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This, for me, was the most powerful scene in the 1984 film entitled "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Earth"&gt;Yellow Earth&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;em&gt;Huang Tudi&lt;/em&gt;), directed by Chen Kaige.  Most people who see the film don't even notice this scene, but it had an enormous impact on me that has lasted to this day, more than a quarter of a century after I first saw the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My discussion of the innate power of Hanzi prompted one of my students, Matt Anderson, to send me the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Here are some pictures I took in the mountains of far northern Viet Nam in 2008 and 2009 — I think they do a good job illustrating the cultural reach of Chinese characters even among those illiterate in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The first picture shows the wall of a makeshift dorm for elementary school students in Bắc Kạn province (the kids live too far away to walk to school each day).&lt;br&gt;

The kids who live there are mostly Hmong, and most of them can't speak Vietnamese, much less Chinese, but they've written some "Chinese characters" on the wall, as well as some Vietnamese, the English phrase "I love you", and a nice drawing of a bow which, coincidentally, looks a lot like the oracle bone graph for shè 射.   It's too bad there doesn't seem to be any Hmong on there, to add one more language.  Here's a closeup of the "Chinese".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson1a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson1a.jpg" width="400" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some of the characters could almost be real ones (I think I can make out zhōng 忠 [VHM:  maybe]), but they mostly seem invented.  The next picture shows some of the other dorms at this school, for context:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson2.jpg" width="400" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The next picture shows some carved graffiti on the side of a school in Hà Giang province.  There are some real characters here, but I can't resolve them into anything that makes any sense (except perhaps dàifu ["doctor"] or dàfū ["senior official"] 大夫, if read from right to left). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson3.jpg" width="400" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; The last photograph is of the school where this one was taken. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/MattAnderson4.jpg" width="400" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most of the kids at this school were also Hmong — very few of them were really able to speak Vietnamese (though, of course, that&amp;#39;s their language of instruction).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The kids at both of these schools have probably never even been to their local district towns, much less the nearest city, so they&amp;#39;ve probably never seen any Chinese signs.  I&amp;#39;m not sure where they got the inspiration to write Chinese — perhaps the labels on products made in China?  From Chinese movies on tv?  From some sort of tradition?  (I visited the &amp;quot;castle&amp;quot; of an early 20th century Hmong &amp;quot;king&amp;quot;, also in Hà Giang province, not too far away from this school, which was as covered in Chinese characters as any structure you could find in China — I don&amp;#39;t know if this survives as an ideal among the Hmong or something — these kids certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t have had the chance to visit that building, though.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286068891525"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/dos_and_donts_debating_creatio.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/afbd00c9259b213b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Do's and Don'ts Debating Creationists: Part 1</title><published>2010-10-03T02:12:46Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T02:12:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/6ddMGIdlWCs/dos_and_donts_debating_creatio.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/dos_and_donts_debating_creatio.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ppMU081Ge9Y?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/dos_and_donts_debating_creatio.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/6ddMGIdlWCs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286068686299"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29333">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0871b35f79575e6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Where’s Muhammad?</title><published>2010-10-03T01:00:47Z</published><updated>2010-10-03T01:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/02/wheres-muhammad/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Take note of &lt;strong&gt;Wiley Miller&lt;/strong&gt;‘s comic strip &lt;em&gt;Non Sequitur&lt;/em&gt; in your newspaper this weekend if it regularly appears there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several newspapers are rejecting this Sunday’s strip in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2010/09/28/papers-pulling-non-sequitur-because-of-muhammad-mention/"&gt;What’s so offensive&lt;/a&gt; about it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[It] depicts a lazy, sunny park scene with the caption, &lt;strong&gt;“Picture book title voted least likely to ever find a publisher… ‘Where’s Muhammad?’”&lt;/strong&gt; Characters in the park are buying ice cream, fishing, roller skating, etc. No character is depicted as even Middle Eastern.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s where we’re at now.  Some papers are scared shitless because someone is simply &lt;em&gt;implying the existence of&lt;/em&gt; a drawing of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller was equally disturbed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“[T]he irony of editors being afraid to run even such a tame cartoon as this that satirizes the blinding fear in media regarding anything surrounding Islam sadly speaks for itself. Indeed, the terrorists have won.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have, haven’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the comic shows up on his &lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/"&gt;syndicate’s website&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, please post it wherever you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not good enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needs to be publicly acknowledged and recognized that Mark Schneider committed a hate crime.  This is not the worst hate crime anyone ever committed ... no one was hurt or killed, just terrorized. It needs to be publicly noted that if an openly gay man bumped into a 14 year old Boy Scout holding an American Flag and told that he should not be a member of that organization because it is anti-gay, that he would likely be physically abused and arrested.  In other words, there is a well known and obvious asymmetry working here.  It needs to be further acknowledged that Mark Schneider is considered, in La Crosse, to be a pillar of the local society and a respectable person, which makes us wonder about the morals, ethics, and values of the people of La Crosse and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/about.php#YourState"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; more generally.  Furthermore, it needs to be publicly stated, so we can check in on this later, that Mark Schneider needs to be removed from his position as Commodore (which is a pretty dumb-ass thing to begin with) and not called upon by the people of La Cross for further Pillar-Of-Society work should any arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I say this to the homophobic citizens of La Cross:  Even if you agree with your buddy Mark, and you think the flag should not get all rainbow-ey and shit, and you hate fags, and want them to go to another country like Mark wants, consider this:  The man took it out on a 14 year old girl. &lt;em&gt;He took his political fight to a little kid. &lt;/em&gt; If you do not think he is fucked for having done this, then you exist at the same very, very low level at which he exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Schneider of La Cross Wisconsin.  One of the world's great assholes.  And so it shall ever be recorded on the Internet for all to see and remember forever.  &lt;/p&gt;

Less well-known is the effect we can have on the speed of evolution.  Human-driven environmental pressures can force species to adapt at speeds rarely seen in the past.   For instance, the extreme scale and intensity of fishing in the past fifty years has caused rapid evolution in fish.  When we catch and eat all the big fish in in a population, we make it evolutionarily advantageous for fish to lay eggs when they are younger and smaller.  During the collapse of the North Atlantic cod fishery in the late &amp;#39;80s and early &amp;#39;90s, it took just a decade for the average of maturity to drop from six years to five. 

This cod story is documented in a 2004 paper by Olsen et. al. in Nature.  While the phenomenon had been observed before, their team used a novel technique to tease the evolutionary signal out from other trends in the cod population.   More interesting to me, though, is that they were able to detect the change using old data not originally collected for this purpose.  They found that the accelerating pace of evolution was evident as far back as 1985, just as the collapse of the cod fishery was getting underway.

This suggests that one might be able to monitor species for evolutionary changes as a warning of extreme environmental pressures.   The authors themselves warn that evolutionary changes should not be misinterpreted as signs of imminent collapse, but surely when human impacts become the driving factor behind evolution, something is amiss.  We may be able to catch ourselves before we permanently alter a population for the worse.

&lt;p&gt;You can guess one winner for each category. It’s possible that two or more people will share the Medicine/Physiology prize, and if you prefer you can guess more than one. If you do this, however, you won’t win u&lt;em&gt;nless everyone in the set shares the prize&lt;/em&gt;. (This keeps people from entering a long list of names in hopes that one will hit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each winner gets a personally autographed copy of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;.  The first guesser in each category gets the prize. In the unlikely event that someone guesses both winners correctly, a book will also go to the next correct guesser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contest closes for Medicine/Physiology at 9:00 a.m. GMT, Monday, Oct. 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contest closes for Literature at 12:30 p.m. GMT, Thursday, Oct. 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be a bit knowledgable (though this isn’t required): briefly state what work you think the prize will be awarded for (in Medicine/Physiology) or one or two of the works that support the Literature prize. Doing this for literature will point us to things worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't care if you have office hours.  It doesn't respect 9 am meetings.  Sometimes I think it likes to make you do the late walk of shame to your office, where you will inevitably find a gaggle of students seated on the linoleum, anxious because you are 10 minutes late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday night I got home and found a weird round spot on my dog Zeek's ass.  In fact, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drisis/status/25829894419"&gt;I tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, "I suspect my dog has ringworm of the ass."  Mr. Isis took the dog to the vet while I stayed home with Little Isis.  Mr. Isis then returned with a pathetic looking, shaved ass dog, who smelled like my Uncle Frankie's Old Spice and was sporting the cone of shame&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/cone%20of%20jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="cone of jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/10/cone%20of%20jpg-thumb-300x225-56516.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__Z0UJcDstVY/SNd6not7MiI/AAAAAAAAA5k/FH_-m5W5GEI/s400/IMG_0806.JPG"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;:  The cone of shame.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, this is where the excitement of the subsequent 12 hours begins.  With a dog, his shaved ass, and the cone of shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Isis returned home with a diagnosis of fleas for Zeek the Dog.  Upon hearing this, I banished Zeek to the basement for the night, until we could be sure that he was no longer &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/qa.htm"&gt;potentially carrying the plague&lt;/a&gt;.   I changed the sheets on our bed and settled in.   Several hours later I was sleeping, dreaming that I was laying on a warm, white sand beach.  The tide had just come in, covering me in the warm, salty sea, when I vaguely heard Mr. Isis yelling, &amp;quot;Isis!  Get up!  I think Zeek is peeing in the bed!!&amp;quot;  Sure enough, I sat up to find Zeek the Dog, inches from my face, relieving himself on my person.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="laying in shallows copy.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/laying%20in%20shallows%20copy.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Dr. Isis's dream beach vacation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked me in the eye the entire time he did it, making sure I knew that it was his urine I was being doused with.  Then he calmly turned around and left.  Just left. Exactly like that time in college.  I said to Mr. Isis, &amp;quot;Get your stuff.  I can&amp;#39;t be up again all night.  We&amp;#39;ll go to the guest room.&amp;quot;   Mr. Isis replied, &amp;quot;But, it&amp;#39;s already 7 am.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This left me two choices.  I could hop in the shower, drop Little Isis at school, and rush to work, or I could send Little Isis with Mr. Isis, clean up my bedroom, shower, and get dressed like a civilized human being.  I chose option two.  Leaving my bed urine-soaked to return home to after a day of science shenanigans seems to have been a line for me - a line I was not willing to cross.  I went to work an hour late and did not come home to cold urine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday there is something.  Something unexpected that knocks you off schedule, or throws you off your game.  I&amp;#39;ve gone through periods where I&amp;#39;ve treated my career like some twisted game of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole"&gt;Whac-A-Mole&lt;/a&gt;.  But, I&amp;#39;ve learned that no matter how quickly I whack the moles, they still keep coming.  There will always be more moles to whack and some moles will always go unwhacked at the end of the day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok to not feel guilty because you missed whacking a few moles in order to clean the urine out of your bed.  It&amp;#39;s even more ok to then go pee in the dog&amp;#39;s bed.  That jerk had it coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/10/to_be_a_good_scientist_you_don.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/IyKKtYDfuMk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286055096127"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2678">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/156e45832ca8f9d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">The rɑɪt sɑʊnz?</title><published>2010-10-02T21:02:52Z</published><updated>2010-10-02T21:02:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2678" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Baa1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="8776"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bid1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="5850"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bead1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="10030"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Buy1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="14209"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bide1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="10448"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bight1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="8358"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Angus Grieve-Smith writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was always taught that the most straightforward way to write American diphthongs is [aj] and [aw], and the "long" mid vowels as [e] and [o]. Recently I've been seeing [ɑɪ ɑʊ ɛɪ] and [ɔʊ] popping up.  This seems to reflect at least three different changes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;(1) A shift from using [j w ɰ] to represent glides, to representing diphthongs as a series of vowel sounds.&lt;br&gt;
(2) A shift to greater detail in these representations.&lt;br&gt;
(3) A shift in the standard from somewhere close to my dialect (Hudson Valley) to … someplace else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angus&amp;#39;s point (1) is well taken, and closely related to his point (2).  &amp;quot;Rising&amp;quot; diphthongs in English — those that go from a more open mouth position to a more closed one, and therefore end &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; than they began — aren&amp;#39;t generally distinguished from one another in how high they go.  There&amp;#39;s a distinction between the ones where the tongue goes to the front of the mouth (e.g. the vowels in standard American pronunciations of &lt;em&gt;boy, buy, bey&lt;/em&gt;) and those where the tongue goes towards the back of the mouth (e.g. the vowels in standard American &lt;em&gt;bough, [rain]bow&lt;/em&gt;).  But you don't generally see words distinguished (in a given variety of English) between degrees of height in the off-glide.  And across dialects, there's indeed a lot of variety in the detailed trajectories of these vowels. Also,  all of these are clearly on the vowel+glide side of the fence rather than vowel+vowel side. So why not stick with the IPA's palatal approximant /j/ and its labio-velar approximant /w/ (i.e. the consonant-side versions of the vowels /i/ and /u/), and let the phonetic details take care of themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that there are two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;(a) Angus&amp;#39;s point (3) is misleading — he doesn&amp;#39;t really pronounce words like &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; the way he thinks he does.&lt;br&gt;
(b) The IPA's choice of 'j' to represent a palatal approximant (= high front glide) is problematic for Anglophones, for whom 'j' is strongly identified as the voiced palatal affricate in &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;jerk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point (a) first. (And I'll limit the discussion here to just one of the cases that he brings up.)  I don't think I've ever heard an American speaker who really has the glide version of IPA [i] at the end of words like &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt;.  You can work out what that would be like by saying &lt;em&gt;bee&lt;/em&gt; to yourself, and then saying &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; so that it ends with the same sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans stop in lots of (vowel-space) places when they say a word like &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt;, ranging from Southerners who have a simple monophthong that barely budges from its low back nucleus ("bah"), to others who take it forward to (the low front vowel of) &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; but not really up much at all, to those who go forward and then up to (the vowel of) &lt;em&gt;bed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bid&lt;/em&gt;.  But nobody goes all the way to (the high front vowel of) &lt;em&gt;bead&lt;/em&gt;.  (The vowel nucleus also varies, but never mind that for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the pronunciations of &lt;em&gt;baa, bid, bead&lt;/em&gt; from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;baa&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've plotted them on a standard -F2 / -F1 formant plot, in which vowel height runs bottom-to-top on the y axis, and the front/back dimension runs left-to-right on the x axis. In order to reduce each of these to a single value (plotted at the center of each text string), I've taken the point (near the center of the syllable) where F1 is maximum.  I've added &lt;em&gt;ooh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bee&lt;/em&gt; as additional points of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agasint this background, I've plotted the whole diphthongal trajectory of the M-W pronunciation of &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/VowelQ2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that it peters out quite a bit short of the vowel of &lt;em&gt;bee&lt;/em&gt; — and even a bit short of &lt;em&gt;bid&lt;/em&gt;.  Here's the trajectory of &lt;em&gt;bide&lt;/em&gt;, from (I think) the same speaker, which does get close to &lt;em&gt;bid&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/VowelQ4.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one little wrinkle here. Many American speakers — including this guy on the MW site — have raising and fronting of this vowel-class before voiceless consonants. Thus &lt;em&gt;bite&lt;/em&gt; (OK, really &lt;em&gt;bight&lt;/em&gt; — MW has &lt;em&gt;bite&lt;/em&gt; read by a female speaker, whose vowel space would be confusingly different):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/VowelQ3.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the nucleus is a bit higher, and the glide in this case goes all the way to &lt;em&gt;bee&lt;/em&gt;, even though the vowel as a whole is quite a bit shorter.  (See "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001996.html"&gt;Raising and lowering those tighty whities&lt;/a&gt;", 3/20/2005, and "&lt;a href="http://quote.ucsd.edu/blogs/phonoloblog/2004/08/25/trajectory-of-long-i/"&gt;Trajectory of 'long i'&lt;/a&gt;", phonoloblog, 8/25/2004, for some further discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how Angus talks, but my guess is that his &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bide&lt;/em&gt; are pretty much like this speaker's are, and his &lt;em&gt;bite&lt;/em&gt; will either be raised and fronted (like the example above) or will be closer to the trajectory of his &lt;em&gt;bide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum up: IPA [ɪ] as in bid is a reasonable approximation to the offglide in words like &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bide&lt;/em&gt;. But given the variation across dialects and contexts in the extent of the offglide, why not just call it (some implementation of) /j/, as Angus would prefer? Why the [ɪ]-ward movement that he notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;When it was just on &lt;a href="http://dictionary.com"&gt;dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; (credited to Random House and Collins) I thought it was just one editor's quirk, but it's in the ESL text I'm using this semester (Grant 2010), and now in the new edition of Yule's Study of Language (2010), and Language Files (2007).  What gives?  Does anyone know what's going on?  Did this happen gradually by people copying each other, was it argued for in a paper, or was it decided by some LSA committee that I never heard about?  Is that level of detail really necessary in dictionaries, ESL texts and introductory linguistics books, and how do we know that it is?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that /j/ is just too annoying/confusing for Anglophones, who are already traditionally resistant to IPA in dictionary and other non-specialist publications.  The fact that [j] is wrong as a matter of phonetic detail (if you think of it as a glide equivalent to [i]) offers an excuse to avoid this obnoxious feature of the IPA. That's certainly how I feel about it.  But perhaps we'll hear from some people who know something about the editorial policies of the sources that Angus cites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Angus also made some interesting observations about the treatment of both the nucleus and the off-glide in the vowels of words like bough and [rain]bow, but I'll leave that for another time.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286054060832"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29367">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4874bdc60199613</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Bill Maher Debates the Bible with Bill O’Reilly</title><published>2010-10-02T21:00:05Z</published><updated>2010-10-02T21:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/10/02/bill-maher-debates-the-bible-with-bill-oreilly/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you know you’re an atheist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You watch &lt;strong&gt;Bill O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt;‘s interview with &lt;strong&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/strong&gt; and realize there’s nothing here you haven’t heard 3208423 times before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my reactions mirrored Maher’s the whole way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really? That’s the argument you’re going with? It’s so overused… It’s not even worth my time to give you a more nuanced answer, so I’ll give you a clichéd response right back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/AS14_crew.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/AS14_crew-thumb-500x379-56480.jpeg" width="500" height="379" alt="AS14_crew.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Stuart Roosa (left) and Edgar Mitchel (right), commander Alan Shepard (center) became the first man to &lt;i&gt;golf&lt;/i&gt; on another planet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/she0-021.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/she0-021-thumb-500x371-56482.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="she0-021.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His famous quote, after hitting the ball squarely, was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Miles and miles and miles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But take a look at the video itself.  It sure doesn't seem like that ball would've gone miles and miles and miles at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zCOOgRxqzmw?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=315" width="500" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is hitting a golf ball for miles on the Moon really possible?  Let's look at this in a little detail.  On Earth, a very good golfer can hit a ball about 300 yards, with very few notable exceptions getting a little farther.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Home%20SS%20Golf%20Ball%20at%20Impact%204wRR.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Home%20SS%20Golf%20Ball%20at%20Impact%204wRR-thumb-500x400-56484.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="Home SS Golf Ball at Impact 4wRR.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Moon's a little different.  With no atmosphere (and no air resistance), and only &lt;i&gt;one-sixth&lt;/i&gt; of the Earth's gravity, we can figure out -- with a little help from physics -- how far it would be possible to hit a golf ball on the Moon!  We need to know two things to figure it out: how fast the ball can move and what angle to hit the ball at.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the fastest initial speed a golf ball can have?  Well, you can measure the speed of a golf club without too much problem.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Golf%20Swing.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Golf%20Swing-thumb-500x468-56507.jpeg" width="500" height="468" alt="Golf Swing.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a typical amateur golfer can swing a club at 90 miles per hour (40 m/s).  Does that mean the ball goes off at that speed?  Hardly.  You can make the ball go &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; that speed!  How?  Just make sure you've got a club head that's much more massive than the ball, and that you've got an elastic collision, and you're in business!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aIrLF6OPzls?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's say you can give the ball an initial speed of 180 miles per hour (80 m/s) on the Moon.  What angle would you hit it at?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Trackman%20flight%20slice.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Trackman%20flight%20slice-thumb-500x255-56509.jpeg" width="500" height="255" alt="Trackman flight slice.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very different from Earth, where you hit the ball at a relatively low angle and rely on aerodynamics to minimize wind resistance and maximize the distance.  On the Moon, you've simply got to launch it at 45 degrees, and that's the farthest it can go on the fly!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you want it to go on the fly, because the surface of the Moon is like one giant sand trap.  So how far is that?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Moon_Golf-470x364.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/Moon_Golf-470x364-thumb-500x387-56511.jpeg" width="500" height="387" alt="Moon_Golf-470x364.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;b&gt;two and a half miles&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;3948 meters&lt;/b&gt;!  Not only that, but it would take &lt;b&gt;more than a minute&lt;/b&gt; (69.8 seconds) for the ball to come back down!  In fact, it's totally conceivable that Alan Shepard's one-armed, 6-iron shot on the Moon holds the record for the farthest golf shot in the history of humanity!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So surprisingly, the answer is &lt;b&gt;yes&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;miles and miles and miles&lt;/i&gt; is totally realistic for a golf shot on the Moon!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/apollo17-moon-surface-photo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba/apollo17-moon-surface-photo-thumb-500x376-56513.jpeg" width="500" height="376" alt="apollo17-moon-surface-photo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if only there were some good way to find that ball in the great sand trap that is the Moon's surface... &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/10/could_you_really_hit_a_golf_ba.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286041559071"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6325040547240517466">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d749bf9ba20eeb49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Friends in Montreal</title><published>2010-10-02T17:40:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-02T17:40:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/10/friends-in-montreal.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;Seanna Watson, Steve Watson, Sue Strandberg, and a photo bomber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKdvBmJbxjI/AAAAAAAAKx4/ELpEtXsnJsI/s1600/Seanna_Steve_Sue_PZ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKdvBmJbxjI/AAAAAAAAKx4/ELpEtXsnJsI/s400/Seanna_Steve_Sue_PZ.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This photo is from last night after dinner.

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Kurtz, there were two areas of conflict. First, he says, Mr. Lindsay changed the work culture. Whereas Mr. Kurtz had managed “in the spirit of a think tank,” Mr. Lindsay brought his legal background to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am used to the academic life, where we don’t impose rules on employees,” Mr. Kurtz said, sitting in his living room. But Mr. Lindsay, he said, “set up a command system, said these are the rules and laws, and anyone who deviates from that will be investigated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees were interrogated for minor infractions, Mr. Kurtz said, and several were let go. “That is like Stalinism or the Inquisition,” Mr. Kurtz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By phone and by e-mail, Mr. Lindsay said that the “investigations” were due-process inquiries into complaints, and that he had not fired anyone for questioning his authority. He said that four employees were laid off for economic reasons, one resigned, and one freelance employee did not have his contract renewed. Only the center’s spokesman, Nathan Bupp, who left last week, may have been fired; Mr. Lindsay, in an e-mail, would only say, “This was not a layoff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, he said that Mr. Kurtz, after 30 years of leadership, simply found it too difficult to cede responsibility; in particular, Mr. Lindsay mentioned fund-raising, saying that Mr. Kurtz was reluctant to introduce him to donors he had known for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you CfI followers probably know this stuff.  The piece also describes other juicy shenanigans, like Ronald Lindsay recently changing the locks at the Amherst CfI center so that Kurtz couldn’t get in.  Of more interest to me is Kurtz’s assertion that he left CfI because of its infusion of “angry atheism.”  Could that accusation explain why CfI has recently been so vociferous in its attacks on the Gnu Atheists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations to CfI have also fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially now I’ve got the hang of uploading via Dropbox – and yes, that &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a tremendous sigh of relief you can hear, because I have so much to broadcast and I’m dying to have you listen to it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First – tech issues solved and you can hear:&lt;a title="Permanent link to Episode Thirty-Five – On Science At Home – An Interview With Deb Hodgkin" rel="bookmark" href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/08/23/episode-thirty-five-on-science-at-home-an-interview-with-deb-hodgkin/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then – a mission I’ve had in mind for a while about improving audio quality on earlier eps, starting with this one:&lt;a title="Permanent link to Re-Release of Ayaan Hirsi Ali Interview – Episode Thirty-Two" rel="bookmark" href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/10/01/re-release-of-ayaan-hirsi-ali-interview-episode-thirty-two/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then – the latest and absolutely a must-listen (one of several I want to transcribe so you can read it as well as listen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct link to the mp3 of &lt;a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_36_-_On_Skeptical_Activism_And_Creationism__An_Interview_With_Jayson_Cooke_Of_Griffith_University_Skeptics_And_Freethinkers.mp3"&gt;Episode #36 – On Skeptical Activism And Creationism – An Interview With Jayson Cooke Of Griffith University Skeptics And Freethinkers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, download, send feedback – there’s also a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://australasianskeptics.info/viewforum.php?f=39"&gt;Token Skeptic Forum Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; over at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://australasianskeptics.info/viewforum.php?f=39"&gt;Australasian Skeptics Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that they have kindly set up, so if you’re not the emailing-kind or reviewing-kind, I’ll respond to you there with every episode. It’s a brand-new site and so I encourage you to check it out and network. Speaking of which -&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Token-Skeptic/251243190557?ref=ts"&gt;Facebook Page For Token Skeptic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks and let me know about the show – and reviews on iTunes that are positive and supportive are ALWAYS welcomed! By the way, I have some wonderful news about merchandise to announce soon too, so watch out for that…&lt;/p&gt;

This finding, recently reported in PLoS genetics, does not surprise us but is nonetheless important.  This important in two ways:  1) This study uncovers numerical details of human genetic variation that are necessary to understand change across populations and over time; and 2) the variation across populations are interesting and, in fact, seem to conform to expectations (in a "we don't' really care about statistical significance" sort of way, for now) regarding human social organization.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;~ A repost ... because effective polygyny is still interesting ~ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before examining the paper, we should mention four terms/concepts:  Effective population size, Polygyny, and Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), and Variation in Reproductive Success (RS).  The first two are used in the article, and the third I'm adding because it is a good one to know.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/effective_polygyny_in_humans_t_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/effective_polygyny_in_humans_t_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/Da_X4kyZ7hI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1286030178722"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=5478">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c677a4fd626841b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Politics"/><category term="Science and Society"/><title type="html">Science is Vital</title><published>2010-10-02T12:54:59Z</published><updated>2010-10-02T12:54:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/TzaLuVBPRbc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/10/02/science-is-vital/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although I live and work in the US, I was born and educated up to graduate school in the UK, and for reasons both intellectual and personal have been becoming increasingly appalled by the treatment of science there. Put simply, after years of neglect and pressure under the previous Labour government, science funding is now facing &lt;a href="http://exquisitelife.researchresearch.com/exquisite_life/2010/09/the-effects-of-cutting-qr-in-england-by-15-per-cent.html"&gt;evisceration&lt;/a&gt; under the new ruling Conservative/Lib-Dem coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lengthy post in the works about my own feelings about the state of the British higher education system, and the treatment of science more specifically. However, here I’d like to make sure that any interested readers are aware of a concerted effort to push back against the planned short-sighted cuts, under the banner of the &lt;a href="http://scienceisvital.org.uk/"&gt;Science is Vital&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their website, Science is Vital is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… a group of concerned scientists, engineers and supporters of science who are campaigning to prevent destructive levels of cuts to science funding in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the concrete steps that one can take to help the cause (mostly useful if you live in Britain) are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. Sign the Campaign for Science &amp;amp; Engineering petition.&lt;br&gt;
2. Join the Science is Vital demo in central London, Saturday 9th October at 2 PM.&lt;br&gt;
3. Write to your MP about the importance of science, technology, engineering and maths.&lt;br&gt;
4. Come to the Houses of Parliament for the Science is Vital lobby of MPs on 12th October, 3.30 to 4.30 PM.&lt;br&gt;
5. Spread the word using the posters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow cosmological bloggers &lt;a href="http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/ajaffe/home"&gt;Andrew Jaffe&lt;/a&gt; (an American who lives and works in the UK, as a Professor at Imperial College, and blogs at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.andrewjaffe.net/blog/"&gt;Leaves on the Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/?page=full&amp;amp;id=86"&gt;Peter Coles&lt;/a&gt; (a Professor at Cardiff University who blogs at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/"&gt;In the Dark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) have been writing eloquently and persuasively about the threat to British science for quite some time now. Both have recent posts (&lt;a href="http://www.andrewjaffe.net/blog/science/000478.html"&gt;Jaffe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/game-over-for-science-not-yet-i-hope/"&gt;Coles&lt;/a&gt;) which describe the Science is Vital effort and the motivations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care about science, and maintaining Britain’s historical strength in this area, I urge you to &lt;a href="http://scienceisvital.org.uk/sign-the-petition/"&gt;sign the Science is Vital petition&lt;/a&gt;, and do whatever you can to fight the planned cuts. It can take a long time to become one of the world’s leading nations in such an important endeavor, but considerably less time to throw away that status. Please don’t let that happen to British science.&lt;/p&gt;

I've made my arguments. Let them talk among themselves about it. The test is straightforward, simple and elegant. It's all about not having any double standards when critically evaluating religious faiths. In the end, the OTF disallows faith when examining the reasons to accept or re-evaluate a religion. For having faith in one's own culturally inherited religion unfairly exempts that religion from an objective evaluation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What this means is that when examining Christianity a person who is already a Christian cannot punt to faith when encountering problems, since doing this is disallowed by the OTF. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In fact, to the degree a person must repeatedly do this is the degree his or her religious sect is false.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; One cannot have his thumb of faith on the weighing scales. One is left with reason and evidence. No more using the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/07/omniscience-escape-clause.html"&gt;omniscience escape clause&lt;/a&gt; either. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christians must seek to justify what they consider the facts apart from faith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My contention is that Christians cannot do this. My contention is that this is NOT any fault with the OTF itself since it is a reasonable, objective and fair test. The fact is that Christianity MUST pass the OTF. Otherwise, people who could not be convinced to believe because they were raised as outsiders will be thrown into hell. If Christianity does not pass the OTF God is to be blamed when outsiders cannot be convinced to believe. So there can be no legitimate objection to the OTF. Q.E.D.

&lt;p&gt;That’s a mama tiger and her cub at the Denver zoo. My family went there recently (without me; I was under a deadline for an article and was leaving the next day for North Dakota) and had a great time. I went with my wife and daughter last year, and it’s a really nice zoo. One of the better underrated ones. &lt;/p&gt;

In his piece (which is not yet online), titled “Can You Hear Me Now? Physics shows that cell phones cannot cause cancer,” Shermer argues that it is “virtually impossible” for cell phones to cause cancer because they “do not emit enough energy to break the molecular bonds inside cells.” While this latter statement may be true—the radiation that cell phones emit is not thought to be energetic enough to directly break DNA molecules—it is not fair (or scientific, for that matter) to use this as proof that cell phones do not cause cancer. The issue is far more complex than that.

Biologists once assumed that mutations were responsible for most diseases; now we know that more subtle genetic (and epigenetic) variations play an even bigger role. Many scientists also once thought that “junk DNA” didn’t have a function, but now research is pouring in suggesting that, in fact, non-coding DNA is responsible for many aspects of gene regulation; some RNA molecules once dismissed as garbage might even run the entire show. Genetics isn’t simple, my friends—and neither is cancer, for that matter. Despite decades upon decades of research, scientists still don’t know all of the ways in which cancer can be sparked. So to announce to the world—in an authoritative magazine like Scientific American, no less—that something definitely does not cause cancer simply because it cannot break DNA seems like a really irresponsible thing to do.

You’re probably wondering: how might cell phones cause cancer, then? Cancer develops when the cell cycle goes awry and cells start to multiply when they should not. Considering that thousands of genes are thought to be involved in the cell cycle—and an as yet unknown number of non-protein-coding sequences might regulate them—there are plenty of potential factors to consider. Cell cycle genes can be disrupted because of a mutation or a DNA break, sure, but problems could also arise when, say, something causes a tumor-suppressor gene like p53 (which protects against cancer) to be downregulated, perhaps from a post-translational modification or a change to chromatin structure. Or maybe something in the environment ramps up the expression of a growth-promoting gene, causing a cell to abnormally proliferate. Environmental influences could also disrupt the DNA repair machinery, as this would allow DNA breaks that arose as a result of some other process to go unfixed. If cell phones did any one of these things, they could easily increase cancer risk—but there are all possibilities that Shermer ignores when he concludes at the end of his column that “it is impossible for cell phones to hurt the brain.” For him, it seems, there is only one route to cancer—direct DNA breaks—but that’s simply not true.

So is there any evidence that cell phones can do the things I just mentioned? Actually, yes. A handful of studies, including one published in 2005 in Environmental Health Perspectives and another published in Bioelectromagetics, report that cell phone radiation affects chromatin conformation, which directly impacts gene expression and could, therefore, affect the cell cycle. These studies also found that cells exposed to cell phone radiation produce less of a protein complex called 53BP1 believed to be involved in DNA repair. In addition, research published by University of Washington researchers in the 1990s found that cell phone radiation elicited DNA breaks in rat brain cells (something Shermer doesn’t address in his piece, though it directly contradicts his assertion); the authors speculated that the radiation was probably interrupting the DNA repair process. (As an aside: I interviewed one of these researchers, Henry Lai, for my 2008 article about cell phones in Canada’s The Walrus magazine; after he published this study, a scientific advisory group created by the organization that represents the wireless industry sent a letter to the president of the University of Washington demanding that he and his co-author both be fired. They were not.)

It’s a big step to conclude from these studies that cell phones cause cancer, of course, and I’m not about to do that. I’m also not going to delve into the mess of epidemiological data on the topic, but if you’re curious, you can read more about some of it in my Walrus piece and a related article I wrote for Scientific American in 2008. My point here is not that cell phones are deadly, but rather that in his column, Shermer does a disservice to his readers by unfairly concluding that cell phones must be safe because they do not directly cause DNA breaks. Science—especially biology—is rarely that cut and dried.

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Greaney"&gt;well known&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;embiggen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; was coined by Dan Greaney for an episode of &lt;i&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_the_Iconoclast"&gt;Wikipedia reports&lt;/a&gt; that it "has seen use in several scientific publications" already.  I wonder if it might really be taking off as a mainstream item of vocabulary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might put Dan Greaney into the very select club of people who invented words that make it into major dictionaries.  A club containing him and very few others, such as the fellow &lt;i&gt;Simpsons&lt;/i&gt; writer David S. Cohen ([now known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_X._Cohen#Name_change"&gt;David X. Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, as commenters below point out] who &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromulent#Embiggen_and_cromulent"&gt;coined &lt;i&gt;cromulent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;i&gt;Simpsons&lt;/i&gt; episode), Robert Heinlein (who coined &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok"&gt;&lt;i&gt;grok&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Stranger in a Strange Land&lt;/i&gt;), and (I blush modestly to confess) also me.  I coined the term &lt;i&gt;eggcorn&lt;/i&gt;, which has &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2633"&gt;made it to the &lt;i&gt;OED&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two words that are likely to make it in the future: the widely used linguistic technical term &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccusative"&gt;&lt;i&gt;unaccusative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and  the scientific term &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003784.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;vortensity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (designed to order for some Santa Cruz astronomers, and introduced in J.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Denver Post&lt;/em&gt;‘s &lt;strong&gt;Electa Draper&lt;/strong&gt; wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_16200435"&gt;excellent article about the event&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s not enough that a national survey released Tuesday found atheists were the highest-scoring group on basic religious knowledge — now members of Metro State Atheists are being regular goody-two-shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group began a three-day campus food drive Tuesday dubbed “Food for Freethought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other atheist groups have held “fiction for fiction” drives, in which they collect Bibles and hand over novels in exchange. But that struck Guttormson, 24, as disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d much rather try to change our image by giving food to the homeless,” Guttormson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guttormson said he gets hate mail every time his group does a public event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re feeding the hungry,” he tells his critics. “What more can we do besides converting that can make you stop hating me?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Joel just doesn’t get it. He’s feeding the hungry with &lt;em&gt;atheist-tainted food&lt;/em&gt;.  Everyone knows homeless people don’t want that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metro State group is doing a wonderful service here and I hope it’s replicated in other places &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott says that with concern for the environment growing and the influence of mainstream faiths waning, druidry is flourishing more now than at any time since the arrival of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Druidry’s followers are not restricted to one god or creator, but worship the spirit they believe inhabits the earth and forces of nature such as thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druids also worship the spirits of places, such as mountains and rivers, with rituals focused particularly on the turning of the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-year inquiry, the Charity Commission decided that druidry offered coherent practices for the worship of a supreme being, and provided a beneficial moral framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since (according to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) the druid religion has a long history, antedating Christianity, and since by its own lights the Druid Network &lt;a href="http://druidnetwork.org/beliefs/faqs#religion"&gt;is largely &lt;em&gt;polytheistic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recognized religions clearly have a new and serious competitor.  It will be fun to see Christians like Karl Giberson explain why they’re so sure that there’s only one god—the Christian one—and not a bunch of supernatural spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

According to an international team of researchers, a close examination of feathers from a recently unearthed giant penguin fossil revealed that it was clad in reddish-brown and grey, instead of the familiar black-and-white colors worn by its modern relatives. Additionally, the researchers found differences in feather structure between ancient and extant penguins; differences that may offer clues for how modern penguin feathers evolved. The 36 million-year-old penguin fossil was discovered by a Peruvian undergraduate student, Ali Altamirano, on an expedition in Yumaque Point in the Paracas Reserve of Peru. The new species was dubbed Inkayacu paracasensis (EEN-kah-YAH-koo  par-ah-kah-sin-sis) - from the local Native American language, Quechua, &amp;quot;Inka&amp;quot; for emperor and &amp;quot;yacu&amp;quot; for water; and the species name is paracasensis in honour of the Reserva Nacional de Paracas, where the specimen was found. Based on measurements of the nearly complete skeleton (recovered bones are coloured white in Figure 1, below), Inkayacu&amp;#39;s body length is almost 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall, making it one of the largest penguins to have ever lived - twice as big as the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri, the largest living penguin species. But like modern penguins, it hunted by diving for fish, as we can see from Inkayacu&amp;#39;s long, grooved beak.The specimen was recognised early on as being special because, unlike any other penguin fossils previously uncovered, this one was accompanied by imprints from surrounding soft tissues. When the team noticed the scaly soft tissue preserved on an exposed foot, Inkayacu earned the nickname &amp;quot;Pedro&amp;quot; after a sleazy (slang; &amp;quot;escamoso&amp;quot;, which translates as &amp;quot;scaly&amp;quot;) character in a Colombian soap opera. In addition to the scales on its feet, careful preparation of Inkayacu also uncovered feathers that were preserved in exquisite detail. The feathers on the left wing were especially close to their real life position, appearing to be only slightly ruffled (Figure 2, below; A &amp;amp; B scale = 1 cm):Several feather samples (red circles) were taken for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis (refer to the insets in Figure 2). As expected, the samples contained fossilised melanosomes. These are tiny sausage-shaped structures filled with pigments that are located inside cells. Melanosomes are nearly ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom; providing a vast palette of colors to crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. Jakob Vinther, a co-author on the paper, used SEM to photograph the structure of the fossil penguin melanosomes and feathers. Mr Vinther, a graduate student at Yale University, studies ink sacs in fossil squids. He discovered the melanosomes in the fossil penguin feathers in 2008, shortly after he first noticed melanosomes in the feathers of another ancient bird fossil. To identify the colours of the ancient feathers, team members Matthew Shawkey, an assistant professor of biology and integrated bioscience at the University of Akron, and Liliana D&amp;#39;Alba, a postdoctoral researcher who works with Dr Shawkey, compared the Inkayacu samples (Figure 3A and B) to similar structures in modern birds.Dr Shawkey and Dr D&amp;#39;Alba have been constructing an encyclopedia of avian melanosomes for comparative purposes. &amp;quot;My post-doc Liliana and I have built (and continue to build) a dataset of melanosome morphology from feathers of different colours,&amp;quot; explained Dr Shawkey in an email. &amp;quot;This enables us to predict feather colour from morphology, which is very useful when you only have fossilised melanosomes to work with.&amp;quot;When they compared the fossil penguin melanosomes to those of modern penguins (Little Blue Penguin, Eudyptula minor, Figure 3C), they were in for a surprise. &amp;quot;We thought the extant penguin melanosomes would fit right in with those from the other extant birds, but it turned out to be more interesting than that,&amp;quot; said Dr Shawkey. Although the fossil melanosomes are quite similar to those in modern birds, they are much smaller than those found in modern penguins, as you can see in the above figure (compare panels A and C in Figure 3). Modern penguins&amp;#39; melanosomes are giants; much larger and broader than those found in the feathers of other living birds and in the fossil penguin feathers. The team also noted that their modern penguins&amp;#39; melanosomes are packed into clusters that resemble bunches of grapes, another feature that sets them apart from all other birds. Comparisons with modern avian melanosomes of known coloration showed that each of the six Inkayacu samples most closely resembled modern bird melanosomes that were grey or reddish-brown. Interestingly, modern penguin chicks are either grey or a reddish-brown color. But the fossil bones are from an adult penguin, not a juvenile. According to Dr Shawkey, he and Dr D&amp;#39;Alba are investigating the feathers of penguin chicks now. I asked Dr Shawkey if they have examined melanosomes from other largely aquatic birds.  &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve looked at loons and boobies and some ducks and they all fit in pretty well with the non-aquatic birds,&amp;quot; said Dr Shawkey. &amp;quot;Of course, those aren&amp;#39;t such prolific swimmers and divers as penguins.&amp;quot; I also wondered if they had examined melanosomes from another highly aquatic bird family, the auks - the northern hemisphere&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ecological equivalent&amp;quot; to penguins.&amp;quot;We haven&amp;#39;t looked at auks yet, although that&amp;#39;s high on the list,&amp;quot; said Dr Shawkey. &amp;quot;Unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t think we have any fossil auks preserved with feathers,&amp;quot; added Mr Vinther. &amp;quot;But that is an interesting thing to pursue.&amp;quot;The researchers also noted structural differences in the feathers. Using these data, the researchers reconstructed a phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) for penguins on the basis of specific features of their melanosomes and feather structure (lack of differentiation between stacked remiges and greater coverts; densely packed, squamiform lesser coverts; and broad flattened contour feather rachises seen in extant penguins [insets]), all characters that appeared no later than the early Eocene, roughly 34m years ago. The fossil record provides additional detail that was mapped onto this phylogenetic tree, showing that Inkayacu and other extinct giant penguins were very successful during the Eocene - they ranged all over the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctica: blue; New Zealand: green; Africa: dark gray; South America: red; in Figure 4).&amp;quot;[This tree] tells us that after diverging roughly 34m years before Inkayacu, penguins were already pretty well adapted to aquatic flight [since their] heavy bones and modified feather shape are pretty much the same as modern penguins&amp;#39;,&amp;quot; said Dr Shawkey. &amp;quot;However, their coloration clearly shifted, perhaps in response to the selection pressures imposed by new predators - especially seals - that emerged in the late oligocene (~23 mya).&amp;quot; Modern penguins are counter-shaded so that they blend in with the light when seen from below and with the dark when seen from above, but clearly, Inkayacu was not. Was this lack of counter shading shared by all the giant penguins? If so, may this be the reason that all of the giant penguins are now extinct?&amp;quot;By looking at the way these fossilised feathers differ from those of living penguins, we may be able to learn more about why species like Inkayacu became extinct, while the smaller modern species continue to survive today,&amp;quot; said Daniel Ksepka, co-author on the paper and an assistant research professor of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University. But this phylogenetic tree does not reveal how or why penguin feathers changed over time. Part of that secret might lie in the odd shape of modern penguins&amp;#39; melanosomes.&amp;quot;The hypothesis that we present [in the paper] is based on the fact that we know that melanosomes are involved not only in pigmentation but they also strengthen the feather,&amp;quot; said Mr Vinther in an email message. Feather strength is important, particularly when making a major life history transition from aerial flight to aquatic flight. Since penguins live in an environment where the substrate [water] is 800 times denser than air, their feathers are subject to a lot of wear and tear. Thus, it is possible that these modified melanosomes provide more strength to their feather.&amp;quot;I consider a hydrodynamic explanation for the unusual melanosome shape, as indicated by Clarke et al, to...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once produced &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/01/shell-midden.html"&gt;a small shell midden&lt;/a&gt; in my kitchen. Just now I made a small clearance cairn in the garden. My wife has ordered a peony bush from Gansu in China via a plant dealer in Turku, Finland, and I picked it up at a trucking firm the other day. Now it fell upon me to dig the hole and plant the thing. While digging I set aside all the stones I came upon, as lo-tech farmers have done for millennia, only at a smaller scale. And thus my little cairn.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has a story in Saturday’s paper about the CFI rift that’s been happening for a while now and isn’t much of a surprise to people who know the players.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s only disappointing because instead of focusing on a lot of the good work the CFI has done historically (and recently, under &lt;strong&gt;Ron Lindsay&lt;/strong&gt;), reporter &lt;strong&gt;Mark Oppenheimer&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/us/02beliefs.html"&gt;focusing on the clash between Lindsay and &lt;strong&gt;Paul Kurtz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to Mr. Kurtz, there were two areas of conflict. First, he says, Mr. Lindsay changed the work culture. Whereas Mr. Kurtz had managed “in the spirit of a think tank,” Mr. Lindsay brought his legal background to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am used to the academic life, where we don’t impose rules on employees,” Mr. Kurtz said, sitting in his living room. But &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Lindsay, he said, “set up a command system, said these are the rules and laws, and anyone who deviates from that will be investigated.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees were interrogated for minor infractions, Mr. Kurtz said, and several were let go. &lt;strong&gt;“That is like Stalinism or the Inquisition,” Mr. Kurtz said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By phone and by e-mail, Mr. Lindsay said that the “investigations” were due-process inquiries into complaints, and that he had not fired anyone for questioning his authority. He said that four employees were laid off for economic reasons, one resigned, and one freelance employee did not have his contract renewed. Only the center’s spokesman, Nathan Bupp, who left last week, may have been fired; Mr. Lindsay, in an e-mail, would only say, “This was not a layoff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Mr. Kurtz’s second complaint goes beyond internecine power struggles. &lt;strong&gt;He said that Mr. Lindsay was turning the center away from Mr. Kurtz’s humanist philosophy and toward negative, angry atheism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Kurtz, skeptics must do more than just deride religion. “If religion is being weakened, what replaces it in secular society?” he asked. “Most of my colleagues are concerned with critiquing the concept of God. That is important, but equally important is, where do you turn?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the first conflict area, it sounds like an inevitable clash between old and new leadership.  You’re not going to like what your successor does, especially when that person does things very differently.  That’s not a new story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second conflict is more significant.  But if I’ve learned anything in my work within our movement over the past few years, it’s the importance of having many different tactics. We need angry atheists and we need friendly ones. If CFI is accused of being more hostile toward religion, it’s because that’s where the action, fundraising, and interest is in our culture right now.  I don’t blame them for putting more energy into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean I’m a fan of everything CFI’s done recently. A year ago, I was upset with &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/09/30/should-we-blaspheme-not-always/"&gt;how they went about promoting Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more groups we have, the more our message gets out there. If the groups are working together, that message is amplified. CFI has been much more cooperative with other groups in recent years, and that’s a tremendous development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT article is missing the bigger picture here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line in the piece says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Next: In Los Angeles, taking stock of atheism’s future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping for something better in that story… but I’m not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;strong&gt;Erich Vieth&lt;/strong&gt; has an &lt;a href="http://dangerousintersection.org/2010/10/02/expelled-founder-paul-kurtz-explains-his-departure-from-the-center-for-inquiry/"&gt;extensive interview with Kurtz on his website&lt;/a&gt;. They talk quite a bit about his departure from CFI.&lt;br&gt;

(below the fold).   Introduction:Cajal&amp;#39;s illustration of the neuronal diversity in the chick cerebellumOne of the biggest questions asked in the Doe lab is- How is neuronal diversity achieved?  After all, we know that hundreds of completely unique neurons with specific synapses and areas of innervation must develop from single-celled embryos.  To be more specific, we know that neuronal stem cells, or neuroblasts, are unique among stem-cells.  While many stem cells, such as the blood cell producing hematopoietic stem cells, produce only one type of daughter cell throughout their lives, neuroblasts have the ability to produce a wide variety of cells.  We already know that one of the mechanisms that enable neuroblasts to produce different daughter cell types is the presence of transcription factor cascades(transcription factors being nuclear proteins which help to control whether or not a gene is copied into RNA, and eventually protein), which means that neuroblasts produce different daughter cells depending on which transcription factor they happen to be expressing at the time. (Pearson and Doe 2004)Depicting the temporal identity cascade of neuroblast 7-1In the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, we know that the specific transcription factor(or TF) known as Hunchback (Hb) is key to establishing the temporal identity cascade in most neuroblasts.  Furthermore, we know that the transition from Hb expression requires a full cell cycle, including cytokinesis (cell division). (Grosskortenhaus, et al. 2005) However, we also know that the further TF transitions are independent of the cell cycle and function on some as yet unknown timing source.  (Tran &amp;amp; Doe 2008)  Additionally, a neuroblast gradually loses its ability to produce different daughter cell types, even if artificially exposed to different TF&amp;#39;s. (Pearson and Doe 2003) Another observation that was important in formulating this experiment was that neuroblasts decrease in volume as the produce daughter cells.Depicting the gradual loss of pluripotency in neuroblast 7-1One of the least understood forms of gene expression is steric transcription control, and we have implicated it in our model of neuroblast temporal identity determination.  Previous studies have shown how that the gross transcriptional output (the total amount of mRNA copied from the cell&amp;#39;s genes) of a cell is directly correlated with the volume of the cell&amp;#39;s nucleus. (Sato, Burgess, McIlwain 1994)  Also, inflation of nuclei has been reported in many cases as a sign of transcriptional unregulation in cancer cells.  With this knowledge, we began to suspect that the gradual reduction in volume of neuroblasts may be linked to its transcriptional identity! I&amp;#39;ve already described how steric transcriptional control works at the molecular level, but it is important to remember that repositioning of genes to and from the nuclear lamin (membrane) requires a full cell cycle.(Meister, et al. 2010, Reddy, et al. 2008) So, to summarize the assumptions that have gone into developing our hypothesis:•Genes can be controlled by position relative to nuclear membrane (Capelson, et al. 2010, Reddy, et al. 2008, Thakar, et al. 2006, etc.)•As nuclear volume is lost, transcription is impeded (Sato, Burgess, &amp;amp; McIlwain 1994) •Hb transitions are associated with full cell cycles (Grosskortenhaus, et al. 2005, Isshiki, et al. 2001)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Fascinating stuff here about cognitive dissonance and how we deceive ourselves to resolve it. The implications of this book are that we should all be skeptics and trust the sciences. Let me briefly explain.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We humans are irrational in many ways. This is something we should agree about based on the human sciences. What does this imply? We're all in the same epistemological boat. It means we're all in the same boat. Again for emphasis, &lt;i&gt;WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sciences conclusively show that this is how we all think for the most part. Except that there are people who are better critical thinkers than others because they understand this about themselves. For once someone understands what the sciences tell us then that person will question what he claims to know. Such a person will be more demanding of hard evidence before concluding much of anything. Such a person will, in the end, be a skeptic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The major implication is this: We are all in the same boat &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THEREFORE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; we should be skeptics. It's the only reasonable position to take based on the sciences. The only way to escape this conclusion is to reject the sciences. Good luck with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy the book. It's eye opening!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7257662766471453696?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

You can plug it into you wall and thus fuel it off of your local coal burning plant or nuke (yes, folks, plug-in electric cars are terribly inefficient because the electricity is made miles away from where it is used) or, for more efficiency than most (or perhaps any?) hybrid, the car has two internal microturbine engines that will run on a wide range of fuel including biodiesel, compressed natural gas, etc., to charge the batteries, extending the range of the vehicle to about 560 miles.   The turbines can also directly power the  wheels directly if needed.  &lt;/p&gt;

This dinosaur dates to about 85 million years (which falls within the Cretaceous period). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;~ A repost, because it is still an amazing dinosaur ~ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting feature of &lt;em&gt;Aerosteon riocoloradensis&lt;/em&gt; is that it demonstrates the evolution of a bird-like respiratory system in an animal that is definitely not bird-like in most other ways.   Indeed, the authors of this paper imply that this dinosaur's respiratory system represents an early phase in the evolution of the bird's respiratory system.  This is a case of an adaptation arising in one context and later being used in an entirely different context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how evolution often works:  An adaptation arises for one reason, and then that adaptation is employed in a similar way but for a very different purpose (it is "exapted" as Stephen Gould would say) in a later organism.  In this case, we see a lung adapted for a certain kind of efficiency in a terrestrial organism.  Later, if the authors are correct, this same efficiency-enhancing adaptation is used in birds as an adaptation related to flight, an entirely different reason.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;This diagram shows a reconstruction of the dinosaur &lt;em&gt;Aerosteon riocoloradensis&lt;/em&gt; in outline, with the features identified as related to the pneumatic (breathing-related) adaptations indicated.  You can access the original paper on line if you wish to study these features in more detail.  Suffice it to say that there are a lot of pneumatic features of interest!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to understand the significance of this find, it may be helpful to first discuss some interesting things about tetrapod lungs, and bird lungs in particular.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request is an incremental - and long shot - step in a lawsuit that accuses the officials of conspiring to keep the allegations against a Milwaukee priest quiet. The Vatican is not obliged to comply with the request.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve reproduced the University press release below the fold.  The session features Mike Elzinga, a regular Thumb commenter, presenting on “Order, Disorder, and Entropy: Misconceptions and Misuses of Thermodynamics.”  I’ll be there early to have dinner at the Harding before Mike’s presentation: come early too, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science discussed in lay terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science Café engages the public in an open community forum to demystify science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ohio State University at Marion invites the community to the Infinity Restaurant in the historic Harding Hotel, 267 West Center Street, downtown Marion, Tuesday, October 5, 7 p.m., for the first in a yearlong series of free monthly community dialogues on science called Science Café.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first café event of the 2010-2011 series schedule, Michael B. Elzinga of the Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center will lead a discussion entitled, “Order, Disorder, and Entropy: Misconceptions and Misuses of Thermodynamics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Elzinga, there are a number of common misconceptions in our society about order, disorder, entropy, and thermodynamics.  “They impact our perceptions about the universe, our place in it, how we view the history of life on this planet, and how we treat our resources as we search for new sources of energy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central threads running through this Science Café is that matter interacts and condenses into all kinds of patterns; there are no apparent limits.  Having a concise and basic understanding of how the universe behaves provides an excellent backdrop against which to evaluate the claims of those who would have us live our lives by tradition only.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nature cannot be fooled,” Elzinga said.  This Science Café attempts to provide part of that basic understanding in a way that is understandable to the layperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science Cafés involve lively conversations with scientists about current science topics.  Science Cafés are free and open to everyone, and take place in casual settings like pubs and coffeehouses. At a café you can learn about the latest issues in science, chat with a
scientist in plain language, meet new friends, speak your mind, and talk with your mouth full.  The overriding goal of Ohio State Marion´s Science Café is to overcome reluctance to learning about science and to make science less mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;

You may not have learned about the poll's evolution and creationism questions, as they've gotten much less press.  In the poll...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[r]espondents were asked, "Which of these people developed the theory of evolution by natural selection?" and offered the choice of Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and Clarence Darrow. Seventy-one percent of respondents selected the correct answer of Darwin, 6% selected Freud, 3% selected Darrow, and 20% said that they didn't know. (In a 2009 survey conducted by the British Council, 84% of American respondents said that they had heard of Darwin.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were also asked, "And which of these court trials focused on whether evolution could be taught in public schools?" and offered the choice of the Scopes trial, the Salem witch trials, and Brown vs. Board of Education. Only 31% of respondents selected the correct answer of the Scopes trial, 36% selected Brown vs. Board of Education, 3% selected the Salem witch trials, and 30% said that they didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that more than one  million gallons have escaped. That would make it one of the largest ever  in the history of the Midwest. But company officials are sticking with  their earlier estimation of 819,000 gallons.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Map of spill" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;oe=UTF8&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=102725170497469564630.00048c7681580e5559736"&gt;The oil flowed directly into the Kalamazoo River&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, the oil spill happened when the Kalamazoo River was at a &lt;a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/07/michigan-oil-spill-cleanup-a-challenge.html"&gt;historically  high level&lt;/a&gt;. So, when the water went back to its regular banks, it left a  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wizardkitten/4843793140/"&gt;large swath of oily plants and sediments&lt;/a&gt; behind.  Lots of plant material and soil is being collected and bagged up; as toxic waste, it will eventually be landfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you don’t know if you aren’t here in Michigan.  There is a &lt;a title="Map of just Enbridge pipelines" href="http://www.enbridge.com/AboutEnbridge/InteractiveMap.aspx"&gt;HUGE network of pipelines&lt;/a&gt; carrying raw crude and natural gas all through the midwest. And the pipes are old. They’re metal and they run through swamps and wetlands.  &lt;a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN2227320020100922"&gt;They break a lot, in fact.&lt;/a&gt; The Lakehead pipeline carries &lt;a href="http://ostseis.anl.gov/guide/tarsands/index.cfm"&gt;oil and tar sands&lt;/a&gt;, a thick crude that has more heavy metals than conventional oil.  (&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/25/AR2008012503001.html"&gt;Large amounts of water&lt;/a&gt; are used in the extraction of this oil, and the mining is very environmentally destructive.) This crude carries lots of carcinogens–toluene, benzene, and other nasties.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/52620996@N08/4844425312/"&gt;&lt;img title="oiled turtle (which should not be touched with bare hands, BTW)" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/4844425312_1886b06723_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="159"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today (Sept. 30th), there are quite different reports being issued about the status of the clean up.  &lt;a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/michigan/news.newsmain/article/1/0/1707506/Michigan.News/Dredging.begins.along.the.Kalamazoo.River.to.remove.oil.trapped.in.the.river%27s.sediment"&gt;Michigan Radio&lt;/a&gt; says that there’s still a lot of missing oil yet to be accounted for. Enbridge says &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/news-briefing-statements-from-enbridge-news-briefing-on-marshall-michigan-pipeline-leak-september-30-2010-2010-09-30?reflink=MW_news_stmp"&gt;the cleanup is almost completed&lt;/a&gt;. I have been involved in some of the &lt;a title="oily muskrat" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35702113@N02/4841055878/"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="oiled great blue heron" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/52620996@N08/4843807977/"&gt;rehab&lt;/a&gt; efforts, mainly centered around turtles, and they are still recovering 70+ turtles coated in heavy crude &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;.  It takes roughly 2 hours to clean one medium-sized turtle.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeaceusa09/4841568656/"&gt;&lt;img title="Oil spill using picnic tables! (via greenpeace)" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/4841568656_755a4b580c_m.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, fall migration is starting.  What will happen to waterfowl heading south if they land in the Kalamazoo river?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been worse, I guess. Fortunately the spill was stopped &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2010/09/oil_spill_refocuses_attention.html"&gt;before it reached the part of the Kalamazoo river that is a PCB Superfund site&lt;/a&gt;. All those oils would have worked as a solvent, and released lots of pollutants from the sediments they’re now contained in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipe that ruptured is now &lt;a href="http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/article/20100929/NEWS01/9290320/In-the-Neighborhood"&gt;pumping crude again&lt;/a&gt;.  Here’s the really depressing part–7 months ago, the EPA sent Enbridge a  warning letter about possible problems with the pipeline that  ruptured.  And another Enbridge pipeline–a different trunk of the same  oil pathway–&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/us/17cncoilspill.html?_r=1"&gt;ruptured in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; 6 weeks after the Michigan spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do a search for images of the Michigan Oil Spill, what you see are a whole lot of unsafe work practices.  And, also, depressing stuff like this–an oil boom deployed in a city riverside park, using picnic tables to support an oil skimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

Our primary plans for this weekend involve chilling out, staying dry, and taking it easy. But when we’re not busy doing nothing, we’ll be busy with the following pursuits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="woman reading" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/woman-reading-490x400.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="400"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo: Flickr user cliff1066&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Read&lt;/strong&gt; — We’re getting hit by a tropical storm here, people. All we want to do is curl up with a book and a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make Ants on a Log&lt;/strong&gt; — But we’ll be sure to buy a &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/you-organic-peanut-butter-is-hurting-the-environment-10-good-foods-with-bad-palm-oil-habits-and-what-you-should-buy-instead/"&gt;peanut butter that isn’t bad for the environment&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take a Walk&lt;/strong&gt; — If the weather finally clears up, we plan to take full advantage. We’ll be doing so in &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/naya-shoes-eco-friendly-footwear-that-isnt-ugly/"&gt;eco-friendly shoes&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Cheat on Our Diets&lt;/strong&gt; — Just a little fried chicken or pizza won’t kill us, and even &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/can-you-overdose-on-natural-foods-nutritionist-lauren-slayton-weighs-in/"&gt;our favorite nutritionist says that it’s okay to take a break from natural foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Go to the Salon&lt;/strong&gt; — It’s time for a trim (or wax, or whatever else we do to keep ourselves looking decent). But we definitely &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/toxic-beauty-5-common-salon-treatments-to-avoid/"&gt;won’t be getting a Keratin treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Eat Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; — And we’ll be eating it on some &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/marys-gone-crackers-foods-michael-pollan-would-eat/"&gt;Michael Pollan-worthy crackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Wear Sweatpants&lt;/strong&gt; — Because no matter where you live or &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/sweatpants-outside-the-gym-casual-and-cute-or-fashion-faux-pas/"&gt;whether you approve of how they look&lt;/a&gt;, they’re damn comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Play with our Bells&lt;/strong&gt; — Our &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/move/shop-for-your-bod-get-a-kettlebell-from-blisstree-and-opensky/"&gt;Kettlebells&lt;/a&gt;, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Prep for Halloween&lt;/strong&gt; — By coming up with non-&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/the-horror-the-horror-10-worst-halloween-costumes-for-couples/"&gt;nauseating costume ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My proposal: courses in world religions should be mandatory for all public school students, with a focus on Christianity as the most prevalent domestic faith. These courses would examine the philosophical and sociological features of religion, without teachers’ needing to fear that such lessons will be construed as an endorsement or denunciation of any particular doctrine. Within reason, their ability to teach freely and honestly must be unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is patently unacceptable for so many to know so little about what has been by some accounts the prime mover of world history. The only solution is to shift our educational priorities. In learning more about religion, students will also hopefully recognize that the decision to assign oneself a religious faith is not to be taken lightly, as it bears profound metaphysical, social and even political implications. With any luck, they will also glean that the study of religion is incredibly interesting and fulfilling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a proposal that’s nice in theory but not very practical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classes students &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to take at many public schools are limited to what gets tested on standardized tests + a few more classes.  Even then, you might only need two science courses or three math courses.  Adding a religion requirement? Not likely to happen in our current education climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some schools do teach the Bible as literature.  That’s fine, if taught objectively.  And to the inevitable question of “Why &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the Bible?” I agree with Michael that it’s the predominant religion in our country and ought to be studied because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had the option to take a World Religions class in high school, would you have taken it?  Did you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I’m clearly interested in religion now, I’m not sure I would have taken that class back then.&lt;br&gt;

It&amp;#39;s a period of tremendous change but, once set, few people undergo and radical changes.

Even so, some kids change, while others do not. It&amp;#39;s interesting to speculate on why that might be. What separates the changers from those who stay the same? Is it genetics, or is it environment?

A recent study has looked at this using data from two twin studies in Colorado, USA. The basic idea is simple: they measured religiosity at around 12-18 years old, and then again around 5 years later.

By comparing identical twins with non-identical twins, you can estimate the importance of three factors contributing to the change: 

Genetics (what&amp;#39;s shared by identical twins but not non-identical ones),

Family or shared environment (what&amp;#39;s shared by twins after you take out the genetic component, but not shared by individuals not brought up together)

Non-shared environment (what&amp;#39;s left, which is basically whatever it is that causes twins to be different).

Now, it has to be said that there are a lot of caveats to these kinds of studies. The gene-environment interaction is complicated, and the effect of genes in one environment likely differs from the effect in another - including another genetic environment (i.e. the same gene will have different effects in different people). 

There&amp;#39;s an additional problem when linking genes to personality. The classic example is genes for skin colour. Your skin colour affects the way people treat you, which in turn affects your personality. Gene linkage studies would show that your personality is genetically determined, whereas in truth its the environment (i.e. social prejudice) which is causing the effect!

All in all, lessons from gene studies in Colorado, where the population is mostly religious but undergoing change, do not necessarily apply to Pakistan or Sweden.

That said, take a look at what they found. For those Colorado kids who kept their religious beliefs as they moved into adulthood, the major influence was their family. Not too surprising- your family environment is a major, constant factor.

Interestingly, however genes only play a minor role - especially when it comes to the importance of religion in their lives. Keeping the faith is largely a function of family pressure.

Looking at what lies behind changing religious beliefs, you can see that the external environment (the stuff that one twin is exposed to but the other is no) plays a vital role. Change is driven by outside influence. 

But it&amp;#39;s also driven by genetics - and to a greater extent than religious stability. What this seems to indicate is that some effect of genetics is critical to changing beliefs.

In the case of these Colorado kids, the most common change (in common with kids elsewhere in the USA) was a decrease in religious attendance and also in the importance attached to religion.

So some kids are genetically predisposed to shift their beliefs. Unfortunately, what this study doesn&amp;#39;t tell us is why. Perhaps these genes somehow lead to a rejection of religious worldview. That&amp;#39;s certainly a possibiliy.

But I wonder whether perhaps some kids are just born to be different. Perhaps these kids are becoming non-religious because it shocks the old folks. Perhaps, in a world of atheists, these would be the kids picking up religion!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first straw man I want to examine is the argument that scientific ideas are empirical and testable and religious ideas are not. Coyne compares the well-understood function of penicillin to belief in the incarnation of Jesus and notes that the former is well established as true but the latter is just a matter of faith with nothing more than a “book” to suggest that it might be true. (And, of course, he notes that the “book” of the Christians is just one holy book among several—all of which make different claims with no clear way to adjudicate among them.) . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the situation with the multi-verse today. We have equations with solutions that may or may not describe a reality for which at present there is not a shred of evidence. This uncertainty may resolve itself or it may not. Leading scientists may continue to dispute whether our universe is unique, or one of many, or one of an infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The straw man argument comes into play when we take the simplest settled truths of science and contrast them with the ambiguous and unsettled “truths” of other fields. Science also has many ambiguous and unsettled “truths.” This is not to say that religious truths are thus now on the same playing field with scientific truths. Science purchases its great success by choosing easy problems and thus will always provide a clearer model for thinking than, say theology, or literary criticism, or sociology, or aesthetics. But it does suggest that we should not be exclaiming about how much clearer our understanding of penicillin is than our understanding of the Incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has an unfair advantage over faith because&lt;em&gt; science chooses the easy problems???&lt;/em&gt; Right—establishing the truth of general relativity is just so much simpler than establishing the truth of the Incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a matter of different degrees of difficulty; it’s a matter of religious problems being insoluble because they’re not about reality.&lt;/p&gt;

Bragg Freedom Festival”&lt;/a&gt; — it includes a potential line-up of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been an uproar lately about how an &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/ft-bragg-evangelical-event-draws-fire/story?id=11727193"&gt;Evangelical Christian event took place&lt;/a&gt; at the military base at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrCANcaaYAM"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; is that military leaders were using their positions to promote this event, and that’s simply unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans United for Separation at Church and State &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2010/09/army-must-cancel-evangelistic.html"&gt;explained the problem&lt;/a&gt; this way:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The “Rock the Fort” event at Fort Bragg this weekend targets both military personnel and adults and children in the surrounding community for conversion to Christianity. This clearly violates the separation of church and state, attorneys with Americans United informed Army officials in a &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/media/press-releases/archives/2010/09/evangelical-concert-at-fort.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the Army’s job to convert Americans to Christianity,” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. “This event is totally unacceptable and must be canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2, a letter from the chaplain’s office at Fort Bragg was issued to local churches. The letter, signed by Chaplain David Hillis, urges clergy to take part in the event and notes that it will take “the Christian message to all of Fort Bragg and the surrounding community!” The letter goes on to state that the event is “evangelistic in nature” and that it “will conclude with a clear Gospel message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Army has no business entering into a partnership with evangelical churches to help them win new members,” Lynn said. “I urge Army officials to stop this event and make sure no more take place. In addition, the military must end its relationship with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event went on, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an email from Specialist &lt;strong&gt;Justin Griffith&lt;/strong&gt;, who is stationed at Fort Bragg.  He was initially hesitant, but ultimately courageous enough, to sign his name to this message.  He’s now working on an event of his own…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, home of the famous 82nd Airborne and Special Operations units, was recently the host to an evangelical Christian rock concert. There are about 45,000 people stationed at the base, many of whom are atheist and agnostic soldiers. I am one those soldiers, and I am personally offended at last weekend’s &lt;a href="http://fayobserver.com/articles/2010/09/24/1033965?sac="&gt;“Rock the Fort” concert&lt;/a&gt; organized by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[The Post Commander] Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick wrote that he’s confident the planned “Rock the Fort” event doesn’t infringe on anyone’s freedoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have taken steps to ensure that no soldier in my command is pressured in any way to attend this event,” wrote Helmick, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally received several e-mails from my command inviting me to attend this meeting, and I also received numerous verbal invitations. I am the (not so) proud owner of several flyers and posters that were printed up and handed out to all of the soldiers who attended various events around the post. I’m having a hard time understanding how this event isn’t proselytizing to soldiers, family members, and the local population, which is a strict violation of ethics and even the Chaplaincy’s own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to organize and promote an event to be held at Ft. Bragg with the same level of support, just like the “Rock the Fort” evangelical Christian event held on 9/25/10. Please &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=105314959531054"&gt;join this group and help us plan an event&lt;/a&gt; for Skeptics, Free-Thinkers, Agnostics, Atheists, and those who just want to enjoy a day FREE from religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Helmick also wrote that Bragg would provide the same opportunity to non-Christian religious groups that want to host similar events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to take LTG Helmick up on his word. Please help us out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just brainstorming at this point, and we would like to encourage participation from everyone in the community. We will be holding more meet-ups in the future to refine our approach and to recruit as many like-minded freethinkers as possible. For now, please post your ideas and any areas you’d be willing to contribute. We need entertainment, vendors, sponsors… and most of all we need the expertise of those who have successfully organized and produced a large public festival. Please use &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=105314959531054"&gt;this group&lt;/a&gt; as a forum for discussion and networking. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal dream lineup for the event would include &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6w8hVv4Ko"&gt;They Might Be Giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYuDjc_w1qI&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Bad Religion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh6lJlWlajY"&gt;Spoonboy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2Co39hWoUo"&gt;Jeffrey Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0W7Jbc_Vhw"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; handling the music, and a roster of speakers from the blogosphere, lithosphere, and various pro-science (NAS and the NCSE) and separation of church and state groups (ACLU, Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation), student organizations like the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.uncg.edu/student.groups/atheists/constitution.html"&gt;UNCG Atheists&lt;/a&gt; handling the prose. Please help spread the word far and wide, because this will be the first event of its kind held on one of the largest and most famous military bases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very Respectfully,&lt;br&gt;
SPC Justin Griffith
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’d rather the Christian groups stop proselytizing, I think this would be a terrific way to respond.&lt;br&gt;

Effexor and Cymbalta impact both serotonin and norepinephrine, so they should be more effective than SSRI’s in treating depression?  Mind you, that’s not a high bar to clear - it’s not like SSRI’s are much better than placebo.  So get the hell outta the way, Prozac and Paxil, because Cymbalta and Effexor will unleash their incredible efficacy onto the world of psychiatry.  Doubt me?  Read this 2009 article regarding the wonders of Pristiq (son of Effexor) and learn about how “The emergence of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) antidepressants has improved the treatment of MDD.” Or this press release from Wyeth.  Or Dr. Danny Carlat’s experience selling Effexor to his peers.   I don’t think anyone who has followed drug marketing would deny that both Wyeth and Lilly tried to pimp Effexor and Cymbalta as working better because of their SNRI properties.  But is that actually true?  A team of German researchers examined the data and concluded that neither Effexor nor Cymbalta really work better than SSRIs.  They actually found a small advantage for Effexor over SSRIs for treatment response (but not depression remission), but they also found that the manufacturer was hiding studies from them (and the rest of the world). I haven’t said this for a while, but enter Charles Nemeroff. To understand the research by the Germans, we first need to recall that a 2008 study (lead author: Nemeroff) found ...the pooled effect size across all comparisons of venlafaxine versus SSRIs reflected an average difference in remission rates of 5.9%, which reflected a NNT of 17 (1/.059), that is, one would expect to treat approximately 17 patients with venlafaxine to see one more success than if all had been treated with another SSRI. Although this difference was reliable and would be important if applied to populations of depressed patients, it is also true that it is modest and might not be noticed by busy clinicians in everyday practice. Nonetheless, an NNT of 17 may be of public health relevance given the large number of patients treated for depression and the significant burden of illness associated with this disorder. [my emphasis]As I wrote then, the benefit to public health claim is ridiculous.  To understand the reasons why this is so laughable, please check out my prior post on the topic.  This meta-analysis included a bunch of data from Wyeth that was previously unpublished...Which leads to the freshly published meta-analysis on how Effexor compares to SSRIs.  The German researchers requested unpublished data from Wyeth and only got some...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s winner was easy because she was thrice-nominated. THRICE! Congratulations Glow-Orb, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/09/skepchick-quickies-9-24-2/comment-page-1/#comment-110801"&gt;who pontificates on the reason&lt;/a&gt; why we all just love the color pink so damn much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1: There are things in this world that are for you. There are things in this world that are not for you. You will know the things that are for you because they have your mark. Your mark is pink. Your clothes are pink; your room is pink; your toys are pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 374: There are things in this world that are for you. There are things in this world that are not for you. When you choose the correct things you will be praised, hugged, and rewarded with positive noises from the people around you. When you choose the incorrect things you will be ignored, laughed at or punished with negative noises from the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1260: You love pink. It has always been that way. It must be inherent to your sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two runners-up after the jump! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been saying this exact same thing for months now. I’m just waiting for the broadcast where he goes, “Just kidding! Wow I can’t believe how many assholes there are in this country. Anyway thanks for all the money, and I’ve been voting Democrat since 1978. Assholes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a genius blog where people submit photos of – well – all kinds of shit their kids have ruined, and here are five of our absolute favorite photo posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_0602 (Small)" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/IMG_0602-Small-490x367.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367"&gt;&lt;p&gt;image courtesy of &amp;quot;Shit My Kids Ruined&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, that’s exactly what you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="glitter-kids" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/glitter-kids-490x367.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367"&gt;&lt;p&gt;image courtesy of &amp;quot;Shit My Kids Ruined&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;Glitter game gone ghastly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="garage-wall" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/garage-wall-490x367.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367"&gt;&lt;p&gt;image courtesy of &amp;quot;Shit My Kids Ruined&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;Automatic garage door opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="RED-TODDLERS" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/RED-TODDLERS-490x326.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326"&gt;&lt;p&gt;image courtesy of &amp;quot;Shit My Kids Ruined&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;The reason you’re seeing red is because there’s a lot of red to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:500px"&gt;&lt;img title="keyfob" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/keyfob-490x479.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="479"&gt;&lt;p&gt;image courtesy of &amp;quot;Shit My Kids Ruined&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;Either don’t leave $300 key fob next to garbage disposal, or sell the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

But one thing we don’t like about our technology habit is what it does for the environment: Our old computers, iPods, speakers, televisions, and VHS players aren’t doing our landfills any favors, and either are the factories churning out new motherboards, plastic cases, and power cords. That’s why we’re pretty crazy about &lt;a href="http://rebaroque.com/"&gt;Rebaroque&lt;/a&gt;, a Brooklyn-based company that uses reclaimed frames, fabric scraps, and found wood to make speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic-looking iPod docs and ugly home stereo systems: Beware. Rebaroque’s speakers look cool and have a lot of personality, and they come with a cord for easy mp3-player hookup. They’re pretty enough that you’d want to keep them around for awhile (not throw them away as soon as there’s a better model on sale), and we love that they’re made from reclaimed and found materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only drawback is that we can’t tell you how much they are, or how long it will take you to buy them. The company is pretty new, so we’re waiting to find out more about how to get them on our own walls. &lt;em&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href="http://rebaroque.com/"&gt;rebaroque.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/breast-cancer/awareness-month/prevent"&gt;Prevention.com has 30 tips for avoiding the Big C.&lt;/a&gt; Here are three of our faves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Become a sun-worshipper (sort of).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;People who get the most vitamin D, which lies dormant in skin until ultraviolet rays activate it, may protect themselves from a variety of cancers, including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, breast, and colon. Ironically, it even improves survival rates of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. But 10 to 15 minutes a few days a week is all it takes to benefit. (Or you could try a supplement – aim for 400 IU a day.) If you’re out any longer than that, slather on the sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for citrus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;It just may zap a strain of the H. pylori bacteria that causes peptic ulcers and can lead to stomach cancer. Researchers in San Francisco found that infected people with high levels of vitamin C in their blood were less likely to test positive for the cancer-causing strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam your greens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Piles of studies have shown that piles of broccoli help stave off ovarian, stomach, lung, bladder, and colorectal cancers. And steaming it for 3 to 4 minutes enhances the power of the cancer-fighting compound sulforaphane, which has been shown to halt the growth of breast cancer cells. (Sorry, microwaving doesn’t do the trick; it strips out most antioxidants.) Get more protection by sprinkling a handful of selenium-rich sunflower seeds, nuts, or mushrooms on your greens. Researchers are discovering that sulforaphane is about 13 times more potent when combined with the mineral selenium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/breast-cancer/awareness-month/prevent"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the entire list on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/breast-cancer/awareness-month/prevent"&gt;AOL Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="matt and lena&amp;#39;s green home tour" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/matt-and-lenas-green-home-tour.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House to Drool Over: &lt;a href="http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/matt-and-lenas-cabinet-of-curiosities-green-tour-128210"&gt;Matt and Lena’s Cabinet of Curiosities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We’d never guess that this homey-looking apartment was in one of Oakland’s brand new developments, but owners Matt and Lina decided it was worth giving up old-fashioned charms for the green building that’s just two minutes from work. We like their style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/matt-and-lenas-cabinet-of-curiosities-green-tour-128210"&gt;&lt;img title="reclaimed wood desk" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/reclaimed-wood-desk-490x328.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="328"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIY Project: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/creative-reuse/simple-diy-reclaimed-wood-desk-128404"&gt;Reclaimed Wood Desk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This DIY project is recycling at its best: It’s practical to make and use, and it also makes using reclaimed materials affordable for those of us who can’t afford an eco-minded interior designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="castor_sauna_1" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/castor_sauna_1-490x653.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="653"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects of Desire: &lt;a href="http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/green-style/green-style-the-prefab-sauna-box-from-castor-128335"&gt;Castor Pre-Fab Sauna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This wood-burning sauna is built into a shipping container, and it runs entirely on solar power and a wood-burning stove. They even come with a sink, iPod stereo, guitar hookup, stool, magnetic truck light, and bronze antlers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="2010_9_28_hothowtos" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/2010_9_28_hothowtos-490x544.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="544"&gt;Home How-To: &lt;a href="http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/roundup/our-top-30-howto-posts-of-all-time-post-roundup-128216"&gt;Re-Nest’s Top 30 How-To Posts of All Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;What’s not to love about 30 eco-friendly how-tos? We’re suckers for lists…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="coyuchi_rect540" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/10/coyuchi_rect540-490x370.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="370"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Greening: &lt;a href="http://http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/bedding-blankets/the-10-best-organic-bedding-sourcesshoppers-guide-128267"&gt;10 Best Organic Bedding Sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;As Apartment Therapy points out, you spend a lot of time in your bed, so making it as healthy and earth-friendly as possible should be high on your list of home decor priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

But our parent company, b5 media, is looking for some college students to help with some new business development and social media initiatives, and these positions just can’t wait until the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you (or someone you know) put off applying to an internship this semester, found you have a little bit of extra time in your schedule or just want to squeeze in a little more experience by working for an online media company, we might have the perfect opportunity for you. Or, at the very least, you can see &lt;a href="http://thegloss.com/career/dispatches-from-an-all-female-office/"&gt;how weird we all are in person&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B5 media is the publisher of not just Blisstree but our sister sites, &lt;a href="http://www.thegloss.com"&gt;The Gloss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.crushable.com"&gt;Crushable&lt;/a&gt;. Our New York offices include editorial teams for all three sites as well as sales, marketing and business development departments. There’s lots of work that goes into producing three sites beyond the writing, reporting and editing you see here everyday, and if you’re interested in things like social media, e-commerce and sales, there’s so much opportunity to learn firsthand and see how a web start-up works. Plus, you don’t have to wear suits and you might just score a free product or an invite to a fun party or event every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for interns to work specifically with the business development and marketing team, where you’ll work all day on Twitter and Facebook and selling products through our OpenSky platform. The time commitment is minimal: just one or two days a week, for 6 to 10 hours per week. Our internships are unpaid, but we can offer class credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, or just want more information, contact Amanda Ernst at &lt;a href="mailto:amanda@b5media.com"&gt;amanda at b5media dot com&lt;/a&gt;. To apply, send a cover letter explaining why you want to work here along with your resume.&lt;/p&gt;

By the time we’re thinking clearly, we’re usually more worried about &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/espresso-hold-the-milk-what-you-should-order-at-the-coffee-shop/"&gt;what kind of coffee to drink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/coffee-grounds-do-you-put-them-in-the-garbage-or-garden/"&gt;what to do with our coffee grounds&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s post from GOOD’s blog, &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/what-s-really-in-your-toothpaste/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s Really In Your Toothpaste?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, got us thinking about what’s really going into our mouths (and down the drain) twice a day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOD’s slideshow considers a few common toothpaste ingredients that you might want to rethink, both from a health perspective and an environmental one. The fluoride you hope keeps your cavities at bay is far from benign: many scientists think it’s unsafe to put in drinking water and in your oral care products. Then there’s the scarier prospect of ingredients like Sodium Laureth Sulfate — a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;detergent&lt;/em&gt;. To find out more about what’s lurking in your toothpaste, check out their slideshow, &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/what-s-really-in-your-toothpaste/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you give up your favorite tube for a natural brand? Do you already use an eco-friendly, natural toothpaste that you love? Tell us in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

Pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first story is titled &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11430795"&gt;Male infertility gene discovered&lt;/a&gt;. It does an OK job of describing the actual study and even gets into the nuances farther in, but the lead is awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #1: Do not describe genes by the disease they cause when broken. This is a gene that &lt;i&gt;contributes&lt;/i&gt; to male &lt;b&gt;fertility&lt;/b&gt;. There is no infertility gene. If a man has a missing, damaged, or mutant form of this fertility gene, he may have problems conceiving children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #2: Get some perspective. Deeper in, the story casually mentions that only 4% of men with fertility problems have a mutant allele of this gene. This is a non-story. Hundreds (at least) of genes contribute to fertility. What this is is a routine tale of a clinical observation, part of normal, ordinary science, that may be the grist of the scientific mill, but isn't worth a superficial news item about one datum. How about writing a story about genetic factors in general that affect fertility? That would at least have some context. As is, this is an inflated press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another news item: &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11437079"&gt;New study claims ADHD has 'direct genetic link'&lt;/a&gt;. It's far less impressive than the headline suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #3: Comprehend the science first. This study does not show a direct link. Instead, it finds that children diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to have a spectrum of diverse genetic abnormalities. Cause and effect are not demonstrated. Specific ADHD-related genes are not identified. It shows a correlation between one measure of physical health and another measure of neurological properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #4: Learn this simple principle: genes affect how your body responds to environmental factors. Finding an allele associated with a particular physiological state does not mean you have described a cause. We also need to know how that gene acts, what triggers a particular pattern of expression, and what the gene changes in the cell. There are forms of genes that only have deleterious (or advantageous) effects given certain conditions; that effect &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be described as a consequence of both the gene and a certain background or environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I feel better getting that off my chest. I just get so annoyed at this tendency for the media to focus on simplistic discrete causes that are split into a black &amp;amp; white nature or nurture false dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/science_journalists_no_more_si.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/fm8a7eAVX5E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285959471900"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/jims_mom_pwns_bachmann-clone_p.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/87713a7f27d2d561</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Jim's Mom pwns Bachmann-Clone Paulsen</title><published>2010-10-01T19:47:33Z</published><updated>2010-10-01T19:47:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/DM0lendx5J0/jims_mom_pwns_bachmann-clone_p.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/jims_mom_pwns_bachmann-clone_p.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My local congressional race is getting interesting.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/jims_mom_pwns_bachmann-clone_p.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/10/jims_mom_pwns_bachmann-clone_p.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/DM0lendx5J0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285959055623"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_in_which_i_am_gi_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bd01492c135823e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Your Friday Dose of Woo: In which I am given a woo-ducation in neuroscience</title><published>2010-10-01T19:30:00Z</published><updated>2010-10-01T19:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/uudqjCKOElA/your_friday_dose_of_woo_in_which_i_am_gi_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_in_which_i_am_gi_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic Insolence logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2006/08/ClassicInsolence.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every so often, real life intrudes on blogging, preventing the creation of fresh Insolence, at least Insolence of the quality that you've come to expect. This is one of those times, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/the_patented_orac_nih_r01_distraction_op.php"&gt;thanks to R01 deadlines&lt;/a&gt;. So enjoy this bit of Classic Insolence from back in September 2007 that, shockingly, as far as I can tell I've never "rerun" before. Remember, if you've been reading less than three years it's probably new to you, and, even if you have been reading more than three years, it's fun to see how posts like this have aged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I usually do on Thursday nights, I was perusing my legendary Folder of Woo looking for just the thing to be interesting and entertaining to both me as the blogger and you as the reader.  As happens occasionally, nothing was really doing it for me. Nothing was getting me fired up to launch into yet another installment of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about going back to the well of &lt;a href="http://www.lifetechnology.org/"&gt;Life Technology&lt;/a&gt; (believe it or not, there is still some woo there to which I have not yet applied my special brand of Respectful Insolence™), but somehow I just wasn't in the mood. Let's face it, after over a year of doing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;, in which I've missed only three or four weeks total, it all starts to sound the same. It takes a special brand of woo to get me really fired up these days. (Does that mean I'm suffering woo burnout? I certainly hope not!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came across it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been stored in the Folder of Woo several weeks earlier. I couldn't remember where or how I had come across it. I did, however, remember that it inspired me as a bit of the most delicious woo. It inspired me because it taught me things I never knew about cellular biology and neuroscience. Morever, it totally took me by surprise, because at first glance it just looked like typical New Age spiritualist B.S. But do not be fooled. Disguised under that veneer of references to "divine primordial energy" and "hidden secrets of the soul" was the most ludicrous bit of "science-y" sounding stuff I've heard in a while. Little did I know that I was about to enter a world of brand new receptors that no neuroscientist had ever heard of, much less described, before. But first, here's the prelude, which should make you see why &lt;a href="http://www.tybro.com/html/spiritual_texts.html?gclid=CPnW-7Xvxo4CFQ2aOAodEC3MwA"&gt;what followed took me completely by surprise&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_in_which_i_am_gi_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_in_which_i_am_gi_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/uudqjCKOElA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285958431213"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=21337">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8fa35fd5694b379</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Bad drink</title><published>2010-10-01T18:30:30Z</published><updated>2010-10-01T18:30:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/M8GVQWKBKTA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/01/bad-drink/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the temptations of being a skeptic is knowing how easy it is to fool people, and wanting to use that knowledge to get filthy rich scamming marks. Watching homeopaths, astrologers, psychics, and others roll around in twenty dollar bills gets old fast, especially when I see skeptics starved for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, I get ideas. I’ve come up with lots of ways to make a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of cash, including one that is &lt;em&gt;absolutely guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to make me millions of dollars with minimal initial investment on my part. I’m not kidding– I mentioned it to my wife, and her eyes lit up comically like a Bugs Bunny cartoon, with little dollar signs in her irises&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sRDhbC46aKs/TJqvZ2r8TMI/AAAAAAAAAKw/8soOsXlQHKs/s1600/Plait+Tech-Tonics1A.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/Plait-Tech-Tonics.jpg" alt="Plait-Tech-Tonics" title="Plait-Tech-Tonics" width="300" height="388"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But I can’t do it: it’s dishonest, and goes against everything I stand for. Stupid scruples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the temptation is there, and it gets worse when other people come up with great ideas, like what Pareidolius whipped up on Hell’s News Stand: &lt;a href="http://hellsnewsstand.blogspot.com/2010/09/baby-needs-new-pair-of-shoes-real-bad.html"&gt;Plait Tech-Tonics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to endorse this? With a slogan like &amp;quot;Dark energy, light taste&amp;quot; it can’t lose! We’ll make tons of money, and then use it to fund vaccine clinics, skeptic groups, critical thinking books and workshops for schools… but. But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. It would still be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being right and honest and ethical sucks. &amp;quot;Taste the sciencey goodness!&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; And don’t even ask. Duh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Following the trail of clues available researchers have independently concluded that humans evolved through systems of monogamy, polygyny, as well as polyamory. However only one can be the culprit and, like a detective interrogating multiple suspects, the solution ultimately depends on which account you&amp;#39;re willing to believe. Last year Owen Lovejoy made the case for monogamy based on the fossil remains of the early human ancestor Ardipithecus ramidus. Meanwhile, Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá have argued that polyamory (or, more precisely, a multimale-multifemale mating system) is the most likely scenario from an analysis that emphasized anthropology, behavioral biology, and physiology. To further complicate matters the third suspect in this mystery, polygyny, has been the conclusion from scientists conducting DNA analyses. These conflicting accounts therefore require careful detective work in order to determine which story is the most convincing.Read the rest of the post here and stay tuned for the next entry in The Primate Diaries in Exile tour.Hammer, M., Mendez, F., Cox, M., Woerner, A., &amp;amp; Wall, J.

Credit: ESA Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are scary things.   The occur when populations of algae explode in coastal environments.  The algae suck up the oxygen and release neurotoxins into the water, and even the local air.   Fisheries and beaches have to be shut down.  People have been killed.  HABs aren&amp;#39;t predictable, but its clear that they more damaging and more common than they were in the past due to nutrient pollution in coastal areas.Some recent studies on HABs have got me thinking about the long-term effects of these events.  First, Melissa Miller and her team document a new threat - transport of toxins from HABs across space and up the food chain.  In an excellent forensic study, they traced the the death of sea otters in Monterey Bay to toxins released by an algal bloom in a freshwater lake 8 km inland.  While the toxins that flowed out to sea in small amount, they were accumulated and concentrated by filter-feeding clams and mussels, the otters&amp;#39; favorite foods.On the other side of the planet, a team of researchers have published an account of the damage wreaked by a HAB that spanned over 500 square kilometers.   They studied the effects of the bloom on two coral reefs and found massive changes in their community structures.  The mechanism? &amp;quot;Changes in species composition at both locations were mainly due to the reduction and/or complete elimination of the majority of species.&amp;quot;The authors suggest that HABs have similar effects to severe coral bleaching event.   As I&amp;#39;ve discussed before, such events can result in regime shifts that are very hard to reverse. To me, these studies highlight the potential for HABs, and other sudden events, to induce long-term changes in ecology and ecosystem services that extend far beyond the scope of direct damage from the blooms themselves.  In particular, I wonder about their ability to cause chains of cascading regime shifts.   Stephen Carpenter recently published a paper describing the forecasting problems posed by such cascades.﻿  Suffice to say, we don&amp;#39;t know how to do it yet.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their pet hot-button issues. I have quite a few of them, actually, because that’s the kind of annoying, self-righteous gal I am. But if there is one issue that is guaranteed to fire me up fastest and with the most indignation, it’s book banning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/robots-bg.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/robots-bg.png" alt="" title="robots-bg" width="500" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand it. In any of its forms – banning, censoring, burning. It’s all part and parcel of the same act. Whether it’s bullying a library to remove a book from its shelves or publicly lighting on fire books by which one is offended, people attempting taking away from other people the right and responsibility to make up their own minds pretty much sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for all of you who were hoping to see me all fired up, we just so happen to be wrapping up 2010’s &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Banned Books Week&lt;/a&gt;. This last week of September is set aside to discuss books that have been challenged and in some cases removed from libraries and bookstores across the US. As far as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;majority of these books go&lt;/a&gt;, for most enlightened, civilized folks, defending them isn’t that difficult. I mean, seriously, getting outraged over &lt;em&gt;Catcher in the Rye&lt;/em&gt; is so quaint I can hardly believe anyone can do it with a straight face these days. And &lt;em&gt;And Tango Makes Three&lt;/em&gt;, a.k.a. the gay penguin book? If you’re not a bigot and/or crazy penguin-hater, it’s not really a problem. &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;? Okay, maybe I think there are better things you could be reading than that. But, at age nine, I read pretty much every &lt;em&gt;Babysitter’s Club&lt;/em&gt; book that ever existed three times over and I still survived to become a relatively unscathed adult. It’s not worth it to pull &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; off of the shelf completely and literally take that decision out of someone else’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s the rub, right? This is all easy enough when the books in question fit our values, or at the least seem harmless against them. But when we encounter those books that are less worthwhile, it becomes more complicated. And less worthwhile books are certainly out there. There are books that have virtually no educational or artistic value, and there are books that promote misinformation and agendas of the most despicable kind. Surely we have to draw the line somewhere? We do, but this is a good place to employ one of the most famous quotes about speech censorship, by Clare Booth Luce: “Censorship, like charity, should begin at home; but, unlike charity, it should end there.” We can, ideally, all agree to pick and choose according to our individual preferences and opinions and let others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, I believe, the essential message of Banned Books Week, and it’s a good one. However, I’d like to add another message to the occasion. Instead of just letting books that we don’t want sit on the shelf rather than destroying them, what if we start challenging people to pick those up too? Instead of treating books as ends in themselves (which they are, which is good), I think it would be interesting if we also considered them more as means to another end – namely, stretching, exercising and shaping the capabilities of our brains. This goes more to the heart of why books are important to value and protect in the first place. Books are more than the sum of the words they contain. They’re tools for learning how to understand and relate to the world around us, and tools for learning how to change it, too. Inherent in that is a lesson even us enlightened, civilized, book-reading folks can stand to be reminded of periodically – if we want to keep our minds in shape, we need to challenge ourselves with our reading choices. Not only does that continue our own progressions, it’s a great example for those who still need to pick up the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Bible. Read the Qur’an. Read Shakespeare, Twain and Wilde. Read Sagan. Read Salinger. Read Bradbury. Read Orwell, Rand and Marx. Read Hawking, Dawkins and Rushdie. Read &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;. Read &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Just &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt;. Read everything you can get your hands on – and, in this day and age, that’s virtually limitless. Read what challenges you, what bores you, what upsets you, not only so that you can learn more about it, but so you can develop those mental muscles that examine, process and decide. Just like training your body to run a marathon, you can’t train your mind to reason without pushing it past its current comfort limits. Read so you can learn to think for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once you’ve got that down, go out and fight like hell so that everyone else can do the exact same thing. Stand up against book banning, book desecration, book censorship. Whether or not you believe these collections of paper and printed words have any inherent symbolic worth, the fact is you can’t stop all of those who would destroy them. &lt;strong&gt;And they’re out there&lt;/strong&gt;. You can’t personally restock all library shelves or physically pull books out of the hands of every single person who would rip them to shreds. So maybe the only thing you can do is to hold up a book as a symbol of the individual human capacity for reason, thought and progress. And fight for that. I protect books – &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; books, even books I don’t like – because, otherwise, I feel I’m betraying that. If we never take the risk of allowing repulsive or useless ideas to print and propagate, we’ll never develop a population that knows how to come up with something better. We will just continue building on ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere out there, there are people whose lives have been enriched, shaped and maybe even saved by books. I know, because I’m one of them. They’re important to me not just for what they contain, but for what they’ve taught me to do. I grew up without religion and without much family. I was often alone, and the only constant that has remained throughout my life is the written word. Because of books – good books, bad books and every kind of book in between – I know how find and evaluate information, ask questions and come to my own conclusions. That’s an essential part of who I am, and that’s what I think about each time Banned Books Week rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that the week is over – let’s go out and read. We might disagree with some of the ideas you find, or we might not like the books we see others reading. But that’s good. That means it’s working. Let’s keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hug An Atheist Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/23/go-hug-an-atheist-in-eastern-kentucky/"&gt;this was controversial&lt;/a&gt;.  The students chalked the campus with phrases like, “No God? No Problem” and “THOU SHALT NOT… Haha, just kidding!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the event is over, it looks like some religious groups on campus have learned a lesson — when chalking, make the messages polite and pleasant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Olp_hC6aWQ/TKOdUyGwQnI/AAAAAAAAAAU/sZflNOm7ttI/s1600/DSCN0227.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Olp_hC6aWQ/TKOdUyGwQnI/AAAAAAAAAAU/sZflNOm7ttI/s1600/DSCN0227.JPG" title="Chalking" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alec Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;, the president of the SSA group, &lt;a href="http://greatmangenesis.blogspot.com/2010/09/round-1fight.html"&gt;comments on this development&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What once was plain, old, hell-condemning chalk is now bright, positive, and attention grabbing advertisements from those groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this amusing and all around a good thing really. I am not sure if they are just trying to get the media’s attention… or simply [trying to] lash back at us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sees this as competition or a way of fighting back.  I don’t see it that way.  I think the Christians on campus realized the positive response generated by messages that don’t condemn people who disagree with you.  They reach out to already like-minded people.  The Christians may have even taken it one step further by leaving messages that don’t attempt to proselytize.  Instead of seeing it as the Christians “getting even,” I prefer to think that the atheists raised the bar for the type of discourse we all want to see on campus.&lt;br&gt;

[I know someone is trying to make headway in that field so don't get me wrong]. I am as certain that Christianity is false as I am that Scientology or Mormonism is false. If I'm risking hell you would think I must be sure of it, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are all justifiably certain that some ideas and theories are wrong. It's easy to do. We merely conclude the case has not been made. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these are not beliefs of mine. I am not affirming anything. I'm denying something. I deny the cases have been made. Some cases I have never even considered before, but tell me of them and I'll deny them without further thought. We all do this. So I am not doing anything out of the ordinary when I do so.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take what happened at Custer's last stand as one example. What happened? Well I know for certain what did not happen and I could name you off-hand about a hundred things that did not happen. Jesus didn't appear and kill Col. Custer and his company of men. THAT didn't happened. Nor did Satan do it. Nor did aliens. My great great great grandmother was not killed there either. And on and on and on I could go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once I switch to making a positive or affirmative case for what did happen at Custer's last stand I am on different territory. There is a great amount of debate about it and the cases made seem reasonable. It's hard to know what exactly did happen. But it's easy to know what did not happen. We do it all of the time. Christians are in the position of arguing what happened in the Bible, repeatedly, over and over. They must also argue that of the many different historically conditioned understandings of these texts theirs is the correct one. Coupled with the extraordinary claims found in the Bible that are similar to the ones we read in other ancient cultures--claims we deny when others make them--I can easily deny the case Christians make much as I can deny the case that Mormon's make.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3124594900721457470?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view_media/33183/Highlighting_Plumes"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/10/enceladus_afterburner.jpg" alt="enceladus_afterburner" title="enceladus_afterburner" width="441" height="441"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick! It’s trying to get away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought (well, my &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; first thought was that this is Enceladus on full afterburners) was that this was a composite: two images combined. The moon is icy and very bright, while &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/23/enceladus-is-erupting/"&gt;the plumes of water shooting away from cracks in its surface&lt;/a&gt; are faint. But actually, there are two separate light sources here! The face of the Moon we see here is being lit by a full Saturn (think of Saturn as being behind you as you look at the picture). But the Sun is behind Enceladus (not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; behind, but mostly behind and off to the side of the picture), and is illuminating the geysers. That’s why the fainter plumes are visible; we’re looking at the dark side of the moon! If Saturn weren’t lighting it up, the moon would look much darker, and the plumes would be even more visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how the plumes look like a rocket exhaust. With the moon itself just a little offset in the picture, a little above the center, our brains make it look like it’s jetting up, up, and away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry about it actually rocketing into the wild black yonder. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I’ve seen &lt;a href="http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39761/1/06-1235.pdf"&gt;various estimates&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of water erupting away in the plumes, but a reasonable amount is about 250 kg/sec, or a ton of water every 4 seconds. That may sound like a lot, but a ton of water is only a cubic meter&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enceladus has a mass of about 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg, or 400 &lt;em&gt;quadrillion&lt;/em&gt; times the mass it loses from the geysers per second! So even though this picture looks dramatic, the amount of mass Enceladus is losing is actually, and almost literally, a drop in the bucket… but still, enough &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/26/seasons-e-rings/"&gt;to resupply the ice particles in Saturn’s diffuse E-ring&lt;/a&gt;. Amazing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; And while some of the material does escape into space, acting like an extremely weak rocket, a lot of it falls back onto the surface of Enceladus. Those particles can’t move the moon, any more than pulling up on your shoes can make you fly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Fascinating, scary stuff. Those in the UK can probably catch it on the BBC’s iPlayer, but TreVelocita has put it on YouTube for everyone else in 4 parts (the rest are embedded after the jump).&lt;/p&gt;

But I am sincerely seeking the best way to make this point clear, so one more quick try.  And I do appreciate the back-and-forth thus far; sometimes frustrating, but certainly very useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask a contemporary scientist why a table is solid, they would give you an explanation that comes down to the properties of the molecules of which it is made, which in turn reflect a combination of the size of the atoms as determined by quantum mechanics, and the electrostatic interaction between those atoms.  If you were to ask why the Sun shines, you would get a story in terms of protons and neutrons fusing and releasing energy.  If you were to ask what happens when a person flexes a muscle, you would hear about signals sent through nerves by the transmission of ions across electromagnetic potentials and various chemical interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on with innumerable other questions about how everyday phenomena work.  In every single case, the basic underlying story (if that happens to be what you’re interested in, and again there are plenty of other interesting things out there) would involve the particles of the Standard Model, interacting through electromagnetism, gravity, and the nuclear forces, according to the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, you would not have heard that story, because it hadn’t yet been put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But — here’s the important part — one thousand years from now, you will still hear precisely that same story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be new layers underneath, but it won’t be necessary to refer to them to give a sufficient answer to the original question.  There will certainly be much greater understanding of the collective behavior of these underlying particles and forces, which is where most of the great work in modern science is being done.  And hopefully there will be a deeper story about why we have the laws we do, how gravity and quantum mechanics play together, how best to interpret quantum mechanics, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What there won’t be is some dramatic paradigm shift that says “Oops, sorry about those electrons and protons and neutrons, we found that they don’t really exist.  Now it’s zylbots all the way down.”  Nor will we have discovered new fundamental particles and forces that are crucial to telling the story of everyday phenomena.  If those existed, we would have found them by now.  The view of electrons and protons and neutrons interacting through the Standard Model and gravity will stay with us forever — added to and better understood, but never replaced or drastically modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to say something controversial.  I think it is pretty unambiguously correct, once I actually say it clearly.  But it’s something I think is not as widely appreciated as it really should be.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t want to dissect it &lt;em&gt;in extenso&lt;/em&gt;, but I’ll call it to your attention. Matthew Reisz, a features writer for the &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, has written “&lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=413553"&gt;The Dogma Delusion&lt;/a&gt;,” a long analysis of the science-faith “war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s wearingly familiar, and pretty much biased against atheists.  While a few token atheists appear, like Peter Atkins and Steven Weinberg, Reisz quickly shoots them down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You clearly can be a scientist and have religious beliefs,” Peter Atkins, professor of chemistry at the University of Oxford, once conceded. “But I don’t think you can be a real scientist in the deepest sense of the word because they are such alien categories of knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view would, of course, demote Isaac Newton, to name but one, from the ranks of “real scientists”. Is such a “conflict model” either accurate or helpful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reiz devotes far more space to the lucubrations of Elaine Ecklund (reprinting without criticism &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/ecklund-is-framing-again/"&gt;her misleading take on her own survey data&lt;/a&gt;), David Wilkinson, a religious physicist at Durham University, and Karl Giberson of &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt;, who gets the lion’s share of the space and comments.  Atheists are decried again for their theological ignorance.  Reisz even raises the charge of scientism (“But is it really the job of chemists to pronounce on whether love exists, or any wonder that such ‘scientism’ alienates many readers?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of Reisz’s “analysis” can be roughly seen by these two paragraphs, meant to underscore the importance of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, many people devote their lives to scientific work but still find – more or less comfortable – ways of combining [their science] with their religious beliefs and practices. Yet this also implies something else. “Arik”  [an atheist physicist in a U.S. university] may despise religion, but by the sheer law of averages, progress within his discipline, and probably within his department, depends on collaboration between religious, agnostic and atheist scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and religion also seem to have rubbed along well during one of the golden ages of scientific discovery. Peter Harrison is Andreas Idreos professor of science and religion at the University of Oxford. Much of his research has focused on the 17th century, when, he says, “virtually all the key natural philosophers (early scientists) were religious believers. Some were clearly motivated by religious considerations – notably Johannes Kepler and Robert Boyle – although different individuals had different motivations. Most, however, thought that religious beliefs were consistent with their scientific findings, and indeed that religious beliefs and science were mutually reinforcing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Reisz—&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/should-science-and-faith-have-a-chat/"&gt;as did Ecklund in a recent piece&lt;/a&gt;—calls for a greater presence of religion in “secular” college campuses, enabling everyone to study theology so that we can have a “wider conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Ed &lt;/em&gt;sees this as an opinion piece or a news piece, but it’s certainly not the latter.  It’s terribly biased towards accommodationists, and quotes atheists only so their ideas can be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of these types of articles is increasing, and believe me, it’s no fun to do exegesis on the same old arguments.  But I think we need to keep them on our radar screen, for, as accommodationists always emphasize, we need to know the quirks and wiles of our opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve always liked the idea of watches, but we haven’t worn one in a long time, because our cell phones tell time and wake us up every morning. But these &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/wewood-precision-watches-made-from-reclaimed-wood/"&gt;environmentally-conscious watches&lt;/a&gt; from an Italian company called &lt;a href="http://we-wood.us/"&gt;WeWood&lt;/a&gt; changed all that in a nanosecond. The company, now based in L.A., transforms disused wooden flooring (maple, ebony, and other types) into the coolest, most beautiful watches we’ve seen in a long time. State-of-the-art movements, yes, but nothing artificial or toxic here. (Have you ever &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; considered how environmentally unfriendly leather, plastic, and metal watches are? Neither have we, until now.) And the good deed gets better: For every WeWood timepiece you buy, they partner with nonprofit conservation organization American Forests to plant one tree in urban and forested areas around the U.S. and the world. All for $119, which is how much each WeWood watch costs. Sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On September 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/pastafariansatusc/"&gt;Pastafarians at USC&lt;/a&gt; hosted our first huge fundraiser: Stone-A-Heathen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partnered with Amnesty International and raised money to fight stoning in Iran and other countries where stoning still unfortunately exists. The idea was that to ‘stone’ a heathen, one could purchase a water balloon (for a mere dollar!) to throw at the Pastafarian of their choice. The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/01/ugatheists-celebrate-stone-a-heathen-day/"&gt;UGAtheists proved last month&lt;/a&gt; that this could be successful and fun as a publicity stunt, but we were curious (and a bit scared) to see how well it would work as a fundraiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178856691_1001040315_31358703_1672175_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178856691_1001040315_31358703_1672175_n.jpg" alt="" title="62468_1516178856691_1001040315_31358703_1672175_n" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some interesting problems in our quest to hold our event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, we had to convince our campus organizers to let us host it in the first place. (“Stone-A-Heathen” is admittedly a very odd name for a fundraiser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we wanted to use Bible verses. We wanted to make a statement about how Abrahamic religions are the basis for stoning (it’s most prominently mentioned in &lt;a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/lev/20.html"&gt;Leviticus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A18-21&amp;amp;version=KJV"&gt;Deuteronomy&lt;/a&gt; in the Old Testament/Torah). We were told we could not do this — not that we couldn’t make the statement, but that we couldn’t use the verses at all because they could be considered disrespectful, especially if water balloons were thrown at the verses on our backdrop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understood where organizers were coming from, so we asked if we could still have signs with Bible verses on them as long as there were no water balloons being thrown at them. This was acceptable.  We could have been more irritated about the fact that we weren’t allowed to throw water balloons at the Bible verses — on Blasphemy Rights’ Day — but the fact that we were able to use them at all was appreciated. We love our university and the campus organizers are wonderful to work with; we didn’t want to piss them off.  (After all, we do want to hold events with their support in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/61766_471377083124_735808124_6684118_1939967_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/61766_471377083124_735808124_6684118_1939967_n.jpg" alt="" title="StoneAHeathen" width="500" height="667"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the weather.  We nearly cancelled the event!  The weather has been terrible the last few days — cold, rainy, overcast — not good for throwing water balloons (or getting soaked with them).  We were prepared to go through with it, though; we had wetsuits!  We considered canceling early and rescheduling for next week if the weather became horrible, but thankfully, due to divine intervention (joke!), the weather was just as perfect as it could be. It was over eighty degrees and sunny for the three hours we were out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were not as keen as we had hoped to stone us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178816690_1001040315_31358702_4077629_n1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178816690_1001040315_31358702_4077629_n1.jpg" alt="" title="62468_1516178816690_1001040315_31358702_4077629_n" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of them perhaps felt like we were mocking them (we are the Pastafarians, so I understand this), but we barely mentioned scripture.  We asked them if they wanted to donate a dollar towards Amnesty and in doing so they could get a water balloon and “stone” us. The odd thing about this was how many people claimed to be Christian and that it was “against their religion” to stone people. I couldn’t help but listen to what they were saying while glancing at the Leviticus verse on my sign. I know that the Pew survey shows that &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/27/how-ignorant-about-religion-are-religious-americans/"&gt;people don’t know their own religion&lt;/a&gt;, but this was just dumbfounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of people who looked curiously at our signs and laughed. A lot of people donated but didn’t like the idea of correlating a fun event like this to the seriousness of actual stoning. They felt like we were trivializing the pain and brutality of lapidation. I understand where these people are coming from, but we felt that raising awareness and funds was worth them being offended. There are people on my campus who don’t know stoning still takes place. To raise their awareness is worth the slight discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really made this event worthwhile was the fun we had doing it.  I don’t know that we’ve ever had as many people from the Pastafarians out on Greene Street tabling and raising awareness. We had at least twelve members come out to work the event, plus several others who came in support!  We laughed, generated a lot of buzz, called people out, and just had a genuinely good time. Even our university mascot — Cocky the Gamecock (really) — came out and ‘stoned-a-heathen’! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178776689_1001040315_31358701_2747055_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/62468_1516178776689_1001040315_31358701_2747055_n.jpg" alt="" title="62468_1516178776689_1001040315_31358701_2747055_n" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International was also a great group of people. They were so nice and came out to table with us. It’s not always easy to find an organization willing to work with a non-theist organization, but they were great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that fun and insanity cost us $8 for balloons. Meanwhile, we raised $140 for Amnesty International! We hope to see other campuses doing it next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Just for future reference, it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to find water balloons in September. Harder than we expected, anyway. Also, filling up water balloons in the mens’ bathroom is far too entertaining of an experience.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reference to subluxations in medical literature is often presented as support for the practice of chiropractic as a method of adjusting vertebral subluxations to “restore and maintain health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of the public, the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory has confused the definition of the word “subluxation,” a common medical term. Unlike the mysterious, undetectable and asymptomatic chiropractic “vertebral subluxation complex” alleged to be a cause of disease, a real vertebral subluxation, that is, an orthopedic subluxation, can be a cause of mechanical and neuromusculoskeletal symptoms but has never been associated with organic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Subluxations: Real and Imaginary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An orthopedic subluxation, recognized and named as such since the days of Hippocrates, is a painful partial dislocation. Simple misalignment of a vertebra, also referred to as a “subluxation,” is commonly caused by disc degeneration, curvatures, spondylolysis, and structural abnormalities. Such a subluxation may or may not be mechanically symptomatic and can be seen on a plain x-ray image. In the absence of pathology such as disc herniation or osteophyte formation, these common vertebral subluxations or misalignments rarely affect spinal nerves and have never been associated with organic disease. Spinal nerves supply musculoskeletal structures. The body’s organs are supplied primarily by autonomic nerve ganglia and plexuses located outside the spinal column and by cranial and sacral nerves that pass through solid bony openings, providing overlapping nerve supply independent of any one spinal nerve that passes between two vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An orthopedic subluxation, a true vertebral misalignment, or a mechanical joint dysfunction that affects mobility in the spine is not the same as a “chiropractic subluxation” that is alleged to cause disease by interfering with nerve supply to organs. Such a subluxation has never been proven to exist. There is no plausible theory and no credible evidence to support the contention that “nerve interference” originating in a single spinal segment can cause an organic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to provide evidence that commonly occurring vertebral misalignment can cause organic disease, advocates of the subluxation theory have reasoned that there must be some other type of joint dysfunction that can affect general health. They have chosen, by consensus, to call this undetectable lesion a “vertebral subluxation complex,” which “embraces the holistic nature of the human body, including health, well-being, and the doctor/patient relationship as well as the changes in nerve, muscle, connective, and vascular tissues which are understood to accompany the kinesiologic aberrations of spinal articulations.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chiropractors claim to be able to locate these elusive subluxations by using surface electromyography, thermography, vibratory instruments, leg length checks, or by palpating the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A largely ignored landmark review of the literature by a Ph.D. and a chiropractor (Nansel and Szlazak), published in 1995, concluded that there is not a single appropriately controlled study to indicate that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; dysfunction in structures of the spinal column is a cause of organic disease.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The review noted that pain and other symptoms referred from a spinal segment can “create overt signs and symptoms that can &lt;em&gt;mimic&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;simulate&lt;/em&gt; (rather than cause), internal organ disease,” lending no support to the vertebral subluxation theory. Spinal nerves are commonly irritated or compressed, causing pain and other symptoms in the musculoskeletal structures supplied by the affected nerve. But even the most severe compression of a spinal nerve does not cause organic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of the current evidence on the epidemiology of the subluxation construct (Mirtz, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, 2009) also failed to find any credible evidence supporting the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory. This paper, authored by three chiropractors and a Ph.D., concluded that “No supportive evidence is found for the chiropractic subluxation being associated with any disease process or of creating suboptimal health conditions requiring intervention. Regardless of popular appeal this leaves the subluxation construct in the realm of unsupported speculation. This lack of supportive evidence suggests the subluxation construct has no valid clinical applicability.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is justification for use of the word “subluxation” when referring to a mechanical-type spinal problem, there appears to be no justification whatsoever for suggesting that a “chiropractic subluxation” can affect general health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;A Chiropractic Subluxation by Any Other Name…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the chiropractic profession dumped the subluxation theory and took the steps needed to become a physical-treatment specialty in the care of mechanical-type neck and back problems, it could remain open to future research that might reveal evidence that spinal manipulation benefits general health─a finding that would be a bonus for use of manual therapy. Until then, the theory that adjusting a “vertebral subluxation complex” will restore and maintain health is too implausible to warrant support by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the chiropractic profession in the United States continues to be defined by subluxation theory. Too few chiropractors are willing to “step out of line” and announce that the theory (more accurately defined as a belief) is scientifically indefensible and should be dumped. Failure of chiropractic associations to publicly disagree with subluxationists who identify chiropractic as a method of adjusting the vertebral subluxation complex keeps chiropractic marginalized and subject to ridicule by the scientific community. Without some identifying label or degree that distinguishes science-based chiropractors from subluxation-based chiropractors, medical physicians will continue to be reluctant to refer a patient to a chiropractor, lest they deliver a patient into the hands of a pseudoscientific practitioner whose philosophy embraces an anti-medical approach and endangers the patient. Science-based chiropractors who are properly specialized should openly announce their limitations if they are to earn the recognition and trust of medical professionals who can provide the referrals needed to sustain a specialized practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of 2010, the British General Chiropractic Council (GCC) advised members of the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) that “The chiropractic Vertebral Subluxation Complex…is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease or health concerns.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Chiropractors were advised to provide evidence-based care that “incorporates the best available evidence from research, the preferences of the patient and the expertise of practitioners including the individual &lt;em&gt;chiropractor her/himself&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In response, the British Chiropractic Association advised its members to “refrain from making any reference to Vertebral Subluxation Complex in media to which their patients or the general public may have access,” adding that “this advice has no bearing on scope of practice.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the action of the GCC and the BCA in avoiding reference to the Vertebral Subluxation Complex is an important and unprecedented move in the right direction, it appears that the door was left open for British chiropractors to continue treating a broad scope of health problems. Such leniency would not restrict use of a variety of unproven treatment methods (originally based on the vertebral subluxation theory) promoted by individual chiropractors and preferred by indoctrinated patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many chiropractors are now backing away from the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory, many continue to use the theory to justify treating a broad scope of health problems by “adjusting” the spine. They simply point to legal and dictionary definitions of chiropractic to support their claims. Some who do not use the word “subluxation” simply substitute another word or words, such as “joint dysfunction,” in support of their belief that some kind of segmental spinal “lesion” can affect overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Spinal Manipulation Stigmatized by Subluxation Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic definition of chiropractic provides opportunity for pseudoscientific spinal manipulators who treat a broad scope of health problems with a myriad of implausible and unproven treatment methods, alienating an informed public along with the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in 2005, the percentage of the US population seeing chiropractors annually for various reasons decreased from 9.9% in 1997 to 7.4% in 2002.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Using data from a 2002 National Health Interview Survey, a study published in a 2010 issue of &lt;cite&gt;The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine&lt;/cite&gt; reported that about 6% of the US population used complementary alternative medicine (CAM) to treat their back pain. About 74% of this 6% (about 4.4% of the population) went to chiropractors; 22% went to massage therapists.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since conventional medical practitioners traditionally refer back-pain patients to physical therapists, physiatrists, or orthopedic surgeons, physician referral to CAM practitioners remains low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiropractic profession would be well advised to make the changes needed for recognition as specialists in the care of mechanical-type back pain, “the second leading reason for ambulatory office visits” and the most common reason for use of CAM in the United States.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science-based chiropractors who do not subscribe to the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory, who specialize in the use of manipulation and other physical treatment methods in the care of mechanical-type neck and back problems, will use manipulation more appropriately. Unfortunately, there is no recognized label, degree, or association that distinguishes such chiropractors from subluxation-based chiropractors. Without a clear choice in selecting a good chiropractor, few physicians will risk referring their patients to a chiropractor, making survival difficult for properly specialized chiropractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sir James Frazer wrote in 1922, “The ablest man is dragged down by the weakest and dullest, who necessarily sets the standard, since he cannot rise, while the other can fall.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Belief System Perpetuates Status Quo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my graduation from a chiropractic college in 1956, arguments and opinions about chiropractic have changed very little. No one seems to know what chiropractic is or what it does. No two chiropractors can agree on how to treat a specific ailment or which vertebrae to adjust. There are at least 97 named antithetical adjustive techniques,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; all based on a nonsensical, nonfalsifiable chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory. The chiropractic profession as a whole has yet to be properly defined and specialized so that diagnosis and treatment methods are uniformly consistent and interchangeable among chiropractors. Subluxation-based chiropractic continues to be at odds with mainstream health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the public generally thinks of a chiropractor as a “back doctor,” societal suspicion keeps utilization of chiropractic low. In a cycle perpetuated by the definition of chiropractic, science takes a back seat to standards that allow some chiropractors to follow a 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century philosophy formulated by a magnetic healer 115 years ago. So far, the chiropractic profession has failed to take a stand and draw a line that separates sense from nonsense in chiropractic care, keeping the profession on the fringe of health care and in the realm of alternative medicine. The Chiropractic Paradigm formulated by the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC), representing North American Chiropractic Colleges, proposes that “Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health and focuses particular attention on the subluxation.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The purpose of chiropractic is to “optimize health.” This vague and untestable ACC paradigm has been endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association, the International Chiropractic Association, and the World Federation of Chiropractic. The ACC notes that “Because of the emphasis on holistic health care, chiropractic is associated with the field of &lt;strong&gt;complementary and alternative medicine&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until chiropractic schools and associations draw a line (with the fanfare of a clarion call) and take a stand on the side of science as a properly limited specialty, uniformly defining and limiting chiropractic in state laws, the credibility and the status of chiropractors will remain low. Physicians will continue to refer their patients to physical therapists, physiatrists, and orthopedic surgeons rather than risk a bad outcome with inappropriate treatment provided by a chiropractor. With an increasing number of physical therapists and orthopedic manual therapists now including spinal manipulation in their treatment armamentarium, it may eventually become unnecessary to search for the manipulative services of individual science-based chiropractors who are “not like the other chiropractors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that subluxation-based chiropractic, like homeopathy and other belief systems, will be perpetuated to some degree by true believers. It remains to be seen whether chiropractic will eventually split into two camps─one for science-based chiropractors and one for subluxation-based chiropractors. Hopefully, the science-based camp will eventually prevail as a majority in defining chiropractic in state laws, forcing subluxation-based chiropractors to practice surreptitiously. This may never happen. But in the archives of science, the “chiropractic subluxation” will be filed away under the label of dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Nonfalsifiable Subluxation Theory Still Alive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the general consensus of scientific and academic groups that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory is not a viable construct, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners continues to define chiropractic as subluxation-based: “The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the &lt;em&gt;chiropractic subluxation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;joint dysfunction&lt;/em&gt;. A subluxation is a health concern that manifests in the skeletal joints, and, through complex anatomical and physiological relationships, affects the nervous system and may lead to reduced function, disability, or illness.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a definition continues to allow routine manipulation of vertebrae anywhere in the spine to “restore and maintain health” by correcting “subluxations” or “joint dysfunction.” This approach allows frequent manipulation of the cervical spine, a treatment that has been associated with stroke caused by dissection of vertebrobasilar arteries. It’s important to remember that the chances of injury are multiplied when chiropractic neck manipulation is routinely used many times on every patient in a misguided attempt to improve health, as opposed to occasional use of neck manipulation by physical therapists and other manual therapists who are concerned only about restoring mobility in a stiff spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June of 2010, the Connecticut Chiropractic Board, denying that neck manipulation can be a cause of stroke, issued this statement: “After a careful and thorough review of all the testimony and documentary evidence admitted at the hearing [January 2010], the Board concludes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that a stroke or a cervical arterial dissection is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a risk or side effect of joint mobilization, manipulation or adjustment of the cervical spine.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seems unlikely that any group or organization outside of chiropractic will agree with this observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of apparent concerns that chiropractic neck manipulation based on subluxation theory involves more risk than benefit, the Kaiser Permanente Mid Atlantic States and Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group recently revised their Chiropractic Manipulation Medical Coverage Policy to exclude cervical Chiropractic Manipulative Treatment (CMT). The revised policy states: “Given the paucity of data related to beneficial effects of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine and the real potential for catastrophic adverse effects, it was decided to exclude chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine from coverage.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In response, the American Chiropractic Association “…sent a letter to Kaiser outlining the extensive data that supports cervical spine manipulation as both beneficial and safe.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note14"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the schools and associations of the chiropractic profession totally abandon the vertebral subluxation theory, and state and federal laws defining chiropractic are changed, it is not difficult to understand why there might be some justification for blanket condemnation of chiropractic, despite evidence that spinal manipulation can be useful in the treatment of uncomplicated mechanical-type back problems. It does not appear, however, that the chiropractic profession might be willing to voluntarily reduce its scope of practice by renouncing the vertebral subluxation theory. At the present time, “…the 50 state chiropractic practice acts essentially define chiropractic as the detection and correction of subluxations and assume their significance to human health, allowing a broad scope of practice. Because the chiropractic profession seems unwilling to abandon these discredited concepts, reform of the state chiropractic practice acts to eliminate subluxation-based chiropractic practice may be the only viable solution to the perpetration of unscientific and unproved healthcare practices.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note15"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subluxation is the yoke of the chiropractic profession. The “chiropractic subluxation,” under one name or another, continues to find shelter under the umbrella of chiropractic. Good science-based chiropractors who do not subscribe to the vertebral subluxation theory and who use manipulation appropriately can offer a service of value. Unfortunately, such chiropractors are not easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;

It's true that I think he was the greatest scientist who ever lived, but science has moved on since 1859. Modern scientists respect, but do not worship, the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a couple of other problems with the lyrics. I'm confused about the reference to "theory" as some kind of "abstraction" and I don't like the implication that we go back and read Darwin to refresh our memory about modern evolutionary theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also don't like the simplistic explanation of how real science is done. It's a common myth that publishing a peer-reviewed paper is the only way to do science. There are two things wrong with this mythology. First are the obvious exceptions, &lt;i&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt; being one of them. Second, there's plenty of bad science papers in the peer-reviewed literature.

&lt;p&gt;In order to fix this "feature" here's what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run gconf-editor (enter that phrase into a terminal).  Find apps, then metacity, then general, then within that find "button_layout".  Double click on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will say "close,minimize,maximize:menu"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change that to "menu:minimize,maximize,close" and click OK.  Instantly, you will be fixed.  &lt;br&gt;

Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke  University and studies the cognition of bonobos at at &lt;a href="http://www.friendsofbonobos.org/"&gt;Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in Congo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523211?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523211"&gt;&lt;img title="51tgh5fPn2L._SS500_" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2010/09/51tgh5fPn2L._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="51tgh5fPn2L._SS500_" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had been spending a fair bit of time studying bonobos at a sanctuary in Congo, so somehow I missed Sara Gruen’s runaway bestseller &lt;em&gt;Water For Elephants&lt;/em&gt;, which is now being made into a movie starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison. But this year I was ready and anxiously awaiting the arrival of &lt;em&gt;Ape House&lt;/em&gt;, Gruen’s new novel, and one of the few works of fiction ever written about bonobos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a novel about bonobos is like trying to write about unicorns – most people don’t know they exist. However, unlike unicorns, bonobos are very real. They are our closest living relatives, along with chimpanzees, and share 98.7% of our DNA. But while chimpanzees are male dominated and occasionally beat their females and kill each other, bonobos are female dominated and their society has relatively little violence.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest accomplishment of &lt;em&gt;Ape House&lt;/em&gt; is that it brings bonobos to life. The writing is effortless, as though Gruen sat down and wrote the book in one breezy afternoon. But don’t be deceived. The amount of research that went into accurately portraying these rare, gentle apes is enormous. Gruen places her apes in a language research institute – and covering the basics of non human language is a task that would intimidate most scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ape House&lt;/em&gt; bonobos are exceptional communicators. Like several real life apes before them, they use American Sign Language in a whole range of novel contexts, providing perhaps our most extensive and intimate experience with the thoughts and emotions of another species. Gruen spent time with the bonobos Kanzi and Panbinisha at the Great Ape Trust in Iowa, and some of her experiences are clearly portrayed in the book (Kanzi is notorious, like &lt;em&gt;Ape House’s&lt;/em&gt; Bonzi, for being very particular about how his coffee is made).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523211?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523211"&gt;&lt;img title="lr nursery b 024" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2010/09/lr-nursery-b-024-300x200.jpg" alt="lr nursery b 024" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ape House&lt;/em&gt; begins with a dramatic kidnapping of the bonobos from their home at the language institute. They eventually turn up as stars in a reality television series, because, wait for it, bonobos have a lot of sex. If you think this is an outlandish idea, think again. I once had an excited documentary producer suggest that we simultaneously film the sanctuary bonobos and a house full of fraternity boys. I think the producer’s exact words were ‘the bonobos will be having sex while the guys are having sex – it’ll be great!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is an important mechanism of bonobo society – it functions as both conflict management and tension relief. If bonobos feel threatened or anxious, usually they have sex. In most cases the sex is not erotic, it’s as casual and friendly as a handshake. Unfortunately, it is probably the reason why no one knows about them. Because of the bonobo handshake, bonobos are rarely featured in documentaries. They are occasionally left off the phylogenetic tree. Even scientists, who should know better, frequently only talk about our one closest living relative, the chimpanzee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruen  admirably portrays the bonobos as being as puzzled at our sexual proclivities as we are with theirs. Frustrated with the lack of sex going on in the bonobo house, the reality television mogul, who is a porn king, orders a blow up doll to be delivered to the ‘Ape House’. The bonobos tenderly cover her with a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a recent study we conducted at Duke University, only 25% of people know bonobos are a great ape, compared to 80% of people who know that chimpanzees are a great ape. After the success of &lt;em&gt;Water For Elephants&lt;/em&gt;, it’s almost a given that &lt;em&gt;Ape House&lt;/em&gt; will be read by thousands of people, bringing bonobos out of the closet into the spotlight, where they belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/promos/celestron-photo-contest-2010"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/celestron_contest_banner.jpg" alt="celestron_contest_banner" title="celestron_contest_banner" width="610" height="191"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are pretty simple. Just like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/13/celestron-astropix-winners-are-up/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, you have to &lt;a href="http://www.celestronimages.com/register.php"&gt;register on the Celestron images website&lt;/a&gt;, read the &lt;a href="http://www.celestronimages.com/contest_rules.php?contest_id=5"&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;, and then enter your picture(s). An important caveat: at least one piece of equipment you use must have Celestron optics. &lt;/p&gt;

I won’t tell you outright what might win and what might not, but like last year, I’m looking for beautiful images, interesting images, out-of-the-ordinary images. For example, the picture to the left won last year because it was such a cool idea – the photographer took a picture of every planet in the solar system (except Earth, and, for you diehards, Pluto) and the Sun all in the same 24 hour period, then put them together in this montage. You can also &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/photos/11-great-astro-pics-winners-celestron-discover-contest/"&gt;check out the other images from last year&lt;/a&gt;, too. They’re all really amazing shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.celestronimages.com/contest.php?contest_id=5&amp;amp;utm_source=Discover&amp;amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CaptureTheUniverse"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/celestron_prizes.jpg" alt="celestron_prizes" title="celestron_prizes" width="590" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest prizes are very nice: a Celestron Nexstar 8SE telescope (retail value: $1199) for the Grand Prize, an Axiom LX31 eyepiece ($399) for the Runner Up, and a 50th Anniversary First Scope ($70) for the Viewers’ Choice picture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest starts TODAY, October 1, 2010 and ends on October 30, 2010. So get out there and start snapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear skies, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

The author states Developing language skills appears to be more important for boys than girls in helping them to develop self-control and, ultimately, succeed in school.Unfortunately I cannot find the original article (citation below) freely available, so all I have to go on is the brief description from the Science Daily piece:The researchers examined data on children as they aged from 1 to 3 and their mothers who participated in the National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study. As with previous research, Vallotton and Ayoub found that language skills -- specifically the building of vocabulary -- help children regulate their emotions and behavior and that boys lag behind girls in both language skills and self-regulation.What was surprising, Vallotton said, was that language skills seemed so much more important to the regulation of boys&amp;#39; behavior. While girls overall seemed to have a more natural ability to control themselves and focus, boys with a strong vocabulary showed a dramatic increase in this ability to self-regulate -- even doing as well in this regard as girls with a strong vocabulary (emphasis added).I cannot speak directly to the methodology without access to the original article. My guess is that there was some attempt to qualitatively correlate scores on vocabulary tests to either records of bad behavior or observed behavior. I could be wrong. But I&amp;#39;m skeptical about the claims in Science Daily because it strikes me as the sort of thing that would take years of studying and dozens of researchers to come to any definite conclusions about. Yet we have just this one study. It also draws a causal connection between a language skill (vocabulary) and a non-language behavior (emotion and &amp;quot;self-regulation&amp;quot;). It is extremely difficult, under even the best circumstances, to do that. And even when this is done, there are typically teams of neuroscientists using fMRIs and such involved. I mean no disrespect to the authors of the study. They are both accomplished professors of psychology, a very important and challenging field. But they are not, as far as I can tell, either neuroscientists or psycholinguists. The second author, Catherine Ayoub, appears to have a specialty in &amp;quot;Legal mental health issues with children&amp;quot; (see PDF here).This seems to be a case of over-interpretation with the intent of building actionable policy directives. I understand and sympathize with the impulse to translate scientific research into something directly useful that a teacher can implement today. Look, all you have to do is help boys build their vocabulary and they will behave themselves better! Unfortunately, it is rarely wise to make that leap so quickly. I suspect there is no there there.Vallotton, C., &amp;amp; Ayoub, C. (2010).

But I haven’t met her parents yet.  The other day, we had a conversation that went something like this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m running a 5K on Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Sweet! I’ll be there on the sidelines to support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: With signs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: With signs.  [&lt;em&gt;Scribbles: "Congratulations! You just finished a 5K!  No wait, you still have 1.5 miles to go."&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: Hmph. Oh! And my parents are coming, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: So the first time I meet them, you’re not even around…?  Awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: It won’t be too bad, I promise.  Or you can just wear a superhero costume so they don’t see you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: … Or I could run the 5K with you and avoid that whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: Right… do you even know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: I coach Speech Team and write a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;: Umm… I think that means you’re gonna die.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I signed up for the &lt;a href="http://www.bucktown5k.com/"&gt;Bucktown 5K&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no &lt;a href="http://www.c25k.com/"&gt;Couch to 5k&lt;/a&gt; plan that works in two days, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any advice on how I can avoid a hospital stay would be appreciated &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: The registration asked me how fast I run a mile so they can start me in a pack of people my own speed.  I think I just signed up with the senior citizens.  Oh boy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is the test that involves surreptitiously putting a mark on a child&amp;#39;s forehead and then seeing how they react when presented with their mirror image. Attempts by the child to touch or remove the mark are taken as a sign that he or she recognises themselves in the mirror. Studies in the West suggest that around half of all 18-month-olds pass the test, rising to 70 per cent by 24 months. Chimps, orangutans, dolphins and elephants have also been shown to pass the test, and there&amp;#39;s recent debate over whether monkeys can too.

Tanya Broesch and her colleagues began by taking a simplified version of the mirror self-recognition test to Kenya, where they administered it to 82 children aged between 18 to 72 months. This version of the test involved a small, yellow post-it note rather than a red splodge, and children weren&amp;#39;t given the usual verbal prompts such as &amp;#39;who&amp;#39;s that in the mirror?&amp;#39;. Amazingly, just two of the children &amp;#39;passed&amp;#39; the test by touching or removing the post-it note. The other eighty children &amp;#39;froze&amp;#39; when they saw their reflection - that is they stared at themselves but didn&amp;#39;t react to the post-it note. 

Next, Broesch and her team took their test to Fiji, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Peru, Canada and the USA, where they tested 133 children aged between 36 to 55 months. The performance of the North American children was in line with past research, with 88 per cent of the US kids and 77 per cent of the Canadians &amp;#39;passing&amp;#39; the test. Rates of passing in Saint Lucia (58 per cent), Peru (52 per cent) and Grenada (51 per cent) were significantly lower. In Fiji, none of the children &amp;#39;passed&amp;#39; the test. 

So, what&amp;#39;s going on? Are children in these non-Western nations seriously delayed in their mirror self-recognition. The researchers don&amp;#39;t think so. First of all, they deliberately tested a wide age range - in Kenya up to age six - and they think it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely mirror self-recognition could be delayed that far. &amp;#39;Our impression,&amp;#39; the researchers said, &amp;#39;was that they [the children] understood that it was themselves in the mirror, that the mark was unexpected, but that they were unsure of an acceptable response and therefore dared not touch or remove it.&amp;#39;

Inspired in part by past research conducted in Cameroon, in which children who failed the mirror test tended to be the most compliant and obedient, Broesch and her colleagues speculated that the performance in the non-Western, more interdependent cultures may have been affected by the fact that children in these societies are often discouraged from asking questions (they&amp;#39;re expected to learn by watching). &amp;#39;This is in sharp contrast with the independence and self-initiative that tends to be encouraged and nurtured in the Industrial West,&amp;#39; the researchers said. Another factor could be the non-Western children&amp;#39;s relative lack of familiarity with mirrors. 

More research is needed to test the truth of these assertions. Meanwhile, this study provides a compelling example of why we must be cautious when extrapolating from Western psychology research. &amp;#39;Negative results (whether in monkeys or humans) must be examined more closely and results remind us that transporting culture-specific tests among diverse human populations has the potential to lead to flawed interpretations of cognitive differences and developmental processes,&amp;#39; the researchers said.

That's the headline. What's the real story?The research was published in The Lancet, and it's brought to you by Wilson et al from Cardiff University: Rare chromosomal deletions and duplications in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.The authors looked at copy-number variations (CNVs) in 410 children with ADHD, compared to 1156 healthy controls. A CNV is simply a catch-all term for when a large chunk of DNA is either missing ("deletions") or repeated ("duplications"), compared to normal human DNA. CNVs are extremely common - we all have a handful - and recently there's been loads of interest in them as possible causes for psychiatric disorders.What happened? Out of everyone with high quality data available, 15.6% of the ADHD kids had at least one large, rare CNV, compared to 7.5% of the controls. CNVs were especially common in children with ADHD who also suffered mental retardation (defined as having an IQ less than 70) - 36% of this group carried at least one CNV. However, the rate was still elevated in those with normal IQs (11%).A CNV could occur anywhere in the genome, and obviously what it does depends on where it is - which genes are deleted, or duplicated. Some CNVs don't cause any problems, presumably because they don't disrupt any important stuff.The ADHD variants were very likely to affect genes which had been previously linked to either autism, or schizophrenia. In fact, no less than 6 of the ADHD kids carried the same 16p13.11 duplication, which has been found in schizophrenic patients too.So...what does this mean? Well, the news has been full of talking heads only too willing to tell us. Pop-psychologist Oliver James was on top form - by his standards - making a comment which was reasonably sensible, and only involved one error:Only 57 out of the 366 children with ADHD had the genetic variant supposed to be a cause of the illness. That would suggest that other factors are the main cause in the vast majority of cases. Genes hardly explain at all why some kids have ADHD and not others.Well, there was no single genetic variant, there were lots. Plus, unusual CNVs were also carried by 7% of controls, so the "extra" mutations presumably only account for 7-8%. James also accused The Lancet of "massive spin" in describing the findings. While you can see his point, given that James's own output nowadays consists mostly of a Guardian column in which he routinely over/misinterprets papers, this is a bit rich.The authors say thatthe findings allow us to refute the hypothesis that ADHD is purely a social construct, which has important clinical and social implications for affected children and their families.But they've actually proven that "ADHD" is a social construct. Yes, they've found that certain genetic variants are correlated with certain symptoms. Now we know that, say, 16p13.11-duplication-syndrome is a disease, and that its symptoms include (but aren't limited to) attention deficit and hyperactivity. But that doesn't tell us anything about all the other kids who are currently diagnosed with "ADHD", the ones who don't have that mutation."ADHD" is evidently an umbrella term for many different diseases, of which 16p13.11-duplication-syndrome is one. One day, when we know the causes of all cases of attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms, the term "ADHD" will become extinct. There'll just be "X-duplication-syndrome", "Y-deletion-syndrome" and (because it's not all about genes) "Z-exposure-syndrome".When I say that "ADHD" is a social construct, I don't mean that people with ADHD aren't ill. "Cancer" is also a social construct, a catch-all term for hundreds of diseases. The diseases are all too real, but the concept "cancer" is not necessarily a helpful one. It leads people to talk about Finding The Cure for Cancer, for example, which will never happen. A lot of cancers are already curable. One day, they might all be curable. But they'll be different cures.So the fact that some cases of "ADHD" are caused by large rare genetic mutations, doesn't prove that the other cases are genetic. They might or might not be - for one thing, this study only looked at large mutations, affecting at least 500,000 bases. Given that even a deletion or insertion of just one base in the wrong place could completely screw up a gene, these could be just the tip of the iceberg.But the other problem with claiming that this study shows "a genetic basis for ADHD" is that the variants overlapped with the ones that have recently been linked to autism, and schizophrenia. In other words, these genes don't so much cause ADHD, as protect against all kinds of problems, if you have the right variants.If you don't, you might get ADHD, but you might get something else, or nothing, depending on... we don't know. Other genes and the environment, presumably. But  "7% of cases of ADHD associated with mutations that also cause other stuff" wouldn't be a very good headline...N. M. Williams et al (2010).

The idea is that you place a red dot on a baby or animal and then put them in front of a mirror to observe how they react to it. The idea is that if the subject recognizes that they’re looking at their own reflection and start feeling around area on their body that corresponds to where they see the red dot in their reflection, it’s a positive sign that they are self-aware. Human infants of a certain age can figure it out. Chimps can figure it out. And &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/11/mirror_mirror_on_the_wall_whos.php"&gt;so can numerous other species&lt;/a&gt;. But now for the first time, monkeys have demonstrated that they too can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/our_students_arent_children_bu.php"&gt;Blueprints for plot to undermine CNN exposed&lt;/a&gt; – Remember that plot to dishonestly make ACORN look like it supported prostitution? A Republican named James O’Keefe was the one responsible for masterminding it. Now the blueprints to another plot of his have surfaced. And sadly, they make that earlier plot seem like genius in comparison. I’ll give you a hint. It involved a rather implausible and convoluted attempt to seduce CNN’s own Abbie Boudreau after luring her under false pretenses onto his boat, which would be filled with sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;

If we’re able to find another Earth-like planet only 20 light years away, it stands to reason that such worlds might not be as uncommon as we once originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;

But the website Age of Autism has just listed some of their book tour itinerary and I found something rather curious. Just when I was getting a little excited to help organize some kind of rally to counter their claims on the day of their inevitable Manahattan stop, I noticed that they aren’t coming to Manhattan. Tomorrow (Friday) and Saturday they will be in Mt. Kisco, NY and Yonkers, NY respectively. But no NYC stops are listed. New York and L.A. are the two stops that every book tour is usually guaranteed to hit. And yet the anti-vaxxers aren’t coming to NYC? What?! That doesn’t make any sense. But in any event, it doesn’t bode well for their already dismally selling book.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the coroner's report, the cause of death was rampant overuse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The genre began its slow decline two years ago, when &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/377007/"&gt;Gawker&lt;/a&gt; reported the death of the semicolon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Semicolon died this week at the age of 417 from complications of  irrelevancy and misuse. Semicolon was born in England in 1591 to Ben  Jonson, the first notable writer to use them &amp;quot;systematically.&amp;quot; The mark  of punctuation dedicated its career to connecting independent clauses  and indicating a closer relationship between the clauses than a period  does. But mostly it just confused the shit out of English students  everywhere. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semicolon is survived by colon, parenthesis and em dash. In lieu of  flowers, please send anecdotes of times you have been confused by a  semicolon to Farrar, Straus and Giroux, care of Jonathan Franzen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more serious assault befell the genre on September 19th, when &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;columnist &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/13/AR2010091304476.html"&gt;Gene Weingarten&lt;/a&gt; declared the sad end of the whole English language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English language, which arose from humble Anglo-Saxon roots to  become the lingua franca of 600 million people worldwide and the  dominant lexicon of international discourse, is dead. It succumbed last  month at the age of 1,617 after a long illness. It is survived by an  ignominiously diminished form of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end came quietly on Aug. 21 on the letters page of The Washington  Post. A reader castigated the newspaper for having written that Sasha  Obama was the "youngest" daughter of the president and first lady,  rather than their "younger" daughter. In so doing, however, the letter  writer called the first couple the "Obama's." This, too, was published,  constituting an illiterate proofreading of an illiterate criticism of an  illiteracy. Moments later, already severely weakened, English died of  shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genre met its maker with a final blow on September 30th, when &lt;a href="http://www.artworldsalon.com/blog/2010/09/%E2%80%9Ccurator%E2%80%9D-rip/"&gt;Artworld Salon&lt;/a&gt; (as discussed on &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/09/word_inflation"&gt;Johnson blog&lt;/a&gt;) posted an obituary for the word "curator":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Curator” R.I.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behold our fall collection,” trumpets the mail order catalog of  Restoration Hardware, the home interiors chain. “No longer mere  ‘retailers’ of home furnishings, we are now ‘curators’ of the best  historical design the world has to offer.” And so another of our words  bites the dust. The word “curator” is becoming overused to the point of  losing its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the mock-obit gimmick was exploited to bemoan the fate of punctuation, words, and the entire language, it had a long, healthy life in other spheres, such as sports, politics, and religion. A high point occurred in 1882, after Australia unexpectedly defeated the powerhouse England in a test cricket series. The magazine &lt;em&gt;Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game &lt;/em&gt;announced the end of England's dominance in the sport:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SACRED TO THE MEMORY&lt;br&gt;
OF&lt;br&gt;
ENGLAND'S SUPREMACY IN THE&lt;br&gt;
CRICKET-FIELD&lt;br&gt;
WHICH EXPIRED&lt;br&gt;
ON THE 29TH DAY OF AUGUST, AT THE OVAL&lt;br&gt;
"ITS END WAS PEATE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, &lt;em&gt;The Sporting Times&lt;/em&gt; followed suit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Affectionate Remembrance&lt;br&gt;
of&lt;br&gt;
ENGLISH CRICKET,&lt;br&gt;
which died at the Oval&lt;br&gt;
on&lt;br&gt;
29th AUGUST 1882,&lt;br&gt;
Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing&lt;br&gt;
friends and acquaintances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.I.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.B.—The body will be cremated and the&lt;br&gt;
ashes taken to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then on, the England-Australia cricket series would be known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt; (complete with an &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/6052544.stm"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt;). British journalists occasionally mourned the death of other sports, as when &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lmK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA30"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; wrote in 1914, "In loving memory of British Rowing, which passed away at Henley on Saturday July 4th. Deeply lamented by many sorrowing followers." (Harvard won the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Challenge_Cup"&gt;Grand Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; that year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,885290,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, whose publisher Henry Luce was no fan of FDR, drafted a mock obit for the New Deal in 1944:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death Revealed. The New Deal, 10, after long illness; of malnutrition and desuetude. Child of the 1932 election campaign, the New Deal had four healthy years, began to suffer from spots before the eyes in 1937, and never recovered from the shock of war. Last week its father, Franklin Roosevelt, pronounced it dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838436,00.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recounted a more Nietzschean death notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Satirist Anthony Towne tried to resolve the theological debate over whether God is dead by publishing an obituary of the Deity. The deadpan story was turned down by a number of journals, but finally appeared in the Christian student magazine Motive under the New York Times-like headline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOD IS DEAD IN GEORGIA&lt;br&gt;
Eminent Deity Succumbs During Surgery—Succession in Doubt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towne followed up the obituary with a whole book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/ktblog/the-diaries-of-the-late-god/"&gt;Excerpts from the Diaries of the Late God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Now &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; commitment to a genre. Will we soon be seeing the Diaries of the Late English Language? And what language will it be written in?&lt;/p&gt;

Come on, you know you want it. If we're lucky, maybe Jake Crosby or even Dr. Jay will come out and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant writing has that effect on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think a video from a most excellent 1980s band sums up the situation when it comes to grant funding these days:&lt;/p&gt;

The movie tells how the military manipulated Pat’s death and used it as war propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You rarely hear about Pat’s atheism in the mainstream media, but Pat never shied away from it.  Richard shares those beliefs and he held nothing back during his interview with Maher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part really begins at the 5:30 mark.&lt;/p&gt;

L. Mencken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to gain instant acceptance as a black “leader” these days is to shove the word &lt;em&gt;Reverend&lt;/em&gt; in front of your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are really greedy and ambitious, the word &lt;em&gt;Bishop&lt;/em&gt;. Bishop Eddie Long of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia preaches that Bayard Rustin was a vile sinner who suffered from the curable “disease” of homosexuality. I have a rule of thumb for such clerics and have never known it to fail: Set your watch and sit back, and pretty soon they will be found sprawling lustily on the floor of the men’s room. It may be a bit early to claim the scalp of Eddie Long for this collection, but I doubt I shall have to withdraw . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day can’t be far off when Long follows the traditional script and starts to yowl for prayer and repentance. And this would all be the greatest fun if it didn’t also involve the degradation of the King family and the steady erosion of the real memory of the civil rights movement, which is not safe when left in the keeping of God’s bigmouths and tree-shakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that Mencken-esque or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amanda and I were outside the cabin in Cass County, Minnesota last week, cutting pieces of plywood for sub flooring, and we saw this creature among the debris.  At first I thought it was some kind of wasp covered with tiny spiders, but on further investigation it turned out to be a beetle covered with mites. When we first saw it, there were many more mites than in this photo, and they were virtually roiling on the insect's surface.  It looked almost as though the insect was foaming.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/09/strange_insect_encounter_carri.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/09/strange_insect_encounter_carri.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/QLGja2buHds" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285899436479"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/what_did_you_do_for_blasphemy.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77509c3b861090cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">What did you do for Blasphemy Day?</title><published>2010-10-01T02:46:30Z</published><updated>2010-10-01T02:46:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/eIPDC8LzkMQ/what_did_you_do_for_blasphemy.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/what_did_you_do_for_blasphemy.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the official &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-10-02-blasphemy-day_N.htm"&gt;Blasphemy Day&lt;/a&gt;, and I hope you all had a good time. I'm afraid I didn't do anything in particular, because &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; day is Blasphemy Day for me, and I'm a walking talking affront to god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/campaign_for_free_expression"&gt;CFI had a video contest&lt;/a&gt; and announced the winners today. Here's the top choice in their Protect Dissent campaign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QtxaeqmONqc?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=264" width="425" height="264"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's very nice, and an excellent message. I'm afraid, though, that it has been upstaged by a real champion: &lt;a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/202328/rh-advocate-carlos-celdran-arrested-for-protesting-inside-cathedral"&gt;Carlos Celdran&lt;/a&gt;. Celdran went all out and disrupted a Catholic mass, holding up a sign that said &amp;quot;DAMASO&amp;quot; (a reference to a cruel priest in a novel well-known in the Philippines), and told the church to stop getting nvolved in politics — the Catholics, as you might expect, have been fighting a basic reproductive health bill in the country. The Philippines have strict anti-blasphemy laws that make &amp;quot;offending religious feelings&amp;quot; a crime, and the church has an unfortunate amount of influence on the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s blasphemy — not just a random act of desecration, but an intentional act directed at discomfiting the faithful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/what_did_you_do_for_blasphemy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eIPDC8LzkMQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285898692391"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/09/get_ready_october_is_campaign.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcd5409f686334c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Get Ready.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CelticBear&lt;/strong&gt;, an atheist, decided to take the course at his wife’s request.  It might sound painful, but he’s been &lt;a href="http://www.celticbear.com/weblog/2010/09/27/how-can-we-have-faith-how-do-we-debate-ideas/"&gt;blogging about each of the ten sessions&lt;/a&gt;, so he has plenty of reason to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The course is called &lt;em&gt;Explore The Meaning of Life: The Alpha Course&lt;/em&gt;. by an English Anglican priest, Nicky Gumbel. Evidently, he’s taken this course, which has been around for decades, and turned it from being an introduction for new Christians into a study for people outside the faith looking to understand more about Christianity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course takes place at his church — they eat food, watch a video, and break up into small groups for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, CelticBear is not very impressed.  Here’s just one of his many rebuttals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… from Nicky, we have this gem: &lt;strong&gt;“Everybody exercises faith all the time. Sitting in those chairs, you have faith they’ll hold you.”&lt;/strong&gt; Name that fallacy: false equivocation. The kind of faith one has in the stability of a chair is not remotely close to the kind of faith needed to believe in an invisible disembodied intelligence that has a personal relationship with humans he blames for their failings despite him being their all-knowing/all-powerful creator. Wee bit different.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else sat through an Alpha Course?  I’m sure your thoughts were similar to CelticBear’s, but what did you think of the course itself? Is it a good primer for atheists? Is it completely a waste of time?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure he’d appreciate hearing from others who have already gone through this!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="http://www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/pdf/HeavyBurdenReport.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heavy Burden: The Individual Costs of Being Overweight and Obese in the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was published last week by professors at the George Washington University School of Public Health. Many have argued that the U.S. obesity epidemic is burdening our health care system, but the researchers behind this study were actually interested in the costs to individuals: Direct medical costs, personal costs (like clothing, transportation, and daily needs), and wages lost due to absenteeism, lower productivity, or even hiring prejudice were all taken into consideration when evaluating the total cost of being overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggest that not only does excess weight lead to excess expense, but when it comes to cost, it also matters &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; excess weight someone has, and whether they’re male or female. They grouped their study subjects by Body Mass Index (BMI), using the standard categories and brackets used in medical literature: normal weight (BMI 18.5 – &amp;lt;25), overweight (BMI 25 – &amp;lt;30), moderately obese (BMI 30 – &amp;lt;35), severely obese (BMI 35 – &amp;lt;40), and morbidly obese (BMI &amp;gt;40). Those with the highest BMIs suffered the greatest additional costs; those in the lowest, the least — as they put in the conclusion of their study: “As individuals move up in the degree of obesity, costs grow exponentially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found a significant difference in cost for males vs. females, with obese women paying nearly double what obese men pay in personal costs. They attributed the difference mostly employer discrimination, citing greater prejudices against obese women than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think the study’s findings seem accurate? Do you think that obesity is necessarily an indication of high health care costs (for individuals or our health care system)? Tell us what you think in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Kody, Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAMN, y’all have a lot of kids! (Oops, are we not supposed to say damn? Sorry, I’ll work on that.) I’m so flattered that y’all are considering me to be Mrs. Brown #5. What an honor! I love watching y’all on &lt;a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/sister-wives/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Wives&lt;/em&gt; on TLC&lt;/a&gt;. So I guess it was fate that y’all just happened to accidentally back into my car with your giant Suburban in the Walmart parking lot. And Kody, it was so cute when you said: “Aw, shoot, we’re sorry. Now, we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; exchange insurance information like everybody does, or we could all just marry you instead!” (Seriously, though, have y’all submitted that insurance paperwork yet?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I didn’t grow up in a polygamist household. My whole life, I’ve dreamed of being married to just one man — and four other ladies. See, my upbringing was very strange and dysfunctional: My parents were only ever married to each other. And they didn’t have, like, 37 children. They only had two. Throughout their marriage, my parents lived in the same house and slept in the same bed. My father didn’t sleep with my mother every third or fourth night, and retire to the bedrooms of his other wives on the other nights. You can see how this type of arrangement would have been extremely traumatic for a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why wife #5 sounds like the perfect job for me. See, I’m not ambitious or competitive. I’m actually really lazy. I’ve never wanted to be #1, #2, #3, or #4 at anything…in school, sports, work, or life. (And it shows…I never have been!) I don’t work outside the home, but I hope that wouldn’t be a problem for y’all. From what I can tell, Kody and Janelle, it seems like you’ve got that angle covered. And y’know, it’s funny, I’m also not really into housework, either (cleaning, laundry, dishes, that sort of thing). But Christine seems like such as expert at all those things, and I’d never want to take that power away from her. I’ve often been told that one of my best qualities is selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I love how all those older teenage kids of yours (what are their names again?) get up every morning at 5 a.m. and make breakfast for all the other kids. That is so wonderful, y’all. Just curious: Could we keep that whole thing going? That way, maybe the older ones could stick around to whip me up some flapjacks or an omelette at around 10-ish. See, I’m really not much of a morning person, and trust me, you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to taste my cooking. (Though I do make great reservations, which is why I was so thrilled when Kody suggested that he and I go to Tortilla Flats for Mexican food. I love that place. But I certainly did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; expect things to get so heated in the back seat of the dented Suburban after dinner! You told your four wives about our third date, right, Kody?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me, as you know, I don’t have any children. And, honestly, I really don’t want any. Does that make me a bad person? I hope not. But, let’s face it, even if I started today, I’d certainly never be able to compete with the rest of y’all in that department! Plus, not to name names, but I’ve seen the way wife #2  has &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; let herself go after pushing out half-a-dozen or so rugrats, and I’d rather that not happen to me. No offense, y’all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One logistical question: Which wing of the house would be mine? I only ask because it seems like things are getting pretty tight in there these days. But not to worry: I have some ideas about an addition that would include a cathedral ceiling, an open-plan kitchen, living room, and dining room with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances (perfect for entertaining, which I like to do a lot…just wait til y’all taste my appletinis on girls’ night!), a media room, and a bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and dual sinks. (Sorry, Kody, but that last one is non-negotiable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more thing. Kody, if this whole thing works out and I’m lucky enough to have y’all choose me to become wife #5, I’ll be more than happy to skip my nights with you anytime (or even all the time), and give them to Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn. No, really. It’s fine. I swear. I think it would mean a lot to my four other sister wives. Like I said, I’m a selfless person. It’s just my nature. (And, don’t forget, I’m also lazy.) Besides, I’ll have my 52-inch flat-screen Sony LCD TV to keep me company, won’t I? (Kody, please forward those specs to the contractor. Thanks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to marry y’all soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much love (but not in a gay way, ladies),&lt;/p&gt;

(My colleague Beth Levin has a much larger and better organized collection.) Some of these are long-established, and not particularly transparent semantically, but all of the patterns can be used to innovate verbs — and often incur peevish displeasure when they are. Why innovate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, in particular, should Language Loggers — well, me and Mark Liberman — have reached for &lt;em&gt;thesaurisize&lt;/em&gt; (my preferred spelling) or &lt;em&gt;thesaurusize&lt;/em&gt; (Mark's) on occasion over the years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general story, told &lt;a href="http://arnoldzwicky.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/brevity-plus/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation and spread of lexical items very often is favored by considerations of &lt;strong&gt;brevity&lt;/strong&gt;: items are invented by some people and adopted by others because they are more compact than earlier expressions. (And for some reasons not having to do with formal considerations: they have the virtue of &lt;strong&gt;novelty&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting fashion, ostentatious cleverness, or playfulness; and they usually have the virtue of &lt;strong&gt;contextual or social specificity&lt;/strong&gt;, via ties to specific contexts, like sports, journalism, business, radio/television, the tech world, gaming, etc., or to specific social groups, like young people, Australians, women, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these innovations also frequently (perhaps almost always) have the virtue of&lt;strong&gt; semantic/pragmatic specificity&lt;/strong&gt;. The innovations usually allow for shadings of meaning that are fuzzed over in the older expressions (which, typically, have radiated and generalized in their meanings over the years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, what are virtues in one person's eyes are ugly defects in another's.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Log story, as far as I've been able to reconstruct it, goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. My first use of &lt;em&gt;thesaurisize&lt;/em&gt;, on 11/17/04 in "Not a word!" (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001652.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), merely conveyed 'search in a thesaurus, use a thesaurus to find near-synonyms':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiske's entry declares sternly that &lt;em&gt;trepidatious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is "solecistic for &lt;em&gt;fearful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (and similar words)"; he offers &lt;em&gt;uneasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;fearful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. A bit of thesaurisizing for the noun &lt;em&gt;trepidation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; provided the following alternatives to &lt;em&gt;trepidatious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;agitated, alarmed, anxious, apprehensive, dismayed, fearful, frightened, hesitant, reluctant, timid, uneasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thesaurisizing&lt;/em&gt; has the virtue of brevity; but the synthetic compound &lt;em&gt;thesaurus-searching&lt;/em&gt; is equally short. Presumably I went for a nominalization of the verb &lt;em&gt;thesaurisize&lt;/em&gt; for its novelty value, though I can't really reconstruct my motivations from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on 10/30/08 in "Periods" (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=779"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), I used &lt;em&gt;thesaurisize&lt;/em&gt; for a more specific sort of thesaurus-searching, namely looking for synonyms to vary the vocabulary in writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the facts of life in teaching is that every field necessarily has its own set of concepts, and terminology to go along with them, and students have to learn that — even though they've been taught to vary their vocabulary and not just keep using the same words over and over again (good advice, but it has its limitations) — there's very little wiggle room with technical terms. Thesaurisizing is a really bad move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other Google hits (not from Language Log) for &lt;em&gt;thesaurisize&lt;/em&gt; in approximately this sense, and apparently even more for &lt;em&gt;thesaurize&lt;/em&gt; in this sense. (The &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt; has no modern cites for either verb, in any of the possible spellings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Liberman entered the thesaurus stakes on 12/6/04, in "Overpermissive quotatives: grammar change or thesaurusizing?" (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001691.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), using &lt;em&gt;thesaurusizing&lt;/em&gt; "to describe the process of replacing words with fancier equivalents in order to impress readers", as he put it in a &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004078.html"&gt;later posting&lt;/a&gt;. Again, a more specific meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this later posting, &amp;quot;Native language? Plagiarism&amp;quot; of 1/22/07, Mark was interested in yet another more specific reading, asking the question, &amp;quot;Is there a word for thesaurus-driven mis-substitution to disguise authorship?&amp;quot; — a species of plagiarism that attempts to cover its tracks by re-wording. Mark collected suggestions, including &lt;em&gt;thesaurism&lt;/em&gt; (also not in the &lt;em&gt;OED&lt;/em&gt;), but casting his own vote for Ran Ari-Gur's lovely neologism &lt;em&gt;text laundering&lt;/em&gt; (parallel to &lt;em&gt;money laundering&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004082.html"&gt;a posting&lt;/a&gt; the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there stands the state of thesaur{i,u}sizing on Language Log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Anadromous fish spend most of their adult life in the ocean returning to freshwater to spawn, the classic example of anadromy is Pacific salmon.  While it is all well and good to say that a fish moves between salt and freshwater the timing and frequency of these movements can have implications on the management of anadromous species.  The goal of tracking migrations between the marine and freshwater environment can be accomplished through traditional mark and recapture studies, however, these lack corresponding age data and fail to provide a complete history of the fishes migrations the way otolith analysis can.  In studies of anadromy, it seems as though the element strontium (Sr) is some sort of miracle element.  Although exceptions do exist Sr is typically more highly concentrated in marine waters than freshwaters (Limburg 1995).  In addition to showing differences between marine and freshwater environments Sr also incorporates into the otolith quite nicely, perhaps becaucuse Sr is similar in size to Ca, and otolith Sr usually reflects Sr in the ambient water (Campana 1999).  If everything stated previously holds true (there is higher concentrations of Sr in saltwater than freshwater, and Sr is incorporated into the otolith in ratios similar to the ambient water) then the pattern of Sr in an otolith should increase and decrease when a fish moves between saltwater and freshwater.  The classic pattern of anadromy can be illustrated by this picture (although this picture may or may not have been for the purpose of investigating anadromy) from Dr. Norman Halden at the Univeristy of ManitobaThe bottom plot shows Sr.  The center, or core, of the otolith, representing growth when the fish was young shows low Sr.  This pattern could be interpreted as the fish was remaining in a low Sr environment (freshwater).  As this fish gets older there are peaks and declines in Sr.  This could be interpreted as the fish moving between salt (peaks) and freshwater (declines).  This pattern is pretty typical of what you would see from an anadromous fish species.  The Sr pattern for a fish that spends its whole life in freshwater would theoretically be relatively flat, without the peaks and declines in Sr.However, there are limitations to this method and the pattern of Sr is not always clear cut, as I am coming to find out with my own data.  Dealing with an anadromous species like river herring I would expect to see a pattern of fluctuating Sr.  River herring are born in freshwater (where you would expect low Sr), then move to the ocean (where you would expect high Sr).  River herring then move between the ocean and freshwater in order to spawn, therefore, I would expect to see low Sr at the core of the otolith and then fluctuations throughout its life.  However, I have not necessarily seen this pattern, and at least in some of the fish I have looked at the pattern appears to be backwards.  I think this is pretty interesting, and am still trying to determine if it is the result of instrument error or some natural phenomenon.Sources Campana, S. (1999).

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I just called the campground this morning. There is a cottage available for rent for the evening! You can book it! You can put a sign on the door that says “No s’mores allowed!” The walls will also serve to protect you from cold temperatures, bugs, and face-eating bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you just say face-eating bears? Holy shit! Will they be there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. They will not. Or… at least they haven’t bought a ticket yet, so we’re not expecting them. Your face will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of dog are you bringing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s a pit bull. I’m going to be in the woods. With bears. I’m not fucking around. I’m bringing a pit bull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is your dog going to kill me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. Unless you’re a bear. And even then, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I bring my dog?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Especially if it’s nice to people and kills bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope you have fun but I’m a student/unemployed/can’t afford the ticket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**We have a free ticket for a woman who would like to go.**&lt;/strong&gt; Please email me at elyse at womenthinkingfree dot org and be all “YOU CAN’T TAKE THE SKY FROM ME!” And we’ll get you to your bunk.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are you so awesome?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awww shucks.

But various other obligations and opportunities have cut into my blogging time, and so for now, I'll just point you to the slides for my own presentation here: Jiahong Yuan and Mark Liberman, "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/is2010a.pdf"&gt;F0 Declination in English and Mandarin Broadcast News Speech&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still hope to blog about some of the other interesting things I've learned here, but it's already time for me to head out on the next leg of my journey. Worse, I've already got a list of things to blog about from the next conference where I'm co-author on a presentation, &lt;a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/events/emnlp2010/"&gt;EMNLP 2010&lt;/a&gt; — which hasn&amp;#39;t even started yet.  At the top of that list is Dmitriy Genzel, Jakob Uszkoreit and Franz Och, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~fosler/emnlp2010-final/pdf/EMNLP016.pdf"&gt;'Poetic' Statistical Machine Translation: Rhyme and Meter&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;As a prerequisite to translation of poetry, we implement the ability to produce translations with meter and rhyme for phrase-based MT, examine whether the hypothesis space of such a system is flexible enough to accomodate such constraints, and investigate the impact of such constraints on translation quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their way of posing and solving the problem is very elegant, and the results are impressive.  In the face of this display of imaginative technical bravado, it's churlish to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can't help observing that their definition of English meter is wrong, in ways that cause their outputs to be both too tightly and too loosely constrained. They set up an ideal pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;[I]f we use 0 to indicate no stress, and 1 to indicate stress, blank verse with iambic foot obeys the regular expression (01)*.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then add costs to translation candidates based on a count of mismatches between the stress sequence of a candidate translation and the desired ideal pattern.  Impressively, their algorithms are flexible enough to accommodate such extra constraints, and their hypothesis space of possible translations is large enough that they can generally find something that fits fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is,  this isn't really how English accentual-syllabic verse works.  The details are complicated and vary with writer, period, and genre. And there are competing theories about how to describe and explain the facts. But the basic descriptive situation for English iambic pentameter is a pattern like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x s w s w s w s w s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the stressed syllables of polysyllabic words are not allowed in w(eak) positions.  There are no (categorical) constraints on the location of monosyllables, and no (categorical) constraint against unstressed syllables in s(trong) positions, and no constraints on the first syllable (so that "inverted feet" are common at line beginnings). There are also issues about when "syllables" can (or must) be ignored for purposes of scansion.  (Some further discussion &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001172.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or more authoritatively and at greater length, &lt;a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/251metrics/Papers/Kiparsky1975StressSyntaxAndMeter.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/linguistics/people/hayes/Papers/HayesProsodicHierarchyInMeter1989.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0024-3841(00)00049-8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see any reason that Genzel, Uzkoreit and Och couldn't modify their system to use the right constraints rather than the wrong ones (though there are a few possible complications due to interactions at the joints of phrasal combinations), and so it's too bad that they didn't set the system up to match the actual norms of English metered verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your added reading pleasure, the authors have reprinted the "&lt;a href="http://research.google.com/archive/papers/review_in_verse.html"&gt;Review  in verse&lt;/a&gt;" that they got from an anonymous referee.  Again, the reviewer's dedication and good spirits are impressive, though the meter is a bit, um, rough in spots.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors sequenced virus from an Indian rhesus macaque experimentally infected with SIVmac239 and coding regions from 11 HIV-positive patients. Overlapping RT-PCR amplicons were used to cover the virus genome sequences, and the RT-PCR-amplified genomes were simultaneously fragmented and tagged using the Nextera Roche 454-Compatible Enzyme Mix, followed by pyrosequencing. An average of 41,826 sequence reads per SIV genome was obtained, with an average coverage depth of 380 sequences. For HIV samples, an average of 29,000 sequence reads per genome with a sequencing depth range of 208-846 was obtained. Full or near-full coverage was obtained with Nextera libraries prepared from 50 ng of DNA.

The authors conclude that, using Nextera technology, they are able to demonstrate:

“...a new and highly practical approach to study the complexity of the viral population within a host and identify minor variants on a genome-wide scale. While this manuscript applies pyrosequencing to immunodeficiency viruses, this approach could be applied to any viral pathogen.”

&lt;p&gt;  That is my latest thought on getting people interested in how the planet is changing.  I was led to it by an article in my local newspaper.  On an isolated farm a few miles from here two men in their sixties tried to kill each other.  One codger survived numerous stab wounds to shoot the other man just once. (Notice to the violently inclined:  Firearms have consistently trumped edge weapons for about six hundred years now.  Keep up or keep cool.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buddhism seems such a nice religion – all about “spiritual development”, not hurting anyone, thinking about the higher things in life, and so on. This nice-guy uniqueness appears to be misplaced, however. Not only do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; religions say they’re concerned with the next world rather than this (which doesn’t stop the Pope wearing Gucci, or Armani or whatever), Buddhism – like all religions – has its dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;, this side of the Rupert Murdoch Times paywall, Katherine Wharton has &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7167161.ece"&gt;a chilling review &lt;/a&gt;of a new book of essays about “Buddhist Warfare”, edited by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer. Like other religions – and of course, ideologies – Buddhism has justified “compassionate torture” (“burning of the remnants of the victim’s past sins”), killing, and even mass murder”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a soldier killed a man he earned the title of first-stage Bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be). The more he killed the more he went up the echelon towards sainthood . . . the insurgents were given an alcoholic drug that made them crazy to the extent that fathers and sons no longer recognized each other and didn’t think twice before killing each other; the only thing that mattered was killing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the writers, Brian Victoria, implicates D. T. Suzuki (1870–1966), “the most influential proponent of Zen to the West in the twentieth century”, in providing the justification for the slaughter of millions of Chinese during the Asia-Pacific war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quotes the ninth-century Chinese monk Yi-hiuan, who urged his hearers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kill everything you encounter, internally as well as externally! Kill the Buddha! Kill your father and mother! Kill your closest friends!”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure Buddhist readers will be shocked, and hasten to let us know that this is not a true representation of their beliefs. I should hope not. But it is true, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When geeks die, they don’t go to heaven, they go to an eternal w00tstock. W00tstock ∞.0, you could call it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really way too much fun. I was on stage at w00tstock &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/07/26/comic-con-3-w00tstock/"&gt;at Comic Con&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year, my first, and I was torn between watching the nerdery on stage versus hanging out backstage with such illustrious folks as Veronica Belmont, Marian Call, Chris Hardwick, and Aaron Douglas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/5018917622/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5018917622_5627a3ae70_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This time was easier, though, since we all hung out next to the stage and basically enjoyed the whole schmear of events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That included Grant Imahara as Beerbot (see above pic)! Paul &amp;amp; Storm asked Grant to build them a robot that could serve beer, but Grant didn’t have enough time (mostly due to MythBusters being up for an Emmy), so he made a costume and walked on stage with beer. When they pulled the robot head off, revealing Grant’s lovely flesh-and-blood head beneath, the crowd roared… just as they did when Adam said he had his own Beerbot, the ByronBeerBot, shown here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=88037&amp;amp;id=1352425447#!/photo.php?pid=1638794&amp;amp;id=1352425447&amp;amp;ref=fbx_album"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/kiki_sigler_w00tstock.jpg" alt="kiki_sigler_w00tstock" title="kiki_sigler_w00tstock" width="250" height="217"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There was music, comedy, silliness, and sometimes all three simultaneously. &lt;a href="http://www.mikephirman.com/"&gt;Mike Phirman&lt;/a&gt; was amazing, as was &lt;a href="http://sweetafton23.com/"&gt;Molly Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, and really everyone else. It was also very cool to see my old friends &lt;a href="http://www.scottsigler.com"&gt;Scott Sigler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/24/my-twit-video-interview-is-online/"&gt;Dr. Kiki&lt;/a&gt; there, and my new friend &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/sarakessell"&gt;Sara Kessell&lt;/a&gt;, who can do some sort of run in 12 parsecs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave my dirty astronomy talk again, and the crowd apparently enjoyed themselves. I won’t embed the video here, as it contains some, ah, off-color jokes, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJcOX-y0GHY"&gt;but here’s a link to a video that has most of the talk in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When astronomers do comedy, they don’t go blue. They go ultraviolet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/sets/72157625020254736/"&gt;a few pictures from backstage on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, and a search there will yield lots more. Lots of videos on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=videos&amp;amp;search_query=w00tstock&amp;amp;search_sort=video_date_uploaded&amp;amp;suggested_categories=24%2C23%2C10%2C19&amp;amp;uni=3"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get a chance to go to w00tstock, &lt;strong&gt;take it&lt;/strong&gt;. And remember, &lt;a href="http://w00tstock.net/2010/09/20/adam-and-paul-storm-in-boulder/"&gt;there’s a kinda sorta w00tstock coming to Boulder October 23, too&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be there with Paul &amp;amp; Storm and Adam Savage™ as well. It’ll be fun, and if you come I’ll give you a puppy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; No I won’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Instead, we found a condescending poster that assumes you’ve never seen a checkbook, handled your own expenses, or even held a job before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart features a blonde woman contemplating living on her own dime. The advice is basic — not a bad thing, necessarily — but in between subtitles like “Compare your income to your expenses,” the actual suggestions are barely helpful at best, and pretty insulting at worst:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Think about your bank managers and credit counselors — any of them attractive?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You probably have a little spare time now. Get a part time job!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Expect higher car payments and insurance when you get that sports car.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are equally sexist and appalling, showing the blonde divorcee trying her hand at the aforementioned part time job: As an “office worker,” “ballet dancer,” or “janitress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone please come up with a better guide to post-divorce finances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this post from Ronnie Koenig at &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/2010/09/29/weight-loss-surgery-increases-the-risk-of-suicide/"&gt;AOL Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that patients who undergo &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/obesity/weight-loss-surgery"&gt;weight loss surgery&lt;/a&gt; have a higher rate of &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/conditions/suicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; in the years following the procedure than the rest of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rates of suicide are still low for people who have had the surgery but higher than the norm, &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68R5FM20100928"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt;. The procedure, which alters the digestive tract to limit food intake, has been shown to help severely &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/obesity"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt; individuals lose a significant amount of weight and, in turn, ward off and sometimes reverse obesity-related problems such as &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/health-concern/type-2-diabetes"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study followed Pennsylvania residents who underwent &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/conditions/bariatric-surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; for a 10-year period and tracked the number of suicides in that group.  Among 16,683 people who had bariatric surgery between 1995 and 2004, 31  committed suicide by the end of 2006. The data revealed a suicide rate  of nearly 14 per 10,000 men per year and five per 10,000 women each  year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those numbers are much higher than the suicide rates among Pennsylvania  residents in the same 35 to 64 age range, during the same period. Among  all men in the state, the suicide rate in 2005 was 2.5 per 10,000, while  the rate among women was just 0.6 per 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren’t getting any younger, and we certainly aren’t getting any skinnier. The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;/a&gt;recently reported that the U.S. &lt;a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rate is “still disturbingly high” and could actually be rising in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another economic organization also estimates that three of four  Americans will be overweight by 2020, which will, in turn, increase  health care costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s goal of reducing obesity by 15 percent by 2010 seems to  have turned into an unattainable goal, as more than 30 percent of the  country’s population is now obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult to &lt;a href="http://www.thatsfit.com/tag/lose%20weight"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; and even more difficult to keep it off,” said Lisa Cimperman, a  clinical dietitian and nutritionist with University Hospitals. “People  don’t maintain their new habits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like celebrities need all the help they can get, so it should come as no surprise that plenty of celebs turn to self-help books when the going gets rough. &lt;a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-12-celebs-who-are-all-about-self-help-books/"&gt;The Frisky&lt;/a&gt; recently posted a gallery of 12 celebrities who are self-help lit enthusiasts — some are definite surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Lindsay Lohan read &lt;em&gt;The Power of Rest: Why Sleep Alone Is Not Enough. A 30-Day Plan to Reset Your Body &lt;/em&gt;around town certainly gives the impression that she’s turned over a new leaf — but she could just be holding a book to improve her image. Do you think these celebs are legitimately trying to improve their lives, or are they just making a smart PR move?&lt;/p&gt;

(See my post &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000877.html"&gt;Lie or lay? Some disastrously unhelpful guidance&lt;/a&gt; for the details of the two horribly intertwined paradigms.)  He recommends giving the topic a rest, since teaching it is such a dead loss as regards imparting really valuable information. And a commenter named Tom (the second commenter on the post) immediately pipes up to say this: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; The point you make is indeed true, however the example of lie and lay is a curious one.  In Australia, the word lie not only survives, but has not become confused with lay in the slightest. The two retain their distinct meanings more or less unabated, forming a sharp contrast to the developments in the US. I would imagine the same would be true of most other English-speaking countries and those learning English as a second language outside the US.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will people learn that nowadays &lt;b&gt;everyone can fact-check linguistic claims of this sort&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did was to search for &lt;tt&gt;"lays on the"&lt;/tt&gt; with the added term &lt;tt&gt;site:.au&lt;/tt&gt; to restrict the search to pages served from the Australian domain; and up came about 6,350 results.  Some are spurious, sure (like a reference to a company that "lays on the BS pretty thick", which has transitive &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;lay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and thus does not confuse the two lexemes), but also an ample supply of examples like these: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; &lt;a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3061740"&gt;Lester Ellis lays on the floor in front of a wall full of trophies.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2010/06/14/155535_ntnews.html"&gt;A teddy bear lays on the window sill of the burnt out room at the scene of the fire.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/.../story-e6frexnr-1225929426191"&gt;Lote Tuqiri of the Tigers lays on the ground in pain after a heavy clash.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ausfish.com.au/vforum/archive/index.php/t-157657.html"&gt;The line lays on the bottom away from other boats props and the paynter rises more or less straight up to the boat bow from the chain.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are intransitive occurrences of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;lay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that every English teacher and every prescriptive grammar maven would say are "incorrect". They show the confusion is found on Australian sites just like it is on British and American ones. One could go on to gather more examples; there seems to be an ample supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many would it take to convince Tom that he is utterly wrong about Australian English?  I have no idea.  We could probably find enough.  But the deeper problem is that people simply do not understand that their intuitively-based reports concerning what they see and hear and read in their country are often drastically mistaken.  It is possible today to check these things empirically with some expectation of reasonable success.  But people (and this includes linguists!) still tend to think that they have veridical intuitions concerning what occurs and what does not in their linguistic milieu.  Here at Language Log we have been wrong so often that we have learned to check. &lt;/p&gt;

And today is no exception. So if you guys post some good ideas in the comments, I promise we’ll turn those into a feature called &lt;em&gt;The New and Improved Ass Kicking Thursday Afternoon Inquisition&lt;/em&gt;, or something like that. Feed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, keeping with the “AI writer’s block theme”, it occurred to me that we we use the term “dry” in many situations. When we’re out of ideas, money, etc., our well has run dry. When we’re thirsty, we’re dry. When scabs get sucked out of the holes where our wisdom teeth once were, our sockets are dry. Some of our humor is dry. Our wine can be dry. When we’re not damp, we’re dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of any connotation you prefer . . . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do when you’re dry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285875441922"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/atheists_have_conquered_americ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b50d80f2932a6e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Atheists have conquered America by being really good at trivia</title><published>2010-09-30T20:20:14Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T20:20:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/U-kn1nmt19s/atheists_have_conquered_americ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/atheists_have_conquered_americ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/us/28religion.html?_r=1"&gt;Pew Forum surveyed Americans on their knowledge of religion&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered that the group most generally knowledgeable about world religions was…those unshriven hellbound godless folk. This does not sit well with many believers, who have long preferred to relegate atheists to a hell of total unawareness of the gods, smugly assuming that if only we knew what they knew, we'd be True Believers in god in general and their specific, narrow sect in particular. That we might actually know what they believe and not only choose to not believe, but also to regard their superstitions as ridiculous, is &lt;i&gt;unthinkable&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have a difficult time finding someone more offended by reality than John Mark Reynolds, professor of Catholic rationalization at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. He's got an excuse: &lt;a href="http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/john_mark_reynolds/2010/09/trivia_kings_but_bad_thinkers_understanding_over_facts.html"&gt;atheists are trivia kings but bad thinkers&lt;/a&gt;. We'd do well on the home Bible version of Jeopardy, but you see, we really don't &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; the facts, and we lack the wisdom to hear the secret music of theology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surprises me. Apparently, the Trinity is trivia, an idea I can sort of sympathize with, but Professor Reynolds&amp;#39; own Catholic faith waged bloody wars over the Arian heresy—people by the thousands were slaughtered because they didn&amp;#39;t believe that Jesus and the Holy Ghost had equal status and substance with the One True God. Ask the Visigoths. Oh, you can&amp;#39;t — &lt;i&gt;they're all dead&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we learn that transubstantiation is also trivial! Where was John Mark Reynolds a few years ago? I could have used his help calming the raging hordes of Catholics who were outraged that I should desecrate a cracker. He was on their side, damning me as a vandal of all that was right and good, you say? Oh. I guess it wasn't all so trivial after all. And again, representatives of his faith have in the past used the sanctity of their magic crackers as an excuse to slaughter thousands of Jews, men, women, and children, for imagined slights against that trivia. What a shame that they died over something so unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Mark Reynolds is not done undercutting his own points right there in the title of his article, though. No, he pens an incoherent, inconsistent, contradictory mess of assertions because atheists outscore his team in trivia contests. The Christian martyr complex is on full display here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a boutique belief system in the United States, atheism has a good many advantages. There are so few atheists and agnostics that they do not run all the risks of a populist movement. Not for them is the burden of dealing with the masses of a global population, their idiosyncrasies, worries and all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since Christians make up three-quarters or more of the American general population, we have the burden of accounting for almost everybody's problems. Sadly, we are much less well represented in elite education, media, and government. This is not because religion is incompatible with elite education, but because "skepticism" about religion has become a sociological way for the elite to mark themselves off from the rest of us. In this sense, anti-religion (and in particularly anti-Catholicism) serves the same function that joining the "right" church used to serve in another era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, atheists are the ones who are trivial — we&amp;#39;re so few in numbers that we hardly count, and since we make no difference at all we escape responsibility. We&amp;#39;re &lt;i&gt;negligible&lt;/i&gt;, just the thin scum riding on the surface of the deep ocean of Christianity. And Christianity…oh, man, poor Christians. They&amp;#39;re the responsible ones who have to take care of all those sick people and maintain the economy and work so hard to maintain everyone else&amp;#39;s moral probity. Atheism is just the fashionable façade of the &amp;quot;elites&amp;quot; (I do so wish the people who sneer at &amp;quot;elites&amp;quot; would look up the meaning of the word. It is not a synonym for &amp;quot;dregs&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did learn something new here. Despite the pitiful fact of our miniscule numbers and complete irrelevance, teachers are mostly atheists, Fox News and CNN are run by atheists, and most our senators and representatives and governors are atheists. It's as if we belong to a secret sinister cabal that has sneakily taken over the entire culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a strange state of civilization that Reynolds imagines. Christianity is entirely responsible for all the important stuff, but somehow, this insignificant film of godless elitists are entirely responsible for every one of the faults of society. We have a culture of entertainment that is all the fault of a tiny minority, and no, no, no, Christians didn't participate in or create any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secular elite has provided most of us with wretched religious education by all but banning it as a topic for serious enquiry or discussion. Meanwhile, they know just enough about religion to get some "facts" right on a pop-religion quiz, but have no grasp on why, despite all temptations, some thoughtful folk remain religious. They know some of the lyrics of religion, but cannot hear the music.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You might blame Christian education in churches for this problem, except a culture of entertainment has reduced most Americans ability to tolerate difficult discussions. Pity the pastor, with seminary training in ancient languages and a carefully constructed sermon, who must face a congregation taught by television to anticipate education with Muppets and Katy Perry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn you, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeggieTales"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Veggie Tales&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you spawn of the Global Atheist Conspiracy! Elmo is Satan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reynolds returns to his contradictory message that only Christianity does good, while atheism tells people to commit criminal acts that will get them sent to jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, Christians must clean up the mess of broader culture, but we have had little power to create pop culture in the last fifty years. The poor and the disadvantaged are always the first to bear the brunt of bad cultural ideas and only the religious remain on the ground to try to help. Christians, for example, try to keep people from doing the things that get men sent to prison, but then work hard to help prisoners once people fail.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In this sense it is easier to be an agnostic or atheist. You have rejected the mainstream of American history, which means you don't have to take responsibility for its failures, though you can appropriate its successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, Professor Reynolds! Isn't this whole essay patently about denying Christian responsibility for the current state of affairs, placing the entire blame on the shoulders of a minority you simultaneously deride as being so tiny they can't take credit for anything? How do you get a professorship when your brain is so confused and inconsistent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, right. He's at &lt;i&gt;Biola&lt;/i&gt;. Never mind. Being a fervent defender of the faith is enough there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, we have to look at a peculiar tangent the Catholic professor takes. He's open-minded, he's advocating learning more about lots of religions, so he has to suggest that we learn more about all kinds of weird cults and sects and beliefs, and that means even learning about the Latter Day Saints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the most influential books first published by an American is the Book of Mormon. It appears in almost no American government school curriculum, though it exercises a global influence and impacts the lives of millions of Americans. This is foolish. I am, to say the least, no Mormon partisan, but there are entire states in our nation that cannot be understood without some grounding in Mormon thought.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How many American college graduates have a more charitable comprehension of the indigenous culture of Paris than of Salt Lake City? Mormon Utah can only wish it were treated as gently as "other cultures" are in a politically correct curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s interesting. I lived in Salt Lake City for seven years. I frequently left the walled enclave of the University of Utah to explore Mormon culture — I&amp;#39;ve heard the Tabernacle Choir, I read parts of the &lt;i&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Pearl of Great Price&lt;/i&gt; (but not their entireties, there are limits to the schlock I can digest), I took the official tours, I've read on the history of Utah, I visited the genealogy archives, I've shopped at ZCMI and played with my kids at Liberty Park. I know Mormon culture about as well as a curious Gentile can, so once again, here's an atheist with significant knowledge about a faith he denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what I learned about Mormonism? It's a lot of wacky bullshit, with some very nasty misogynistic undertones. I also encourage everyone to learn more about this foolishness, one of the many brands of pretentious nonsense advocated under the guise of religion, but I will not suggest that our views of this poison have to be "charitable". Why should they be? It's far wiser and not at all trivial to recognize that millions of people live lies and believe in fairy tales that are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been informed that Reynolds is not Catholic. He belongs to some weird Eastern Orthodox sect. Knowing this, however, is simply trivia, so I can't feel too guilty about missing the details of his superstition. He might think it's non-trivial, though, since he did &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/09/local/me-47852"&gt;almost lose his job over it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/atheists_have_conquered_americ.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/U-kn1nmt19s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285875435761"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3160376115414307484">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca23469f01134678</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">It&amp;#39;s International Blasphemy Rights Day 2010</title><published>2010-09-30T17:58:00Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T18:26:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/mSIdPSXIoEQ/its-international-blasphemy-rights-day.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3160376115414307484/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3160376115414307484" title="7 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/09/its-international-blasphemy-rights-day.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Yep, &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/oncampus/events/international_blasphemy_rights_day_093010/"&gt;that's right&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bring on your blasphemies right here.

&lt;p&gt;I am new to this, but would like to know what you think.  I was raised  in a Christian home, but since being an adult, I do not believe in what  Christians call God. Whenever I questioned my family, they would tell me I had to get on my knees and beg God to forgive me. If there is a God, a  forgiving God, then why would I have to beg him to forgive me? Every day, I receive e-mails from lots of my friends stating that “God loves me and  is watching over me”. I love my friends and family dearly. I don’t know how they would take it if they knew my feelings on this subject.  I am nothing like Madalyn Murray O’Hair. I have feelings for others. I just need a nice way to let my family and friends know how I feel without offending their beliefs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this.&lt;br&gt;
A fellow friendly atheist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear fellow friendly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter how nice a way you find to tell them, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; someone wants to feel offended by your not having the same beliefs, they will.  That is because such “offence” is not from anger or hurt, since you have said nothing angering or hurtful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s from fear or pretence, or both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If their faith is thin and fragile, they will feel threatened by someone who is intelligent, sane, and decent, but who simply isn’t convinced of what they want to keep believing.  They will cover their fear with a veneer of anger.  If they want you and others to think that their faith is strong, they will bluster and bristle, berating you loudly in a pretence of pious indignation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they really had strong and genuine faith, they would respond to you with patient understanding, still treating you lovingly and respectfully, reflecting the best teaching of their religion. Sadly, that is very rare, at least in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though you do your best to be polite, diplomatic, gentle, sensitive, and reassuring of your love, you’ll have no guarantee of getting a similar response in return, because their response is about &lt;em&gt;them,&lt;/em&gt; not you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, that hard reality is &lt;b&gt;not an excuse&lt;/b&gt; for someone to be rude, tactless, hurtful or cold when they come out. The family’s and friends’ initial reactions may not be the final outcome in the relationship. It will be harder to improve things if the unbeliever verifies and galvanizes their prejudices with discourteous behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to telling your family, &lt;em&gt;prudence,&lt;/em&gt; the wise consideration of your own self interest, is important, especially for younger atheists and agnostics. In general, the younger the person, the more they have to risk by coming out.  In your case, you indicate that you’re an adult, so hopefully that includes having financial independence from your family as well as emotional independence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin and end with “I love you.” Tell them that you have come to need more to be convinced of God than repetition and reassurance.  It’s how you are &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from them, not superior or inferior to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasize that your lack of belief does not reduce your love for them, or your interest in their wellbeing. Tell them that even though you are not convinced of what they believe, you are very convinced of their goodness as persons. Then ask them to consider you in the same way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your delivery is probably more important than your actual statements. Be calm, warm, soft-spoken and honest. Frequently take deep, slow breaths. There’s nothing like oxygen to help keep your mind clear.    Do that quietly, so it won’t sound like a rhetorical sigh, which they might interpret as exasperation or belittlement.  That might bring up their resentment, and the communication will deteriorate.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep these conversations brief, in installments. If you don’t know how to respond to something or if the tension is rising, saying “I’ll think about that, and we’ll talk again” is a legitimate response. Coming back later with thoughtful and cool-headed replies is better for both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can anticipate from your experience with them what they are likely to try. They might try intellectual arguments or emotional manipulations.  In either case, take your time, think carefully before you speak, &lt;em&gt;respond instead of react,&lt;/em&gt; and use “I’ll get back to you on that” as often as you need. Family discussions like this do not have to be run like televised political debates, expecting instant, flawless and irrefutable rebuttals on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since your family has a history of giving you godly guilt trips, you’ll probably get some more of that.  In response to the usual threats of damnation, just keep calmly repeating something to the effect, &lt;em&gt;“If God exists, then that is up to him. You cannot predict what he will do. He knows what I need, and he does not need you to change me for him.”&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may try the guilt trip about how you are shaming them in the eyes of the community.  Don’t fall for it. Quietly say something like, &lt;em&gt;“The community should respect you for what you do for the community. I cannot fake something just to make others approve of you when you’ve earned it yourself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might even try saying that you are shaming them in the eyes of the Lord. Keep your composure, and don’t roll your eyes.  Look them straight in the eyes and gently say, &lt;em&gt;“I cannot spoil your relationship with God any more than you can fix my relationship with God. I’m interested in &lt;b&gt;our&lt;/b&gt; relationship, you and me. That is entirely up to you and me being willing to lovingly accept each other as we are. I’m willing, are you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may try to theorize about your private reasons for not believing, attributing it to youthful rebellion, or wanting liberty to indulge your base desires, or dozens of other ridiculous attempts to characterize your personal motives.  Again, use patience, oxygen, and a leisurely pace, responding in your own words with something like, &lt;em&gt;“You cannot read my mind. Please don’t tell me what my thoughts, feelings and motives are. Please have the courtesy of &lt;b&gt;asking&lt;/b&gt; me what they are.  This is the same courtesy that I am showing you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your religious friends, you have more latitude to be more frank, although a calm and poised manner will still help.  We can cherish our friendships as deeply as we do our families, but the contract between friends is completely voluntary, not imposed by the accident of birth or entangled with ties of clan and familial duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is likely that regardless of how careful you are, you’re going to lose &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; friends. Let it be so.  Those who stay will be the ones worth having, and those who leave are the ones you’re probably better off without.  Be &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt; Be with those who like being with &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; as you really are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To your friends who send you those religious emails, try a response in your own words like &lt;em&gt;“Dear (blank), thank you for your email assuring me that God loves me.  I know that is important to you.  What I really would rather hear is that &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; love me. I want to make it clear that I love you dearly. For me, love means &lt;b&gt;me&lt;/b&gt; actually being there for you when you are in need, hurting, lonely or afraid, and that is what I intend. I won’t be hoping that a substitute will stand in my place.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow friendly, do the best that you can with your family and friends, and accept that the outcome will then depend on something you cannot control, the maturity of others. Don’t expect perfect performance from you or them.  Keep your heart open, realizing that their first reaction may not be their final one, that in time they may see the value of the love that you have offered and are still offering. I wish you the very best of results. I know that I’d be proud to have so gentle and caring a person in my family or as my friend.  &lt;/p&gt;

I am certain that their full impact on evolution is overwhelmingly larger than they are given credit for at present....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a virologist in a biotech company in Singapore. Here’s my story: I’ve been interested in infectious diseases since I was a kid, because my father almost died of TB when he was an infant. I must have been the only kid who looked forward to mass vaccination days in school. For a field trip to the Philippines after my bachelor’s and my first job shortly thereafter, I had to be immunized against a lot of other things that the average person doesn’t. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The choice of motif was inspired by a verse from the Biblical book of Revelation (a k a Apocalypse): “On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.” The “tree of life” motif in Western folk art is a tree bearing various different fruits on its branches. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was stupid and didn’t check the stencil after the tattooist smudged one part, which is why there are two “PV”s; one should have been “HAV” for Hepatitis A. Like everybody else in this part of the world, I’ve had the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/prevention/BCG.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; but will not add a “TB” fruit until a truly effective tuberculosis vaccine is invented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/08/06/science-tattoo-emporium-the-book/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month, I’m turning the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/science-tattoo-emporium/"&gt;Science Tattoo Emporium&lt;/a&gt; into a book called &lt;em&gt;Science Ink&lt;/em&gt;. The ultimate purpose of the book, like the Emporium, will be to illustrate the passion that science can inspire. To that end, I also plan to donate a portion of the proceeds from the book to &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt;, a great organization that funds science projects in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few weeks, I’ve been inundated with lots of book-ready images–not just bigger versions of the ones I’ve put on the blog, but many new ones as well. I originally set a deadline of October 1 (tomorrow), so that I and my designers could put the book together in time for its fall 2011 publication date. A day before the deadline, we’ve got many more images than we set as our target number, which is gratifying. But we keep getting last-minute emails from people like Shi-Hsia Hwa with more ink to offer. Who are we to turn our noses to this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the deal: I’m extending the deadline to &lt;strong&gt;October 15&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/carl@carlzimmer.com"&gt;Contact me&lt;/a&gt; for submission details. And if anyone has had any trouble uploading their tattoo pictures, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/carl@carlzimmer.com"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This semester I teach Anth 143: Biology of Human Behavior, an introductory-level course that covers the basics of evolution, behavioral biology, and the interaction of biology and culture. My hope is that these posts are useful not only for my current students, but other reasons hoping to gain background or insight into these topics.This week I have been trying to finish up two large writing projects: a new IRB and a manuscript draft. So posting has been light. I also admit to having a little trouble figuring out whether to foreground this particular Around the Web post with some of my own thoughts about this topic. I&amp;#39;ve decided to risk it.I have two main thoughts I want to offer, one on each half of the lecture I gave Tuesday; these comments will ground the links I&amp;#39;m sharing.Honest signaling and mate preferencesDue to time constraints, I didn&amp;#39;t feel I could go into much detail about my unease about this particular field of research. Much of the work done on human mate preferences is quite good, especially the work that either links the preferences to fecundity/fertility (i.e., Jasienska et al 2004), or to actual reproductive success (i.e., Apicella et al 2007). What worries me when I teach this material in a large, introductory setting is that, despite any caveats I may offer about the research, students often walk away from lecture thinking that all women like strong, masculine men who are good hunters, and all men like young, feminine women with big birthing hips. This is simply not true. You can look at the assortment of who marries who and find a lot more variation, and that&amp;#39;s because there is so much variation in mating strategy. Perhaps if someone gives you a range of faces and asks you which you prefer you choose one in line with honest signals for immune health or fertility. But do you have sex with this person or enter into a long-term relationship with this person? Not necessarily, because honest signals of health are only ONE of many factors you consider when choosing a mate. Cultural conditioning, humor, kindness, proximity, religion, political leanings... these are all issues that confound choice purely for good genes. And that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.In fact, an interesting article just came out that shows how some traits in preferred versus actual mates are similar, and how some are different. Definitely worth a read!Dr. Petra Boynton, sexpert, therapist, blogger, and all-around cool person, has a wonderful blog relevant to this week&amp;#39;s topic. I&amp;#39;ll send you over with one of my favorite posts, but check out the whole site: ten tips for successful dating.I also have to pass on an article sent to me by a student (hooray, I love when students send me stuff!). I&amp;#39;m very glad Davis Shannon sent me this article about body versus face preferences in men looking for one night stands. Of course, the style of the story is pretty offensive. I was also pretty appalled at the quote from the lead author. But in addition to exposing you all to a new study on this topic, it exposes you to an example of very bad science reporting. I think this is very useful to students learning to filter good information from bad.Finally, in an example of GOOD science journalism, I give you several selections from Not Exactly Rocket Science: one on male bowerbirds influencing mate choice in nestmaking, and one that is only barely related to this week&amp;#39;s topic, on masturbating squirrels. You heard me right. Go read it, it&amp;#39;s great.SexualityI had a rather devastating interaction with a student after class this week. This student approached me and asked me why I thought there was such a thing as homophobia. The student explained that a group of male students behind him/her were making offensive jokes during my portion of the lecture on homosexuality and were dismissive of the idea that there is a spectrum of human sexual preference that is quite normal and reflected in behaviors we see in the animal kingdom. Both the student, and I, were very upset by this, and I didn&amp;#39;t have a particularly good answer.Oppressive behaviors of one group of people towards another are not new. But I find it especially disappointing when I hear of my own students behaving in this way, especially when I have invested so much in creating lectures with active learning components that give them space to think critically. Like I said, I have no good answers, except to have zero tolerance for such behavior if I am ever in earshot. Perhaps if more people understood that, for some people in our society, it is a huge personal risk to simply express who you love, and those of us who have a more socially-condoned sexual preference can never quite understand the toll this can take on a human being.Of course, it may be an additional condolence to find out that those individuals who are most homophobic are most likely to have hidden gay urges. No, I didn&amp;#39;t make that up. It&amp;#39;s SCIENCE!And for every story of teachers suspended for assigning articles on gay animals or assistant attorney generals using internet bullying tactics on gay students, there are stories of LGBT-inclusive immigration legislation or UN efforts to end laws that discriminate against homosexuals.ReferencesApicella, C., Feinberg, D., &amp;amp; Marlowe, F.

It is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Denialism-Irrational-Thinking-Scientific-Threatens/dp/B003JTHRFU"&gt;Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Specter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remembered hearing about it somewhere before so I picked it up. When I got home, I checked out the reviews on Amazon.com and almost decided to return the book. It's not that it has a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; rating (3/5 stars), but many of the top rated reviews said that, while the topic is certainly important, it lacks the rigor to support the danger implicit in the subtitle and worse, failed to get much into why denialism exists and what should be done about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for some reason (probably laziness) I kept it and after finishing my last book, I did my general roll of the dice to determine what I'd read next from my pile and this book ended up being the scientifically selected winner. It's taken me almost 2 months to get through it, but now that I have, I think this book is one of the more important ones in the conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book starts out with Specter's thoughts on what may be part of the reason for why the rejection of science has become so commonplace. He suggests that it is due to some large failures of science that have caught the public eye. Specifically he cites things like the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl, Three-Mile Island, and Vioxx (the latter being the main focus). As he puts it&lt;blockquote&gt;Thirty years ago nobody discussed the principal motive behind scientific research: nobody needed to. It was a quest for knowledge. Today, the default assumption is that money matters most of all, and people tend to see science through the prism of commerce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The rest of the book is spent addressing several of the major forms of denialism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first is that of vaccines causing autism. In it, there is a very telling quote from Jay Gordon, Jenny McCarthy's pediatrician.&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me state very simply, vaccines can cause autism. . . . The proof is not there yet. It will be found&lt;/blockquote&gt;Belief first. Evidence later. This is a hallmark characteristic of denialists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire chapter is laced with success of vaccination efforts and the costs of not vaccinating. Although Specter never comes right out to say it, the message is clear: We cannot let unsubstantiated (or worse, disproven) fears stop us from using methods that we know save far more lives than they even hypothetically cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specter's next target is what he calls the "organic fetish" and the scare over genetically modified foods. This is a topic I haven't gotten much into, but Specter makes many good points in the chapter. All food is genetically modified by hundreds and thousands of years of artificial selection. But by adding genes to add nutritional value as well as growth, we can and have improved the quality and quantity of food we produce. Given that "natural" foods haven't been fortified with extra vitamins, GMOs are in reality much better for us than the organic ones. In addition, they are designed to last longer and need less pesticides which are harmful to both our health and the environment. It's pretty much wins all around, except perhaps for a loss of some flavor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While a loss of flavor vs a gain of nutrition isn't a huge problem in the US, where we don't have much of a problem getting balanced meals (whether or not we choose to is a different story), other nations don't have that luxury. GM foods would allow for poor nations to produce enough food of sufficient quality to feed their people. But many nations have chosen to ban GMOs because of the fear-mongering of the anti-GM crowd and instead, will let their residents starve. I think this is one of the many points Specter makes that really back up the claim made in his subtitle. When fear trumps progress, people die in the meantime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "alt-med" fad was the topic of the next chapter. From homeopathy to nutritional supplements, Specter addressed the effectiveness of each and concluded that few were of any value (of those that he did concede were some vitamins, calcium, and folic acid for pregnant women). And worse, many were outright harmful. One example he cited was that of Ephedra, a drug that "boosts adrenaline, stresses the heart, raises blood pressure, and is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, anxiety, psychosis, and death." Which is probably why the FDA finally banned it, causing outrage in the alt-med community, because, yet again, "[b]elief outranks effectiveness."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bigger problem I, and Specter see, is that this nonsensical belief takes funding away from research that has true potential. In no case is this more true than the alt-med one, in which the denialism camp has fought so hard, they've conned the US government into funding a major scientific organization, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), to review treatments that have already been demonstrated not to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This organization does operate scientifically, doing rigorous tests and coming to valid conclusions, the point is that these reviews shouldn't need to be done in the first place. Instead, we now spend $121 million annually to tell ourselves what we already knew: None of these "medicines" work. Thus far, the NCCAM has not approved a single treatment. Compare this amount with the funding for autism research from the government in a year which is only $118 million. Bunk science gets &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; funding?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last of the body chapters was on the need to recognize geographical background (or race) as an important consideration in medicine and how the taboo of race has largely prevented research into how differences in people of different lineages affects their responses to medicines. Again, the message is clear: while we deny the science, people die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specter concludes with a somewhat hopeful note. He discusses the potential of synthetic biology, real Intelligent Design of organisms, to change our manufacturing processes and potentially assist in everything from energy production, to cleaning up the atmosphere, to creating medicines. It's a rather utopian ideal, but the message is clear for anyone that's been paying attention; this could be our future. Are we going to let fear take it away?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, I think the book was extremely well written. My worst criticism is that it didn't go far enough. Many of the points could have been spelled out even more instead of letting readers draw the conclusions that the material points them to. After all, the people that most desperately need to read such a book, can't seem to draw intelligent conclusions for themselves. Without this, the book is little more than preaching to the choir, but I think this stems from another major point that Specter didn't address, which is the root cause of denialism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I agree that fear is a major component of it, I think there's another component that was completely overlooked which is that of the general level of scientific ignorance in the world. But such points weren't really the topic of the book. After all, the subtitle was "&lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; irrational thinking hinders scientific progress", not "&lt;i&gt;Why&lt;/i&gt; is there irrational thinking". Ultimately, I think the latter is a far thornier topic and there's no single answer. Rather, there are many, only one of which Specter touched on. I'd love to see another book on that latter topic though. I think this, along with such a book on the "why", as well as some other books illustrating other harms of pseudoscience could easily be bundled together to make one of the most important arguments for rational thinking today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So while others may criticize this book for its incompleteness, I think it's fine. It fulfilled the goals set out by its subtitle. There definitely need to be more, but that's the job of other books.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5923047028210953167?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285866581813"><id gr:original-id="http://survivingmyphd.blogspot.com/2010/09/feelings-and-evidence-science-hype.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e6d216e9b3738e02</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Hyping Astronomy</title><published>2010-09-30T12:19:27Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T12:19:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/YJgjWYl23zI/feelings-and-evidence-science-hype.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://survivingmyphd.blogspot.com/2010/09/feelings-and-evidence-science-hype.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Astronomers from the Carnegie Institution and the University of California, Santa Cruz, have discovered and earth-sized planet called Gilese 581. It&amp;#39;s 20 light-years away, which makes it an unlikely traveling destination, but this is exciting news nonetheless. The abstract is enthusiastic yet cautions, saying that:&amp;quot;The estimated equilibrium temperature of GJ 581g is 228 K, placing it squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star and offering a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet around a very nearby star.&amp;quot;The press release is about the same, emphasizing the potential habitability of the planet, how hard it was to locate it and explains a bit about radial velocity. It more-or-less follows the rules I mentioned in a previous post. The news, however, say: &amp;quot;Odds of life on nearby planet &amp;#39;100 percent,&amp;#39; astronomer says.&amp;quot; (Fox News and others).What went wrong? Where did the over-hyping come from? Unfortunately, Prof. Steven Vogt, one of the discoverers, told AP that &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have any direct way to sense that there&amp;#39;s life there, my own personal opinion is that it is hard to imagine that life has not taken a foothold there.&amp;quot;He also said: &amp;quot;Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that the chances for life on this planet are 100 percent. I have almost no doubt about it.&amp;quot; It went downhill from there. So, we have a scientist hyping his findings, and media all-to-ready to hype it. The results are false (or at least unverified) headlines. (video:  Steven Vogt talking to AP)Hat tip: Yoav Landsman (Hebrew)Vogt, S. S., Butler, P. R., Rivera, E. J., Haghighipour, N., Henry, G.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stimulate the demand for emerging energy sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster innovation with funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruit existing business and use established infrastructure to create incentives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people seem to miss that energy policy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just about the environment. There are enormous emerging economic opportunities and the U.S. can and should be a leader to reap the benefits of the changing global landscape. Will we?&lt;/p&gt;

The White Swan in Vere Street was by no means the first gay brothel in London, but it is one of the first and most accurately recorded establishments that had been set up with the aim of making money.  Perhaps the most famous of all 'molly-houses' was Mother Margaret Clapp's (more another time), but that was more of a coffee-house primarily for homosexual clientele, rather than a place where gay sex was traded for money (although there was probably an aspect of that too).  &lt;/p&gt;

This semester I teach Anth 143: Biology of Human Behavior, an introductory-level course that covers the basics of evolution, behavioral biology, and the interaction of biology and culture. My hope is that these posts are useful not only for my current students, but other reasons hoping to gain background or insight into these topics.This week I have been trying to finish up two large writing projects: a new IRB and a manuscript draft. So posting has been light. I also admit to having a little trouble figuring out whether to foreground this particular Around the Web post with some of my own thoughts about this topic. I&amp;#39;ve decided to risk it.I have two main thoughts I want to offer, one on each half of the lecture I gave Tuesday; these comments will ground the links I&amp;#39;m sharing.Honest signaling and mate preferencesDue to time constraints, I didn&amp;#39;t feel I could go into much detail about my unease about this particular field of research. Much of the work done on human mate preferences is quite good, especially the work that either links the preferences to fecundity/fertility (i.e., Jasienska et al 2004), or to actual reproductive success (i.e., Apicella et al 2007). What worries me when I teach this material in a large, introductory setting is that, despite any caveats I may offer about the research, students often walk away from lecture thinking that all women like strong, masculine men who are good hunters, and all men like young, feminine women with big birthing hips. This is simply not true. You can look at the assortment of who marries who and find a lot more variation, and that&amp;#39;s because there is so much variation in mating strategy. Perhaps if someone gives you a range of faces and asks you which you prefer you choose one in line with honest signals for immune health or fertility. But do you have sex with this person or enter into a long-term relationship with this person? Not necessarily, because honest signals of health are only ONE of many factors you consider when choosing a mate. Cultural conditioning, humor, kindness, proximity, religion, political leanings... these are all issues that confound choice purely for good genes. And that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.In fact, an interesting article just came out that shows how some traits in preferred versus actual mates are similar, and how some are different. Definitely worth a read!Dr. Petra Boynton, sexpert, therapist, blogger, and all-around cool person, has a wonderful blog relevant to this week&amp;#39;s topic. I&amp;#39;ll send you over with one of my favorite posts, but check out the whole site: ten tips for successful dating.I also have to pass on an article sent to me by a student (hooray, I love when students send me stuff!). I&amp;#39;m very glad Davis Shannon sent me this article about body versus face preferences in men looking for one night stands. Of course, the style of the story is pretty offensive. I was also pretty appalled at the quote from the lead author. But in addition to exposing you all to a new study on this topic, it exposes you to an example of very bad science reporting. I think this is very useful to students learning to filter good information from bad.Finally, in an example of GOOD science journalism, I give you several selections from Not Exactly Rocket Science: one on male bowerbirds influencing mate choice in nestmaking, and one that is only barely related to this week&amp;#39;s topic, on masturbating squirrels. You heard me right. Go read it, it&amp;#39;s great.SexualityI had a rather devastating interaction with a student after class this week. This student approached me and asked me why I thought there was such a thing as homophobia. The student explained that a group of male students behind him/her were making offensive jokes during my portion of the lecture on homosexuality and were dismissive of the idea that there is a spectrum of human sexual preference that is quite normal and reflected in behaviors we see in the animal kingdom. Both the student, and I, were very upset by this, and I didn&amp;#39;t have a particularly good answer.Oppressive behaviors of one group of people towards another are not new. But I find it especially disappointing when I hear of my own students behaving in this way, especially when I have invested so much in creating lectures with active learning components that give them space to think critically. Like I said, I have no good answers, except to have zero tolerance for such behavior if I am ever in earshot. Perhaps if more people understood that, for some people in our society, it is a huge personal risk to simply express who you love, and those of us who have a more socially-condoned sexual preference can never quite understand the toll this can take on a human being.Of course, it may be an additional condolence to find out that those individuals who are most homophobic are most likely to have hidden gay urges. No, I didn&amp;#39;t make that up. It&amp;#39;s SCIENCE!And for every story of teachers suspended for assigning articles on gay animals or assistant attorney generals using internet bullying tactics on gay students, there are stories of LGBT-inclusive immigration legislation or UN efforts to end laws that discriminate against homosexuals.ReferencesApicella, C., Feinberg, D., &amp;amp; Marlowe, F.

World shame coast in COSTA RICA

Please distribute widely. 

The Turtle eggs  are stolen to be sold.

The planet is thankful for the forwarding of this email.

The e-mail isn't an isolated incident. A quick internet search will immediately bring up sites like this one, heralding the extinction of sea turtles in Costa Rica due to the illegal harvest of their eggs.

Look, I know it looks bad. Yes, the photos are real and of people taking thousands of sea turtle eggs from the Ostional Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica. Yes, all seven species of sea turtles in the world are endangered. And yes, in general, it's illegal to even touch a sea turtle egg without a permit. But the people in these photos aren't doing anything illegal, and the Costa Rican olive ridley population is just fine. In fact, harvesting eggs may be helping the sea turtle populations.

Many new media (e.g., computer games, websites, etc.) claim to have educational benefits, but in many cases they do seem to displace old-fashioned educational activities like reading books or playing board games. There is no scarcity of research on this topic, but a recent study in the journal Child Development caught my attention because it looked at different types of media (computer, video games) and its affect on both achievement and behavior in children. In this post, I'll focus primarily on the findings concerning achievement. Here are the main aspects of the study:- studied 1,900 children age 6-12 years old for a five-year period (1997-2003)- looked at computer usage in three main areas: communications (i.e., Internet, email), games, and studyingThe findings were pretty complicated but here are some of the most interesting highlights:- boys are more likely to use the computer for games; girls are more likely to use it for communication- the results are complicated by gender and ethnicityComputer Use- for girls (both Caucasian and African American), increased overall computer use was associated with higher achievement in reading and problem solving over the five-year period studied (1997-2003)- for boys the findings were different: - for Caucasian boys, increased computer use was not associated with higher  achievement; in fact, there was one negative association--higher levels of use of  the computer for communications was associated with a decline in achievement  in the areas of reading comprehension and applied problem solving - for African American boys the findings were quite different. Higher use of  computers among African American boys (particularly for communications and  studying) was associated with an increase in achievement in reading  comprehensionVideo Games- for boys there was no association between video game time and achievement- among African American girls, there was one positive association--increased video game use was correlated with higher scores on applied problem solving-however, video game use was associated with lower verbal achievement for all girls. The authors found that this was because it displaced reading time.- it is important to note that benefits of video games were seen in moderate use; extensive use of video games was not associated with beneficial achievement outcomes (in other words, all things in moderation)It isn't completely clear why there were differences by ethnicity. The authors suggest that the benefits of media use for African Americans may be due to the fact that there is still somewhat of a media divide among ethnicities. African American children may not have as much access to media so we see benefits for those who are able to use it regularly (but not excessively). I took a couple of things away from this study. First, electronic media can be useful and have educational benefits if used in moderation. Almost all the findings suggested that excessive media use (computers or video games) were associated with lower academic achievement.Secondly, this study points out to me that you really have to know your child and be aware of how they're performing in school when considering how much computer/video game time they are allowed. There were some benefits of media usage for both boys and girls, but it depended on how the media was being used and for how long. I think this is a very important topic for research. Although researchers are continuing to study the effects of media use, we have really just scratched the surface of this topic, especially considering new forms of media and technology are emerging rapidly. No one really knows how all this new media is going to affect our children, but it seems clear that technology is not a magic bullet that will solve all our educational issues. It can be a useful educational tool for our children if used along with other types of learning.Photo credit...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This semester I teach Anth 143: Biology of Human Behavior, an introductory-level course that covers the basics of evolution, behavioral biology, and the interaction of biology and culture. My hope is that these posts are useful not only for my current students, but other reasons hoping to gain background or insight into these topics.This week I have been trying to finish up two large writing projects: a new IRB and a manuscript draft. So posting has been light. I also admit to having a little trouble figuring out whether to foreground this particular Around the Web post with some of my own thoughts about this topic. I&amp;#39;ve decided to risk it.I have two main thoughts I want to offer, one on each half of the lecture I gave Tuesday; these comments will ground the links I&amp;#39;m sharing.Honest signaling and mate preferencesDue to time constraints, I didn&amp;#39;t feel I could go into much detail about my unease about this particular field of research. Much of the work done on human mate preferences is quite good, especially the work that either links the preferences to fecundity/fertility (i.e., Jasienska et al 2004), or to actual reproductive success (i.e., Apicella et al 2007). What worries me when I teach this material in a large, introductory setting is that, despite any caveats I may offer about the research, students often walk away from lecture thinking that all women like strong, masculine men who are good hunters, and all men like young, feminine women with big birthing hips. This is simply not true. You can look at the assortment of who marries who and find a lot more variation, and that&amp;#39;s because there is so much variation in mating strategy. Perhaps if someone gives you a range of faces and asks you which you prefer you choose one in line with honest signals for immune health or fertility. But do you have sex with this person or enter into a long-term relationship with this person? Not necessarily, because honest signals of health are only ONE of many factors you consider when choosing a mate. Cultural conditioning, humor, kindness, proximity, religion, political leanings... these are all issues that confound choice purely for good genes. And that&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.In fact, an interesting article just came out that shows how some traits in preferred versus actual mates are similar, and how some are different. Definitely worth a read!Dr. Petra Boynton, sexpert, therapist, blogger, and all-around cool person, has a wonderful blog relevant to this week&amp;#39;s topic. I&amp;#39;ll send you over with one of my favorite posts, but check out the whole site: ten tips for successful dating.I also have to pass on an article sent to me by a student (hooray, I love when students send me stuff!). I&amp;#39;m very glad Davis Shannon sent me this article about body versus face preferences in men looking for one night stands. Of course, the style of the story is pretty offensive. I was also pretty appalled at the quote from the lead author. But in addition to exposing you all to a new study on this topic, it exposes you to an example of very bad science reporting. I think this is very useful to students learning to filter good information from bad.Finally, in an example of GOOD science journalism, I give you several selections from Not Exactly Rocket Science: one on male bowerbirds influencing mate choice in nestmaking, and one that is only barely related to this week&amp;#39;s topic, on masturbating squirrels. You heard me right. Go read it, it&amp;#39;s great.SexualityI had a rather devastating interaction with a student after class this week. This student approached me and asked me why I thought there was such a thing as homophobia. The student explained that a group of male students behind him/her were making offensive jokes during my portion of the lecture on homosexuality and were dismissive of the idea that there is a spectrum of human sexual preference that is quite normal and reflected in behaviors we see in the animal kingdom. Both the student, and I, were very upset by this, and I didn&amp;#39;t have a particularly good answer.Oppressive behaviors of one group of people towards another are not new. But I find it especially disappointing when I hear of my own students behaving in this way, especially when I have invested so much in creating lectures with active learning components that give them space to think critically. Like I said, I have no good answers, except to have zero tolerance for such behavior if I am ever in earshot. Perhaps if more people understood that, for some people in our society, it is a huge personal risk to simply express who you love, and those of us who have a more socially-condoned sexual preference can never quite understand the toll this can take on a human being.Of course, it may be an additional condolence to find out that those individuals who are most homophobic are most likely to have hidden gay urges. No, I didn&amp;#39;t make that up. It&amp;#39;s SCIENCE!And for every story of teachers suspended for assigning articles on gay animals or assistant attorney generals using internet bullying tactics on gay students, there are stories of LGBT-inclusive immigration legislation or UN efforts to end laws that discriminate against homosexuals.ReferencesApicella, C., Feinberg, D., &amp;amp; Marlowe, F.

Their latest embarrassment is yet another piece of work from James O'Keefe, the young mastermind who dressed up as a pimp and dishonestly edited a videotape to make ACORN look like it supported prostitution, and then also bungled a break-in to bug Sen. Mary Landrieu's Louisiana office, and is now continuing his career as a professional idiot and thug with a flopped attempt to catch a CNN reporter using her sexual wiles to bamboozle him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's unbelievably stupid. The reporter gave no indication of flirting for information, but O'Keefe apparently assumed that any blonde reporter was a bimbo. He invited her to come to his boat for an interview, and then stocked it with all the paraphernalia a misogynist might imagine a woman would find irresistible: porn mags, dildos, handcuffs, mirrors on the ceiling, that sort of thing, and hidden cameras. &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201009290020"&gt;The plan&lt;/a&gt; was to have Abbie Boudreau show up, wave a dildo seductively at her, and when she succumbed to his charms to get top secret Republican operative information from him, catch it all on tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's just astonishing. Where did O'Keefe get his ideas about how to seduce a woman, from men's wank magazines? He must have had some delusion that his scheme would actually work, rather than ending with him writhing on the ground cradling his bruised privates while the CNN reporter stormed off of the Love Boat with a juicy story about sleazy Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for all concerned, one of the organizers of this tasteless charade had a scrap of a conscience and told all, sparing O&amp;#39;Keefe a pair of splattered testicles but still giving CNN a great story (the conscientious person has apparently been fired…unsurprisingly). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://siu.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/29/our-documentary-takes-a-strange-detour/"&gt;Boudreau herself has written up the full story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to ask…why does Breitbart and his little acolytes still get air time on the news networks? Why isn&amp;#39;t O&amp;#39;Keefe in jail for his criminal attempted wire-tapping stunt? Why aren&amp;#39;t we seeing a takedown of his prior video staging to falsely indict ACORN? Why aren&amp;#39;t small children breaking into tears and adults spitting on these people when they walk down the street?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/our_students_arent_children_bu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tT13odIOdBc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285861579781"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=21662">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/224c278a0d844c14</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="chat"/><category term="Nerdist"/><category term="The Node"/><title type="html">Live chat with me at Nerdist</title><published>2010-09-30T15:00:50Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T15:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/WG4FbQm6D6M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/30/live-chat-with-me-at-nerdist/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://node.nerdist.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/node_logo.jpg" alt="node_logo" title="node_logo" width="250" height="95"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At 11:00 a.m. Mountain time (13:00 Eastern, 17:00 GMT) I will be in the live chat room on &lt;a href="http://node.nerdist.com"&gt;The Nerdist’s Node website&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For nearly six months, Andrew Shirvell, an assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan, has waged an internet campaign against college student Chris Armstrong, the openly gay student assembly president at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the online moniker “Concerned Michigan Alumnus,” Shirvell launched his blog in late April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to ‘Chris Armstrong Watch,’” Shirvell wrote in his inaugural blog post. “This is a site for concerned University of Michigan alumni, students, and others who oppose the recent election of Chris Armstrong — a RADICAL HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVIST, RACIST, ELITIST, &amp;amp; LIAR — as the new head of student government.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is news to you, watch Shirvell get interview by Anderson Cooper. It’s one of the most uncomfortable interviews you’ll ever see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General.  For real.  I’m impressed Anderson kept calm the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a step back for a second, though.  As you listen to Shirvell, it’s clear that every single argument he makes is something the Christian Right has said before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not a bigot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a hateful bone in my body. I love gay people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t care if he’s gay; I only care that he advances a “radical homosexual agenda.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter LaBarbera&lt;/strong&gt;, the people at the Illinois Family Institute, the anti-gay-marriage groups, everyone who spoke at &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/08/10/the-aftah-anti-gay-rights-academy-from-the-perspective-of-two-who-attended-day-1-of-3/"&gt;the AFTAH anti-gay seminar&lt;/a&gt; — this is the exact kind of rhetoric they use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything a gay person does, it seems, is part of a “radical agenda.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim they love gay people… and show that love by making their lives a living hell.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know gay students are constantly harassed and yet they &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=34961"&gt;fight against bullying legislation&lt;/a&gt; that would protect those students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not stalk individuals like Shirvell is doing, but other than that, I don’t see much of a difference.  I’m only shocked they haven’t all come quickly to his defense.  (Even &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; must realize this guy’s a creeper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what did the student body president do that has Shirvell so worked up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Armstrong has supported gender-neutral housing at the university for transgender students who haven’t had sexual reassignment surgery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT?!  OH NO!  HE’S DESTROYING THE WORLD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think Shirvell would be more freaked out by same-sex dorms — clearly promoting the radical homosexual agenda of the people in the Residence Life department… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, besides all that, it’s the last 30 seconds that really hammer home the main issue here.  If Shirvell has to represent a gay client, will that person get a fair hearing under the law?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirvell avoided the question entirely.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a form of accommodationism that, while attacking the deficiencies of both science and faith, tries to combine them in a wooly-minded nexus. That is what Templeton, for instance, is trying to do.  This week, on &lt;em&gt;New Scientist’s&lt;/em&gt; “opinion” site, you find &lt;a href="http://www.eagleman.com/"&gt;David Eagleman&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, taking atheists to task for their lack of humility and the faithful for their lack of evidence.  He claims  to have found a superor third way that is neither fish nor fowl: &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-beyond-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html?full=true"&gt; possibilianism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while there are plenty of good books by scientist-atheists, they sometimes under-emphasise the main lesson from science: that our knowledge is vastly outstripped by our ignorance. For me, a life in science prompts awe and exploration over dogmatism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see—who are those book-writing scientist-atheists? Dawkins, surely, and Victor Stenger.  Perhaps Sam Harris as well.  It wasn’t my impression that these guys failed to concede our vast ignorance about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these considerations, I do not call myself an atheist. I don’t feel that I have enough data to firmly rule out other interesting possibilities. On the other hand, I do not subscribe to any religion. Traditional religious stories can be beautiful and often crystallise hard-won wisdom – but it is hardly a challenge to poke holes in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those “interesting possibilities” would seem to be supernatural ones, since that’s what atheism has provisionally ruled out.   Yet Eagleman’s “possibilites” seem to fall within the purview of science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it seems we know too little to commit to strict atheism, and too much to commit to any religion. Given this, I am often surprised by the number of people who seem to possess total certainty about their position. I know a lot of atheists who seethe at the idea of religion, and religious followers who seethe at the idea of atheism – but neither group is bothering with more interesting ideas. They make their impassioned arguments as though the God versus no-God dichotomy were enough for a modern discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we were planted here by aliens? What if there are civilisations in spatial dimensions seven through nine? What if we are nodes in a vast, cosmic, computational device? . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the enormous “possibility space” of stories that can be dreamed up. Take the entirety of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition as a single point in this possibility space. The eastern religions are another point. Strict atheism is another point. Now think of the immense landscape of the points in between. Many of these points will contain stories that are crazy, silly, or merely wildly improbable. But in the absence of data, they can’t be ruled out of that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I call myself a “possibilian”. Possibilianism emphasises the active exploration of new, unconsidered notions. A possibilian is comfortable holding multiple ideas in mind and is not driven by the idea of fighting for a single, particular story. The key emphasis of possibilianism is to shine a flashlight around the possibility space. It is a plea not simply for open-mindedness, but for an active exploration of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doesn’t this sound just like &lt;em&gt;science? &lt;/em&gt; Indeed, Eagletnan’s program seems to be one of scientific exploration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the realm of what is addressable, we profitably apply logic to further knowledge. Possibilianism is “anything goes at first” – but we then use science to rule out parts of the possibility space, and often to rule in new parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, if we think we were put here by space aliens (presumably as a naked replicating molecule, since we already know we weren’t planted here as primates), we need to look for evidence for that.  If evidence is impossible to get, then we might as well dismiss the project, since no answers will be forthcoming.  But Eagleman plays down the fact that his “possibility” space includes a lot of supernatural assertions that are either falsified by science or incapable of scientific refutation because they’ve rendered themselves immune to disproof.  And those possibilities are outside his program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagleman’s problem is that he doesn’t clearly distinguish his Third Way from science itself, so I’m not sure why he wrote this piece. Indeed, I’m not sure what he &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;.  In the end, his post seems to be a misguided way to empower supernaturalism and spiritualism—and appeal to their adherents—without saying so directly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>whyevolutionistrue</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Why Evolution Is True</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285855596398"><id gr:original-id="http://www.drsharma.ca/weight-management-never-stops.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f6541538832c99f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Weight Management Never Stops</title><published>2010-09-30T08:00:29Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T08:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/RPAK_htORjI/weight-management-never-stops.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.drsharma.ca/weight-management-never-stops.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">This morning, on the last day of the 23rd Scientific Meeting of the International Society of Hypertension, I present a 60 min session on obesity management.

&lt;p&gt;I watched the speeches live on C-SPAN. Many Representatives of both parties didn’t like parts of the bill, but felt it was important to pass it. I agree; I have reservations with it as well. However, most of this bill is just fine, and hits the right notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone agreed. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) strongly opposed the bill, for example (interestingly, she’s Chair of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and her husband and brother-in-law are astronauts). &lt;a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/09/nasas-senate-bill-passes-dramatic-debate-vote-congress/" rel="nofollow"&gt;She apparently is one of the few people&lt;/a&gt; still holding onto the idea that we should continue to work on the Constellation rocket system which will be defunded with this bill. I disagree with her on that quite strongly (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did make some good points, things I myself said in my earlier post. For example, the bill is too specific in what kind of rocket should succeed the Shuttle. That’s not for Congress to decide; they should make broader goals that align with what NASA wants to do, and then allow NASA engineers to make the system. Of course, there was consulting with NASA on the bill, but the bill itself shouldn’t go into details like that. Anyway, despite that, I strongly disagree with Rep. Giffords that this bill should have been voted down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really galled me, though, was that several Republicans blamed President Obama for NASA’s current mess, including Ralph Hall (R-TX, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/02/followup-rep-ralph-halls-unbelievable-statement-on-science-funding-bill/"&gt;remember him?&lt;/a&gt;). This is  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/16/akin-breakin-heart/"&gt;grossly and demonstrably unfair and untrue&lt;/a&gt;. Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) hammered over and again the idea that Obama is trying to kill the manned space program. That is not true, and in fact the current situation (including the five year gap between the Shuttle and any follow-on rocket system) started in the Bush Administration. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/28/one-nasa-manager-maneuvers-to-save-constellation/"&gt;Constellation has been in trouble for some time&lt;/a&gt;, behind schedule and over-budget. I’m of the opinion that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/15/obama-lays-out-bold-and-visionary-revised-space-policy/"&gt;Obama’s plan&lt;/a&gt; to defund Constellation does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; kill the manned space program as Culberson said it will. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/07/senator-kay-bailey-hutchison-r-tex-disses-private-space/"&gt;I have written about this repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;: far from killing it, this new direction may save NASA from the mess it finds itself in right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s weird is how Culberson used the bogeyman of Obama to try to gain sympathy for the bill, saying that a yes vote on the bill would stop Obama’s plan to dismantle NASA. I find that odd, as much of the bill aligns with Obama’s plan for NASA, including defunding Constellation and promoting a new rocket system&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, I want to point out that Obama’s plan, and this bill, funds private space concerns (like SpaceX, which is preparing to launch its Falcon 9 rocket which will be man-rated and capable of flights to the space station). You’d think Republicans would support this, as they have a mantra of privatizing health care, social security, and so many other government efforts. However, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/07/senator-kay-bailey-hutchison-r-tex-disses-private-space/"&gt;many Republicans don’t like private space companies&lt;/a&gt;. An exception I must note was Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), who spoke up about funding private space efforts and how important it is. On most issues he and I disagree strongly, but on this one we agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/uscapitol-300x225.jpg" alt="uscapitol" title="uscapitol" width="300" height="225"&gt;Watching the speeches on this bill (and others that came after while I waited for the votes to be counted) was certainly a lesson for me. I saw Representatives stand on the Floor and say things that were breathtakingly untrue. Of course I know this happens all the time, but to see it myself, and see it over something that concerns me immensely, made the breadth of the purely political maneuvering visceral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, watching this awful display will make me pay even more attention to what’s going on in Congress. It’s an election year, and the rhetoric will be dialed up for sure. We all must be on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m glad the bill was passed. I just wish it had been done in a more noble way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; I’ll note that while the new bill appears to me to align with much of what Obama wants, not all of it does. However, reading through it is difficult, as much of the language is in Congress-speak and confusing. Since I’m not an expert, I’m willing to entertain discussion of this in the comments. Where does the bill diverge from Obama’s plan? Besides some specifics (like rocket design) how does it modify Obama’s proposed NASA plan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the UK doctors are punished by being “struck off” the register of physicians. You may recall that the infamous Andrew Wakefield was struck off for ethics violations related to his MMR-autism Lancet study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11425435"&gt;Now we have news of another UK physician being struck off&lt;/a&gt; – this time for prescribing stem cell treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Dr. Robert Trossel was found by the General Medical Council (GMC) to have breached good medical practice by “exploiting vulnerable patients.” He gave stem cell treatments to several patients with MS, at a cost of about £10,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an earlier hearing, the GMC Fitness to Practise panel said that Dr Trossel had exaggerated the benefits of treatment based on “anecdotal and aspirational information”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His patients, who had an aggressive and disabling type of multiple sclerosis, paid up to £10,000 or more for stem cell injections, with some raising the money through charity events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the stem cells offered were not intended for human use, only for laboratory research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I read stories like this my irony meter is often pegged to the right, at risk of breaking. When discussing conventional, but substandard, treatments by MDs we are often given a completely rational assessment. This often includes several points taken for granted as establishing ethical science-based medicine. For example – treatments should not be based upon anecdotes alone, practitioners should not over-hype the safety and effectiveness of their treatments, vulnerable and desperate patients should not be exploited with claims that are not backed by objective evidence, and experimental treatments require full informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles are generally accepted, and we laud the system for rooting out unethical doctors who violate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the treatment being discussed is so-called “alternative” the same rules magically don’t apply. Then journalists seek out the anecdotes of patients to sing the virtues of the controversial treatment. Proponents are sought to give “balance” to the piece. There is no discussion of exploitation, false hope, squandered expense, or the need for informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Trossel is criticized because he, “exaggerated the benefits of treatment based on ‘anecdotal and aspirational information’.” In my opinion, that characterization applies to just about the entire world of alternative medicine. Almost by definition, “alternative medicine” is a loose collection of treatments that are experimental, unproven, or even disproved that are promoted by anecdotes and wishful thinking, over-hyped, and sold to the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear – I am not defending Trossel. By all reports, what he did violated basic ethics and being struck off seems like a reasonable result. He did not give proper informed consent to his patients, who were surprised to learn that the stem cell treatments included bovine material and therefore contains a small risk of transmitting CJD (the human version of mad cow disease). Even with that small but scary risk aside, there are no proven stem cell treatments for MS or any similar condition. The treatments were, at best, experimental – but they were not given as part of an approved experimental protocol. And patients should not have been charged for such experimental treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly does seem as if Trossel was exploiting desperate patients, exploiting the media hype surrounding stem cells, and charging large sums for his services. This is happening around the world, in stem cells clinics that try to lure in foreigners with false hope and dubious claims. Some patients are wealthy, but many raise funds from family, friends, and charity events, only to hand over tens of thousands of dollars to charlatans. There is a crack down on stem cell tourism, but it is still a huge problem, and I suspect that Trossel was caught in this backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, in many states in the US someone like Trossel only has to slap the “alternative” label on what they are doing and they are free from the most basic regulations of medical standards. Many states have so-called “health care freedom laws” that would prevent someone like Trossel from losing their license over such behavior. Some states have specific laws defending specific practices, like chelation therapy, or in CT there is a recent law protecting those who treat “chronic Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case lobbyists have pushed through laws, usually under the radar, that would deprive the public of basic protections so that practitioners could have the freedom to practice ethically and scientifically questionable medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trossel should follow Wakefield to the US. He can probably find a state with quack-friendly laws, and then he can go back to exploiting desperate patients for financial gain. He just has to practice “alternative” medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285853455667"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/never_underestimate_your_stude.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/525e678721d16961</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academics"/><title type="html">Never underestimate your students</title><published>2010-09-30T14:15:53Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T14:15:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/SJF5CRmjVNo/never_underestimate_your_stude.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/never_underestimate_your_stude.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/the_class_writes.php"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;, I have my upper division classes write openly on the web about the subject of the course. It&amp;#39;s good practice for being comfortable with discussing the world of ideas outside this little sheltered realm of academia, but I&amp;#39;ve always had one reservation: the internet is a cruel place, and I feel a bit protective of my students, so I send them off with lots of warnings and reassurances that I will defend their open expression of ideas and they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about differences of opinion affecting their grades. I&amp;#39;ve had students with whom I greatly disagree get online and make arguments I think are horribly wrong…but it&amp;#39;s all OK, because the purpose of this exercise is to generate discussion and debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I put them to work urging them to be brave and bold and don't worry about what other people say. And I've been &lt;i&gt;all wrong&lt;/i&gt;. I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about them…I had to worry about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I'd reviewed their blogs and the comments people had left there, and noticed they were getting a lot of not-at-all-helpful advice, fussing over style and telling them how to write their entries, and in class I started by telling them to ignore all that, I wanted them to find their own voices, when the class chuckled and pointed at the white board. A chill went down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/09/eyes.jpeg" width="200" height="316" alt="eyes.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students had gotten annoyed at the condescending tone of a few of the comments, and had decided to deal with it. On the whiteboard was written the complete personal data of one person who had irritated them: they'd traced back his posting info and had gotten his real name, home address, employment history, phone number, etc., and were sharing that information. Before I interrupted them by starting the class, they were debating whether to teach him a lesson themselves or just to post all of that to 4chan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. They've already got their own cyberpistols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t panic, I held them off and suggested they do nothing now, and that maybe there are less drastic ways to deal with obnoxious commenters, but still, it was a bit of a reversal and I learned something that you should all learn, too. These are adults in the 21st century, and they know how to take care of themselves on the internet — so don&amp;#39;t get all patronizing with them, and learn to talk with them as equals. Or else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've been taking the leashes off a fierce pack of wolves. I'm so proud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/never_underestimate_your_stude.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/SJF5CRmjVNo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285852011733"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/botanical_wednesday_its_that_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68c0db510166d8ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Botanical Wednesday: It's that time of year</title><published>2010-09-30T04:50:27Z</published><updated>2010-09-30T04:50:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/X2wfPL5lzCs/botanical_wednesday_its_that_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/botanical_wednesday_its_that_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/09/botanical_wednesday_its_that_t/japanesemaple.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="japanesemaple.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In poisoning situations (lead, aluminum, iron, etc.), chelation is medically necessary, objectively effective, and approved for use. But the same term has a completely different meaning in the alternative medicine universe, where proponents often believe heavy metal toxicity is the “one true cause” of disease, and chelation can undo microvascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, and even aging itself. From early days as an unproven treatment of coronary artery disease, its use has expanded to include autism, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and &lt;a href="http://icimed.com/books_by_members.php"&gt;dozens of other diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Today, chelation is widely available. Regrettably, my own profession, pharmacy,  facilitates this pseudoscience by manufacturing and selling chelation products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provoked urine tests are a common entry point to chelation therapy. Patients are given a product to provoke heavy metal excretion. The urine is tested and the patient is informed that they’re “toxic” and require chelation. Unfortunately, these results are &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html"&gt;meaningless&lt;/a&gt; and provide no evidence that chelation is medically necessary. But that’s the justification used for advocating a treatment regimen that will be useless at best and &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/chelationtherapy.html"&gt;fatal&lt;/a&gt; at worst. A recent &lt;a href="http://secure.medicalletter.org/cannotaccess?ac=1&amp;amp;a=1347c&amp;amp;t=article&amp;amp;n=11025&amp;amp;p=tml&amp;amp;title=Nonstandard%20Uses%20of%20Chelation%20Therapy&amp;amp;i=1347"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Medical Letter&lt;/cite&gt; review&lt;/a&gt; concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical Letter consultants believe that the use of chelation therapy in non-standard protocols for unsubstantiated indications should be discouraged. The results of provoked urine testing are not an acceptable basis for such treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing chelation to patients isn’t a straightforward matter. It’s typically an intravenous infusion (though there are some oral products). Unless you’re part of the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438277/?tool=pubmed"&gt;dubious TACT trial&lt;/a&gt;, which has administration centres across the United States and Canada, there are few products &lt;em&gt;commercially&lt;/em&gt; available. For example, edetate calcium disodium (EDTA) is approved for sale in the United States but not Canada. Edetate disodium (also called EDTA) is not approved for sale in either country. But these products are widely available: they’re manufactured by pharmacists in pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that many decades ago, almost all prescriptions were custom manufactured, or compounded. The pharmacist combined raw chemicals into dosage forms like capsules, tablets, liquids and creams. Compounding allows complete customization of a prescription — from a new strength of a capsule, to a liquid form of a tablet, to creams with combinations of ingredients that can be completely individualized. With the proper equipment, even sterile injectables can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, commercial manufacturers supply most drug products, and the need for in-pharmacy compounding has dwindled. At the same time, regulatory oversight, by agencies like Health Canada and the FDA, ensure product uniformity, purity, potency, efficacy, and safety standards for consumers. However, any pharmacy is still capable of providing compounded prescriptions, and some specialize, calling themselves “compounding pharmacies” and aggressively promoting the service. In compounding pharmacies, the same level of regulatory oversight and scrutiny does not exist. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pccarx.ca/"&gt;Professional Compounding Centers of America&lt;/a&gt;, provides training, formulations (recipes), and raw ingredients to compounding pharmacies. To pharmacies and pharmacists, compounding is a business opportunity, and an ideal way for independent pharmacies to compete against large chain stores, which typically do not offer these services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between compounding pharmacies that prepare chelation treatments, and the practitioners that prescribe these products, is a symbiotic one — each group needs the other to offer these treatments. Consider this article in a pharmacy publication, entitled, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pharmacytimes.com/issue/pharmacy/2005/2005-01/2005-01-9117"&gt;Chelation for Antiaging: The Pharmacist’s Role&lt;/a&gt;, which touts the benefits of chelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing toxic metals from the body is one of the most important antiaging therapies available. The results from many scientific studies indicate that an increased accumulation (body burden) of toxic metals—such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic—increases the risk for common diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious toxic-metal problems must be managed by an experienced physician. It is becoming increasingly recognized, however, that virtually everyone has a chronic accumulation of toxic metals in the body, which contributes to health problems and accelerates the aging process. Pharmacists who take the time to become knowledgeable about the correct use of OTC detoxification products can provide a much-needed service. At the same time, guiding customers on detoxification protocols also can become a new source of income for pharmacists who charge for their consultation time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a huge, burgeoning, evidence-free marketplace that pharmacies have stepped in to fill. College Pharmacy in Colorado has a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.collegepharmacy.com/ASD.asp"&gt;“Hot List” of chelation protocols&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-treatments-nov22,0,7095563,full.story"&gt;DAN! protocol&lt;/a&gt; — all of which can be ordered. Dallas-based ApothéCure offers a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.apothecure.com/heavy_metal_detox.php"&gt;huge list of intravenous chelation options&lt;/a&gt;. Quantum Pharmacy in San Francisco touts a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.quantumpharmacy.net/chelation.html"&gt;long list of benefits&lt;/a&gt; from EDTA infusions. Smith’s Pharmacy in Toronto &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smithspharmacy.com/retailer/store_templates/am_custom_page.asp?pageID=788&amp;amp;storeID=A2CA0A52C8E242409B8D577B01E035A1"&gt;offers chelation&lt;/a&gt; among a number of biomedical treatments for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no evidence to support its use, why the persistent interest in chelation? Despite anecdotal evidence of success, my sense is chelation is simply another &lt;a href="http://www.skepticnorth.com/2010/08/the-spooky-pull-of-sympathetic-magic/"&gt;manifestation of sympathetic magic&lt;/a&gt;: specifically, contagious magic. Patients remove these non-existent “toxins” and become “cleansed” through a sciencey-looking purification ritual that is repeated dozens of times. With no objective measurement of efficacy, protocols and treatment measurements vary widely, but typically lack a defined endpoint. According to the &lt;em&gt;Medical Letter&lt;/em&gt;, regimens of 20-50 infusions are common, at costs of $100-$300 per treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have had difficulty finding a balance between allowing the legitimate practice of individualized compounding of products to meet unique patient needs, and the desire to limit pharmacy compounding as a workaround to prepare products that are pointedly not approved for use, or are used as a means of commercially selling products that require FDA evaluation and approval for sale. The FDA has &lt;a href="http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/comp/index.shtml"&gt;taken action against a number of pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; who have been alleged to contravene federal food and drug regulations. There’s been little action from pharmacy regulators themselves against these practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for patients, a network of pharmacies continues to facilitate the provision of compounded chelation therapies, in the absence of any persuasive evidence to support their use. That state and provincial pharmacy regulators ignore these activities is an embarrassment to the profession of pharmacy, and consumers quite literally are paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;

But because many other issues arise in this discussion than are addressed in the &lt;a href="http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2010/09/27/dr-ben-santer-and-chris-mooney-on-communicating-climate-science/"&gt;video that I posted&lt;/a&gt;, I want to continue by addressing some additional points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first: &lt;em&gt;How important is it for climate scientists, beyond being good researchers, to also be good communicators?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say very important–and some already are great communicators.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Alley, for instance, is very dynamic, and very entertaining. (Just click&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NQPolcYoIc&amp;amp;feature=fvw"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t believe me, to see his Milankovich cycle dance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently listened to &lt;a href="http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/holland/"&gt;Greg Holland&lt;/a&gt; of NCAR do a radio satellite tour to talk about the 2010 hurricane season, sponsored by the Project on Climate Science. He did a great job being personable, getting the facts across, in different media markets across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: Singling out these two individuals does not mean that they're the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; good climate science communicators--they're just two good examples.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many researchers don’t have these natural skills–and many don’t have the time or training to let them design a message, think about creative ways of delivering it, consider its timing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of them can do the following. They can think, from the outset of a particular research project, about how it is going to be communicated. And they can work with communication professionals—here’s the money issue, those people need to be available—to come up with a strategy the professionals can then execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can, and should, be a division of labor in most cases when it comes to the communication roles. The problem is that while we’ve got lots of great researchers in the scientific world, there is really not much of an identity for professional science communicators—and not much career prospects, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 2: &lt;em&gt;How can climate scientists communicate on this issue without crossing the line and being seen as “advocates,” or losing their objectivity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are working in a politicized area, as a scientist, you should know from the outset that anything you say is going to be given greater scrutiny, and even that you might well be attacked &lt;em&gt;baselessly&lt;/em&gt;—not because you’ve done anything wrong, but simply because it serves someone’s strategic or political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, scientists can’t flinch from communicating—but they need to go in with open eyes. In particular, being objective and careful about what you say, not getting baited into needless conflict, sticking to what &lt;em&gt;you know needs to be gotten across&lt;/em&gt;, is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another point here. In a politicized area, scientists are always going to be accused of advocating for policy positions, and going beyond their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of dealing with this is to take the route of the old Office of Technology Assessment—provide a range of &lt;em&gt;options &lt;/em&gt;based on the science, rather than explicitly taking a position in favor of one particular policy. Thus, you could talk about why the science shows that global warming is going to keep worsening if we don’t take action, but that doesn’t mean you’re endorsing a carbon tax or cap and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respecting this line between describing a problem on one hand, and advocating particular legislation to solve it on the other, should go a long way towards inoculating against criticism–or at least, the kind of criticism that actually sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have another blog about climate science communication next week….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scitech.org.au/about-scitech/news/featured-news/876-discover-the-science-of-attraction-at-the-next-after-dark"&gt;Scitech is gearing up for a very sexy After Dark&lt;/a&gt;.  Get ready as we spice up the next installment of After Dark with the science of attraction and a special guest appearance from internationally respected sexologist and relationship expert, &lt;a href="http://www.drgabrielle.com/"&gt;Dr Gabrielle Morrissey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that if you’re not familiar with the science of sexology, you should check out the interview done with international sexologist &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605238&amp;amp;comments=on"&gt;Dr Petra Boynton on the Skeptic Zone podcast #78&lt;/a&gt;, and also the &lt;a href="http://courses.curtin.edu.au/course_overview/postgraduate/sexology"&gt;research offerings by one of the local universities here in Perth, Curtin University:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Curtin University Sexology teaching and research program was established in 1978, by Professor Rosemary Coates, &lt;a href="http://www.publichealth.curtin.edu.au/html/news_feature.cfm#555"&gt;has continued to lead the way in Sexological education and   research in Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an item mentioned by Derek Colanduno on Facebook, regarding &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100928083844.htm"&gt;science, attraction and appeal of women across cultures- from Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists have conducted a comprehensive study to discover how  different body measurements correspond with ratings of female  attractiveness. The study found that across cultural divides young, tall  and long armed women were considered the most attractive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also linked to &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5651462/brain-scams-the-real-science-behind-sex-differences"&gt;this review on I09 of a new book by Cordelia Fine ‘Delusions of Gender’&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s claimed that she debunks  the “neurosexist” myths of evolutionary psychology – I guess I was initially more interested in the summation about intuition, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain differences may also be behind a female-leadership problem-solving  style: when a female leader “knows what to do, she’s not as worried as a  man might be about proving it with data.” Gurian and Annis suggest that  “[o]ne reason for this intuitiveness may be that she has a larger  corpus callosum connecting both hemispheres of the brain.” By contrast,  male leaders favor a problem-solving style that, in part, “relies on  more linear data and proof.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Female intuition’ and whether it does or does not exist has been a subject of endless fascination for me (Skeptic Zone podcast &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=479160#"&gt;interview with Professor Bruce Hood&lt;/a&gt; and one for Token Skeptic with &lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/04/06/episode-fifteen%E2%80%93on-womens-intuition-and-myths-in-psychology/"&gt;Dr Scott Lilienfeld&lt;/a&gt;), and delves more into the pseudoscientific tales about ‘how women are’. But there’s also the paranormal claims that appear – that women are more likely to pick up on ’spirits’ and ‘visions’… which leads me to this story from Australia’s Northern Territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Northern Territory  woman who claims to have been pulled out of bed by a ‘horny ghost’ that  haunts her house says she has no plans to get rid it.&lt;br&gt;
Jennifer Mills-Young, 47, who lives near Darwin, has become a media  sensation after claiming her home is haunted by a ghost she calls Kevin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first ghost tale that she has touted – as one &lt;a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/the-other-side/horny-ghost-kev-spooks-housewife/story-e6frfhk6-1225932077127"&gt;newspaper reported,&lt;em&gt; ‘Mrs Mills-Young said she was the “worst sceptic” when it came to ghosts.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She certainly enjoys writing about them – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.trueghosttales.com/paranormal/growing-up-haunted-in-sydney-part-22/"&gt;‘Growing up Haunted in Sydney Part 22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‘, for example!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being notorious about my experiences of growing up haunted (see previous stories) I find people tend to tell me things…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching the internet, I can find her &lt;a href="http://www.trueghosttales.com/paranormal/growing-up-haunted-in-sydney-australia/"&gt;accounts ranging from December 2009 to now&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href="http://www.bestofalltopics.com/ghost-boy-followed-me-from-tasmania/"&gt;few examples of her advising people who claim to be haunted&lt;/a&gt; (’I’m in Darwin and may have had someone follow me from Sydney!’), &lt;a href="http://www.trueghosttales.com/paranormal/tag/jennifer-mills-young/"&gt;telling tales of friends’ experiences&lt;/a&gt; and even her &lt;a href="http://www.trueghosttales.com/paranormal/growing-up-haunted-in-sydney-australia/"&gt;belief that the women of her family have these kinds of premonitions on a regular basis.&lt;/a&gt; This just may be the first time she’s had media attention, rather than just internet-based readers, leading to the news-splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind, popping ‘&lt;em&gt;horny ghost&lt;/em&gt;!’ into any media report is bound to liven up an ordinary week of reportage… What a pity she’s called him ‘Kevin’ rather than a ‘Byron’ or ‘Lothario’ or ‘Desiderio’ – it sounds more like he’d be the kind of ghost who’d be haunting your beer fridge, quite frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, people who are interested in investigating the paranormal speak up – &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/strangebuttrue/sydney-ghost-hunter-offers-to-investigate-kevin-the-randy-poltergeist-20100930-15yp1.html"&gt;‘Sydney ghost hunter offers to investigate Kevin the randy poltergeist’&lt;/a&gt;. The site of the investigator mentioned,&lt;a href="http://www.unexplainedaustralia.com"&gt; Murray Byfield&lt;/a&gt;, features the statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our aim is to conduct professional investigations which are professional in nature and yeild positive results.” [sic]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an &lt;a href="http://www.paranormalfieldinvestigators.com/heiroglyphs.html"&gt;interview with Byfield about his investigations&lt;/a&gt; indicate a slightly more skeptical than accepting nature (always to be encouraged!). His work on ‘what exactly are the &lt;span&gt;Gosford Glyphs’ indicated that they are not of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Egyptian origin at all, although I’m not too sure about his use of EVP meters when investigating ghostly sounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In regards to young people testing an urban myth about a ‘ghost rider’ in the Hunter Valley – the &lt;/span&gt;‘Lemon Tree Passage Ghost’, he says that he suspects it’s just lights from other cars, rather than encourage the practice that young people are engaging in, with dangerously fast speeds on a country road:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIECmT27y8Y"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIECmT27y8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my own part? I hope that a few Australian skeptical groups contact Ms Mills about her experiences. I’d also suggest that people check out the excellent summation about &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/oct/02/sleep-paralysis"&gt;sleep paralysis that was printed in The Guardian by Dr Chris French&lt;/a&gt;, which very much taps into the ’sexy ghost invasion’ that people sometimes indulge in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope to see if I can blog about the experience of visiting the SciTech event, without any fears of paranormal intervention!&lt;/p&gt;

Ever.It&amp;#39;s a fairly known fact around these parts that [unicellular] forams can devour [multicellular] animals. But thus far we&amp;#39;ve just had giant tree forams like Notodendrodes show us the terrifying force of microbial nature. Notodendrodes is notably bigger than its prey, so the embarrassed metazoa have an excuse there. As for giant planktonic forams – well, those eat things only slightly larger than themselves, you may say. In which case you must be almost insatiable. But, as usual, there&amp;#39;s more: rather small, unassuming Ammonia tepida devouring nematodes, copepods and gastropods unarguably larger than itself.Like other forams, Ammonia uses its amazing reticulopodia (lit. &amp;quot;net-feet&amp;quot;) to trap and entangle prey. Then, it penetrates its prey&amp;#39;s exoskeleton or cuticle and forcefully rips apart the insides to shreds, bringing back phagocytosed chunks towards the main cell body for digestion. This process is creepy enough to warrant its own term: skyllocytosis (Bowser 1985 J Prootozool). All that&amp;#39;s left behind is an empty cuticle with a hole. By the way, the prey are devoured within 24 hours. And apparently forams are pretty much always hungry. Imagine being violated by masses of dynamic and powerful net-like pseudopodia and torn to pieces from the inside. Doesn&amp;#39;t sound fun. Feels good to be big, doesn&amp;#39;t it?Ammonia tepida vs. nematodes. c and d show before and after shots of one such encounter. Sometimes a second foram joins for a threesome. (Dupuy et al. 2010 J Foram Res)As for copepods...the following sentence from the paper raises some concern: &amp;quot;Despite vigorous attempts to escape, copepods could not free themselves from the pseudopodial mesh.&amp;quot;(Dupuy et al. 2010 J Foram Res) Most of us have seen copepods one time or another. For the world of their scale, they&amp;#39;re quite strong. And yet they cannot escape. Neither can snails, whose shells are all that remains after a few hours.  Have I mentioned foram reticulopodia are simply amazing?Ammonia tepida vs. copepod (a) and juvenile snails (b,c). Note how the copepod is partially eaten already towards the right. d,e - SEM view of the ventral (umbilical) end of the foram. Little bumps (pustules) are thought to potentially act as &amp;#39;teeth&amp;#39; and used to grind tests and cuticles. Some other forams are thought to do this with diatoms as well. (Dupuy et al. 2010 J Foram Res)You may wonder how foram pseudopodia get to be so special. They possess many unique properties, many of which have yet to be understood. One of the more striking features is the rate of microtubule growth. @font-face {   font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; }@font-face {   font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;; }@font-face {   font-family: &amp;quot;Wingdings&amp;quot;; }@font-face {   font-family: &amp;quot;ArialMS&amp;quot;; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; }h1 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Times; }h2 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; }h3 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; color: blue; }h4 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; }h5 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; color: blue; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; }h6 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; color: blue; font-style: italic; }p.MsoHeading7, li.MsoHeading7, div.MsoHeading7 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid; font-size: 16pt; font-family: ArialMS; color: blue; }p.MsoBodyText, li.MsoBodyText, div.MsoBodyText { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times; }p.MsoBodyText2, li.MsoBodyText2, div.MsoBodyText2 { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; color: blue; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }ol { margin-bottom: 0in; }ul { margin-bottom: 0in; }While microtubules of animal cells grow at about 1-15µm/min, microtubule assembly in some forams can reach a stunning 12µm per second (Bowser &amp;amp; Travis 2002 J Foram Res). They manage this by possessing a unique third conformation of tubulin: helical filaments (in addition to the usual protofilaments/&amp;#39;tubes and free dimers).Transformation of tubulin between helical filaments and free dimers appears to require no ATP, and thus would progress quite rapidly. Furthermore, tubulin of helical filaments can transform directly to the tubules, much faster than regular polymerisation from free dimers. The idea is that tubulin is stored in helical form (crystalised, if you will), and then transported to the site of active growth, and used for a quick and efficient supply of the growing &amp;#39;tubes with fresh tubulin (Welnhofer &amp;amp; Travis 1996 Cell Motil Cytosk). Thus, it is perhaps not overly surprising that foraminiferan tubulins are highly diverged, suggesting selective pressure for the foram-specific modifications (Habura et al. 2005 MBE). This is yet another example of bizarre alterations by a protist of typically conservative aspects of eukaryotic biology.SEMs of foram pseudopodia entrapping prey; in this case, Artemia.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While [Tufts Freethought Society] services the needs of its current membership through weekly meetings and the sponsorship of lecture series, its club status limits its ability to accommodate the needs of the broader non?religious community. &lt;strong&gt;The establishment of a Humanist chaplaincy at Tufts would provide non-religious Tufts students an organizational infrastructure and legitimacy greater than what TFS can provide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enrolling Student Survey of the Class of 2012 reported that of the nearly 60 percent of students who responded to the question concerning religious affiliation, over 30 percent marked “none.” While not all of these non?religious students would utilize the services of a Humanist chaplaincy, it is likely that a Humanist chaplaincy would see a rate of participation similar to other chaplaincies on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We freethinkers desire one place on campus that can serve as a hub for secular guidance, philanthropy and community.&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of a university-supported Humanist community will not only provide a resource for students to contemplate secular answers to traditionally “spiritual issues,” but it will also allow the secular worldview to have a valued social presence equal to that of the other belief systems present on our campus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to knock on Humanist chaplains as being too “spiritual” or touchy-feely — hell, I know I’ve said that before — but as I’ve gotten to talk more with &lt;strong&gt;Greg Epstein&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;John Figdor&lt;/strong&gt; who run the &lt;a href="http://harvardhumanist.org/"&gt;Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve learned more about the possibilities of that position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the building of a local community for non-religious people.  There’s programming events that might be of interest to atheist students.  (The Harvard folks have events going on &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. When I was in college, I was lucky to do something interesting with my atheist group once a month. Twice? That was pushing it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of counseling they do is incredible. There really aren’t a lot of professionals you can talk to about issues like the death of a loved one, an upcoming wedding, or an addiction you’re battling that don’t involve the mention of a higher power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanist Chaplains are like fire extinguishers.  I’ve never had the need to use them, but many other people have, and it makes me feel better knowing they’re close by.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if religious chaplains are given a place at the table, it’s only fair that Humanist chaplains be included as well.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have a look at an especially horrible little beast from the parasite department. Parasites come in all shapes and sizes, but what’s most interesting about the best of them is the jaw-dropping life cycles that some of them have developed. &lt;em&gt;Leucochloridium paradoxum&lt;/em&gt; (aka the green-banded broodsac) is one of my favorite examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little fellow is a flatworm that lives inside birds, and subsists off of their bodies from the inside out. It has developed a neat trick for getting the next generation of little flatworms into other birds. There’s one way out of a bird: through its droppings. The problem is that birds don’t typically eat other birds’ droppings, so at first glance, this seems to be a poor choice for spreading one’s seed.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are other things out there that do eat bird droppings. &lt;em&gt;Leucochloridium paradoxum&lt;/em&gt; puts its larvae into the bird’s droppings, where they sit and wait for an unlucky snail to come along. Snails are quite fond of bird droppings, and so they eat them up, along with the broodsac larvae. Once inside the snail, the larvae grow into sporocysts, which are big long tubes containing dozens or even hundreds of little flatworms. The sporocyst grows inside the snail, most obviously up into its eyestalks. Horrifically, the sporocyst pulsates in such a way that the eyestalks look almost like barber poles, flashing bright horizontal bands of color to attract — you guessed it — birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bird comes along, thinks the snail’s eyestalk is a caterpillar, and nips it off. The bird is thus full of broodsac flatworms, which then live out their normal lives until it’s time to reproduce, and the cycle starts over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While infected, the snails can still see, although not very well. They’re no longer really able to discern light from dark, and so they end up out where they shouldn’t be, out where birds can see them more easily. And, of course, once their eyestalks are bitten off by birds, they can’t see at all.&lt;/p&gt;

PES have traditionally been conceived and applied in contexts where the providers of the service are populations (as opposed to industrial companies) – fishermen, farmers, forest dwellers....the compensation paid to the commercial sector benefiting from rights granted by society (government or local authorities) is at best questionable.

This is a narrow and somewhat naive perspective. The largest PES markets are government mandated and mediated programs in the developed world, such as the  U.S.&amp;#39;s Conservation Reserve Program.  The recipients of PES in these cases are mostly large-scale landowners with industrial-size operations, and more recently wetland and habitat bankers.  These actors are essential to getting PES to a scale where it can make a real difference.

The authors do make some good points as to issues that need to get worked out, though, particularly with large-scale international carbon trading through REDD programs.

Concessions on public lands - Companies are extracting PES out of public lands on which they have been granted logging rights or other leases.  Countries need to clarify what rights they retain to land they lease.  It would be best international bodies that set standards for carbon trading, set limits on the types of concessions that companies can use to generate income from PES.  

Polluter pays - It has been a long standing pillar of environmental policies that the polluter should pay the cost of their environmental degradation.  PES somewhat flips this idea on its head when landowners are paid to not damage the environment.  In purely economic terms, there should be no difference - a landowner is loosing money by foresaking this income.   The real problem is one of access - the programs will be more efficient and equitable if they are scaled up and widely accessible.

&amp;quot;Use Restricting&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Asset Building&amp;quot; PES - The authors draw a distinction between &amp;quot;use restricting&amp;quot; payments that merely prevent environmental degradation and &amp;quot;asset building&amp;quot; programs that explicitly use PES to drive sustainable development.  It&amp;#39;s an interesting contrast, but two thoughts come to mind.  First, sustainable development aid needs broader and better funding sources than PES, which are probably too restrictive for real holistic development programs.  Second, this dichotomy ignores a broad spectrum of in-between possibilities that would be ideal for private sector involvement, particularly large scale restoration programs.

George Lucas is preparing &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; release of all of his Star Wars movies, after yet again tweaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new versions will be in…&lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i677c428c4dc16c2c7592835d50e86a3a"&gt;cheesy post-processed pseudo-3-D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the first one was released back in 1977 it was phenomenal — a pulpy space opera with dialogue that had the panache of a Hugo Gernsback short story, and we liked it. Then came the sequel, and we were overjoyed…it was still good old fashioned science fiction, but it was &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than the first.  And from that point on, unfortunately, it was dissolution and decay, beginning with the Ewoks and ending in the terminal embarrassment of Jar Jar Binks. Yet Lucas keeps tinkering with the sell-out garbage, trying to restore that brief moment of magic by hammering it all flatter and paving it over with a virtual steamroller of reprocessing and rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing will save them, George. They were badly conceived and badly written, and yet another digital makeover will not change that fact. Maybe if you'd written them competently when you made them, you wouldn't be masturbating their corpses now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/i_think_im_hoping_the_world_do.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yFvmtiKjrh0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285814539443"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=202509">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7908fd1ef9066310</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="climate change"/><category term="environment"/><category term="environmental conservation"/><category term="gender-differences"/><category term="women"/><category term="womens-issues"/><title type="html">Is Climate Change a "Women's Issue"?</title><published>2010-09-29T21:41:36Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T21:41:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/is-climate-change-a-womens-issue/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="86531158" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/09/86531158.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="375"&gt;Al Gore might be the best-known spokesperson for environmental activitists, but according to a recent study, &lt;a href="http://www.rodale.com/climate-change-facts?cm_mmc=DailyNewsNL-_-2010_09_29-_-Top5-_-NA"&gt;women are the biggest champions of environmental responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. The study followed men and women’s opinions about climate change — whether it was happening, and whether it was humans fault, among other things — between 2001 and 2008, and found that over the time period, women have become the smarter sex when it comes to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, 35% of women worried about climate change a “great deal” over the eight-year period,  compared with just 29% of men. Women also showed greater smarts about the topic: 59% of women believed that the effects of global warming have already taken hold, while just 54% of men did. They also were more likely to believe that human pollution is the main cause (64% of women feel humans are responsible; only56% of men do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though researchers expected that motherhood would make women more likely to increase awareness about the issue, they didn’t actually find a difference between working women and mothers’ knowledge or beliefs.  The lead researcher, Aaron McCright, PhD (an associate professor of sociology at the Lyman  Briggs College at Michigan State University) concluded that women are all socialized to be more empathetic and caring than men, leading them to exhibit more concern and curiosity about environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Do you know more women who care about climate change than men? Do you think women are raised in a way that makes us more concerned for “Mother Earth”? Tell us in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

She tasted the porridge from the first bowl. 
&lt;br&gt;
'This porridge is too hot!' she exclaimed.
&lt;br&gt;
So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.
&lt;br&gt;
'This porridge is too cold,' she said.
&lt;br&gt;
So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.
&lt;br&gt;
'Ahhh, this porridge is just right,' she said happily and she ate it all up." -&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dltk-teach.com/rhymes/goldilocks_story.htm"&gt;Goldilocks&lt;/a&gt; and the Three Bears&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Life as we know it on Earth all makes great use of one particular molecule in one particular phase:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/great-barrier-reef-home.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/great-barrier-reef-home-thumb-500x219-56425.jpeg" width="500" height="219" alt="great-barrier-reef-home.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liquid water!&lt;/b&gt;  Having a liquid phase to water requires an atmosphere with enough pressure (and something with even 1% of Earth's atmosphere will do it), but it &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; requires &lt;a href="http://math.nyu.edu/~gladish/teaching/eao/week2.html"&gt;the right temperature&lt;/a&gt; to be a liquid.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is important!  Water in its solid phase doesn't really lend itself -- in our experience -- to the flourishing of successful lifeforms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/img_1198122828_15383_1227245972_mod_745_745.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/img_1198122828_15383_1227245972_mod_745_745-thumb-500x500-56427.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="img_1198122828_15383_1227245972_mod_745_745.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's the same deal at the other extreme: water vapor -- water in gaseous form -- doesn't have the same properties as &lt;i&gt;liquid&lt;/i&gt; water.  And we don't know of any lifeforms that make use of water vapor for vital biological processes the way they do with liquid water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's what happens if the temperature gets too hot: liquid water boils and goes into a gaseous phase.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/lobster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/lobster-thumb-500x375-56429.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="lobster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Although it makes life &lt;i&gt;taste&lt;/i&gt; delicious, it doesn't, in our experience, make life from scratch.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as far as we know -- which isn't all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; far -- the Earth is the only planet with liquid water on its surface, and the only planet with life on it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/Nasa_blue_marble.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/Nasa_blue_marble-thumb-500x512-56431.jpeg" width="500" height="512" alt="Nasa_blue_marble.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth has the right temperature range for its pressure -- between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius at 1 atmosphere -- for liquid water to exist in vast quantities.  What's more, is that Earth has had these conditions for &lt;i&gt;the entire 4.5 billion year lifetime&lt;/i&gt; of our Solar System!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are some other worlds that &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; have had liquid water once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/venus.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/venus-thumb-500x382-56433.jpeg" width="500" height="382" alt="venus.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus, for example, is estimated to have had the right conditions for liquid water for about the first 300 million years of the Solar System.  But the atmosphere got too thick, and the once-Earthlike temperatures skyrocketed.  Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on.php"&gt;extreme greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt; it experiences, the average temperature on Venus is now about 500 degrees Celsius, which is &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; too hot for liquid water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/mars_atmosphere.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/mars_atmosphere-thumb-500x561-56435.jpeg" width="500" height="561" alt="mars_atmosphere.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; is true for Mars!  Despite being so much farther away from the Sun, Mars is still close enough that, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it had an Earth-like atmosphere, it probably had liquid water on its surface for more than a &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; years!  (Dried up riverbeds seem to support this.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with most of its atmosphere lost due to the solar wind, Mars is now a frozen wasteland, with no liquid water on the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as you know, we are not limited to the Solar System, and each shining light in the night sky holds the promise of a possibly habitable world!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/Exoplanet.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/Exoplanet-thumb-500x386-56437.jpeg" width="500" height="386" alt="Exoplanet.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one of these stars in the night sky, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_581"&gt;Gliese 581&lt;/a&gt; (which I've written about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/say_hello_to_my_little_rocky_f.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/the_gliese_system_addendum.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is now known to have &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/uoc--ndp092810.php"&gt;six&lt;/a&gt; planets orbiting it, the latest of which is the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/29/earth-like-planet-gliese-581g"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/earth-like-planet-life.html"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why's that?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/phot-15b-09-fullres.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/phot-15b-09-fullres-thumb-500x340-56439.jpeg" width="500" height="340" alt="phot-15b-09-fullres.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because every star has what we call a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone"&gt;habitable zone&lt;/a&gt; (or Goldilocks zone) around it, where the temperature is &lt;i&gt;just right&lt;/i&gt; for a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere to have liquid water!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you guess why we're excited about this latest, &lt;i&gt;sixth&lt;/i&gt; planet orbiting Gliese 581?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the/500px-Habitable_zone-en.svg.png" width="500" height="305" alt="500px-Habitable_zone-en.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, not only it is a &lt;i&gt;rocky&lt;/i&gt; planet like Earth, but because it's &lt;i&gt;smack in the middle&lt;/i&gt; of its habitable zone!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this doesn't mean that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/29/possible-earthlike-planet-found-in-the-goldilocks-zone-of-a-nearby-star/"&gt;this planet has life on it&lt;/a&gt;, or even liquid water, but it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; make it the best known candidate outside of our Solar System.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it's the &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; great candidate, and it's only &lt;b&gt;20 light years away&lt;/b&gt;!  (The &lt;i&gt;closest&lt;/i&gt; star outside of our Solar System is already over 4 light years away, so this really &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; that far!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think that probably about 10-20% of all stars have planets in their habitable zones, but this is the &lt;i&gt;first time&lt;/i&gt; this scientific idea has been verified outside of our own Solar System!  What's the next step?  The next step, of course, is to build a good enough telescope with a spectrometer (or a differential brightness mechanism to look for clouds) to look for signatures of liquid water on this world; but I think this step is totally one worth celebrating!  Pretty soon, it'll be time to call the new &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/27/alien-ambassador"&gt;alien ambassador&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/09/a_planet_with_liquid_water_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285808552815"><id gr:original-id="http://www.ascientificnature.com/2010/09/29/guppy-sex-a-soap-opera-of-seduction-and-sneak-matings/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d56b0cb475228b6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Guppy Sex…A Soap Opera of Seduction and Sneak Matings</title><published>2010-09-29T18:40:20Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T18:40:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/vgh4YMoVQwE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.ascientificnature.com/2010/09/29/guppy-sex-a-soap-opera-of-seduction-and-sneak-matings/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Finding and (and then convincing) a female to mate with you is hard enough.  Just look how much trouble that young, muscular, attractive male guppy above is having.  Then you have to worry about your sperm being beaten out by the sperm of ugly rapists.

&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin wondered if animals were aware of themselves. Allowed to visit a rare orangutan in the London Zoo, he &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SOiEo1tEnsoC&amp;amp;lpg=PR22&amp;amp;ots=nYXSOHLPgb&amp;amp;dq=charles%20darwin%20jenny%20mirror&amp;amp;pg=PR22#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=mirror&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;brought a mirror&lt;/a&gt; and observed the ape apparently make faces at its own reflection. It’s hard to say for sure that the orangutan really was aware that its reflection was its own. Over a century later, a scientist named George Gallup turned Darwin’s idea into a more rigorous test. He would secretly put a mark on an animal’s forehead and see if it noticed the difference the next time it passed a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human adults pass this test, but young children don’t, suggesting that our self-recognition takes time to develop. Some chimpanzees (our closest relatives) seem to pass this mirror test, but others fail it. Orangutans also show mixed results. Beyond the primates, studies have indicated that magpies, dolphins, and elephants pass the mirror test. In a &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012865"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS One, Luis Populin of the University of Wisconsin publish what may be the first compelling evidence that monkeys pass the mirror test too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a surprising result because people have tried to find evidence of self-recognition in monkeys before. Most scientists failed. The Harvard primatologist Marc Hauser claimed in 1995 that the cotton-top tamarin could pass the mirror test, but that paper was one of several that Harvard now claims were &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/09/20/harvard_misconduct_case_casts_shadow_over_other_research/"&gt;tainted by Hauser’s misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. Populin and his colleagues came across their first clues of self-recognition by accident. They had implanted electrodes in the skulls of rhesus monkeys for a different study. They keep mirrors in the monkey cages just to stimulate the animals, and they noticed that the monkeys started spending a lot of time looking at themselves in the mirrors after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if the monkeys were really aware that their appearance had changed, the scientists put different mirrors into the cages. Some were big and some were small. Some were made of ordinary glass, while others were painted glass. The monkeys looked much more often into the real mirrors than the blackened ones. The scientists then introduced an even bigger mirror into the cages, which allowed the monkeys to see their whole bodies. The mirror hung from the top of the cage so they could turn it around. The video above shows a monkey without an implant inspecting one of these big mirrors. It doesn’t use any of the gestures it might if it met another monkey. Instead, it seems to be inspecting its body. Every nook and cranny, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked two experts on self-recognition, Lori Marino and Frans de Waal, both of Emory University, what they thought of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino was enthusiastic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve been reading this article over and over again all morning and have looked at the videos.  Here is my reaction: I think that this is potentially a very important study.  The videos are absolutely convincing. At first I thought it was the saliency of the implanted head device that made a difference but the videos show that monkeys without the device also use the mirror and, even more importantly, the monkeys are using the mirror to explore OTHER parts of their bodies, i.e. genitals.  That can’t be explained away in some sort of ’stimulus saliency’ explanation, as far as I can tell.  There are two areas that I wish I had more information about. First, exactly what was their prior mirror exposure?  Is there anything they can report about how long that was and if there were any interactions with the monkeys during that prior time that could have made a difference in terms of the outcome of this study? Second, they report that the monkeys “failed the mark test” but there is no information given about the methods used in the mark test.  It would be important to know how that was conducted. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all that said, this is – by far – the most compelling evidence for MSR in monkeys to date. I have been trying to find an alternative explanation for the results – and haven’t come up with one yet. I’ll continue to return to it to see if any come to mind.  I think that these findings show that self-awareness is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon as Gallup has asserted.  I don’t find this conclusion particularly surprising because it has been extremely difficult for anyone to come up with an explanation for the supposed “discontinuity” between great apes and monkeys.  I think the reason for this is that there is none.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Waal was more circumspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is hard to say what is going on as the cap may be seen as a “supermark,” as the authors call it, but it is of course a mark that is not only seen but also felt. As a result, the monkeys have two sources of feedback at the same time, the image in the mirror and the sensation of something new on their head. This is different from the classical mark test, which has only one source of information (visual). It seems clear that the convergence of these two sources of perception is helpful to achieve self-inspection, and this is an interesting finding, but the authors still need to explain why rhesus monkeys apparently cannot do the same with just the visual information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hallmark of the mark test is its spontaneity, purely on the basis of visual input, so in this sense this is different. Rhesus monkeys have been tested many times and never pass the test. I think you need to talk to Dr. Gordon Gallup and see what he thinks. It is unclear to me what to conclude, but this study is quite different from e.g. the magpie study, which applied a purely visual test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea that mirror self recognition is a black &amp;amp; white distinction (you either have it or you don’t) was first challenged in another monkey study that we conducted, in which we showed that capuchin monkeys do not seem to see a stranger in the mirror: they seem to distinguish the monkey in the mirror from another monkey, strange or familiar. As a result, we proposed a gradual scale of self awareness. The piece of intriguing information presented here may support this view, but I am sure many scientists would want more tests and more controls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: New Scientist &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19518-monkeys-bid-to-join-elite-selfawareness-club.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Gallup shares De Waal's reservations.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Peter Roma, who published a &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20404/abstract"&gt;2007 paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he failed to find evidence for self recognition in monkeys, rejects the new one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although the video samples are provocative, I cannot agree with the conclusion (and title) of the paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of social behaviors towards the mirror is irrelevant because the monkeys all had an extensive history with mirrors prior to the study, so there was no reason to expect social responses after years of habituation to reflective surfaces.  To anthropomorphize, they may still think the monkey in the mirror is another animal, but over the years they've learned that he's harmless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples of putative genital viewing were not convincing either.  The authors repeatedly asserted that the monkeys used the mirrors to view areas they could not see directly, but monkeys can see their genitals unaided, and they play with them all the time with or without mirrors!  Even the video samples show the monkeys looking at their genitals directly then viewing the same area(s) in the mirror.  This is why scientists do the mark test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the most compelling evidence was the first video of the monkey touching the head implant while holding the mirror.  There is no doubt that the monkeys could not see the implant without a reflective surface, but the key here is whether or not this self-examination behavior occurred more frequently in the presence of the mirror vs. without.  The authors report increased incidence of touching "unseen" areas in the presence of the mirror (figure 2C), but these data include touching the cranial implant and the genitals.  I suspect these data are artificially inflated by what the authors perceive as mirror-guided genital examination, which even in the video examples did not appear to be anything more than typical stereotyped "acrobatic" behaviors often seen in individually-housed rhesus monkeys.  The authors provide no data on the frequency of just cranial implant touching with vs. without mirrors, and no visual evidence except for the single incident from the video.  Why wouldn't they report the number of implant explorations independently of the genital viewing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary concern is that all monkeys failed the mark test, and the strongest apparent evidence of mirror self-recognition (MSR) was only seen in two monkeys following cranial surgery--a manipulation with strong tactile cues that could elicit exploration regardless of the mirror's presence.  Their argument rests largely on the assertion that the cranial implant is a "super mark" that somehow awakened a latent ability in the monkeys to self-recognize, but it's unclear why the implant would be more visually salient than a brightly contrasting color marking on the face.  The more parsimonious conclusion is that the tactile sensation of the implant was enough to elicit exploration, but even then, the authors provide no evidence that implant exploration occurred more frequently in the presence of the mirror vs. without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the authors' hypothesis is true that a cranial implant serves as a "super mark," then their procedures warrant replication, which frankly they should have done before making such a bold assertion.  Currently within the Order Primates, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence still limits MSR and the fundamental cognitive precursor to a "sense of self" to the apes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This back-and-forth is not just interesting in itself, both for what it says about monkeys and what it says about ourselves. It also says something about science. If you read some of the more extreme comments about the Hauser affair, you'll find some people trying to indict the entire line of research into how human and animal minds evolved. This new paper, and its reception, shows just how absurd that radical rejection is. Science is bigger than individual scientists, and the mirror test will survive.&lt;/p&gt;

That in itself is cool news; a planet like that is very hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the amazing thing is that the planet’s distance from the star puts it in the Goldilocks Zone: the region where liquid water could exist on its surface!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/gliese581c.jpg" alt="gliese581c" title="gliese581c" width="609" height="468"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a few things: 1) Gliese 581 is a dinky, cool red dwarf about 20 light years away. That’s pretty close as stars go; only a handful are closer. Bear in mind it’s still 200 trillion kilometers (120 trillion miles) away, and that’s still a bit of a drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~vogt/ms_press-1.pdf"&gt;The planet is one of six now known to orbit the star&lt;/a&gt; [that link goes to a PDF of the journal paper]. Apparently, all the planets have neat, circular orbits, so the system seems to be stable. This new planet takes 37 days to orbit the star once, and orbits at a distance about 1/6 the distance of the Earth from the Sun. As far as we know, it’s the fourth planet from its star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The planets have all been found by the Doppler method: as they orbit the star, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/29/a-tiny-wobble-reveals-a-massive-planet/"&gt;they tug on it&lt;/a&gt;. This causes a shift in the wavelength of emitted light from the star. The mass of the planet, its distance from the star, and the shape of the orbit all determine how the light shifts, which is how astronomers found those properties of the new planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so that’s what we know. Now let me be clear here about stuff we can be fairly sure about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re too close to a star, it’s too hot to support liquid water. If you’re too far, it freezes. This defines a rough region from the star — the Goldilocks Zone, for obvious reasons — where liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet. This depends on the star, of course, but also on other factors like the planet’s atmosphere; Venus could have liquid water, but its super-thick atmosphere produces a runaway greenhouse effect which has heated it to 460° C (900° F). If Mars had a thick atmosphere, it might support liquid water! So the planet itself matters here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gliese 581g, as the new planet is called, is in the zone where the temperature is just right. And with a mass of just three times that of the Earth, it’s unlikely to be a gas giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, this does not mean the planet is habitable, or even very Earthlike.&lt;/strong&gt; It may not even have any water on it at all. For now, we can’t know these things, so beware of any media breathlessly talking about life on this planet, or how we could live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things we can speculate on with some solid footing. The orbital period of 37 days puts it pretty close to the star – since the star is a red dwarf, it’s cooler than the Sun, so being closer doesn’t necessarily mean you overheat. But it does mean the star exerts strong tides on the planet, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/tides.html"&gt;which have the effect of slowing the planet’s rotation until it equals the orbital period&lt;/a&gt;. This has almost certainly happened to this planet, so in other words, one day on this planet = one year, and the planet always shows the same face to its star like the Moon does to the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes things a bit dicier for habitability. The side facing the star may get very hot, while the dark side gets very cold. If the planet has an atmosphere that gets mitigated somewhat (the hot air on the day side will flow over to the night side and vice versa, smoothing out the highs and lows in temperature), and may make the planet more clement. However, we have no clue if this planet has an atmosphere at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to note that the mass found (3x Earth) is the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; mass of the planet! It may be more massive, though it’s unlikely to be much more. The Doppler method doesn’t give an exact mass, only a lower limit. That’s frustrating, but that’s the way the math works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that one of the other planets, Gliese 581d, orbits farther out but if it has a thick atmosphere like Venus it may also be able to support liquid water on its surface. All in all, this could be a very interesting system to study!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most interesting and exciting aspect of all this is what it implies. The Milky Way galaxy is composed of about 200 billion stars, and is 100,000 light years across. The fact that we found a planet that is even anything like the Earth at all orbiting another star only 20 light years away makes me &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; optimistic that earthlike planets are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; in our galaxy. 20 light years is practically in our lap compared to the vast size of our galaxy, so statistically speaking, it seems very likely it’s not unique. I don’t want to extrapolate from a data set of two (us and them), but if this is typical, there could be millions of such planets in the galaxy. &lt;em&gt;Millions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we don’t know if this planet is all that much like Earth — the surface gravity may be quite high if it’s dense and small, for example, or it may not have any air, or it may have a thick atmosphere like Venus — but what it’s telling us is that smaller, lower mass planets at the right distance from their star for liquid water are almost certainly common in the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s big enough news for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atheists who have some comprehension of religion and how its  ideological system works should rightfully be proud, as proud as  atheists satisfied with knowing naturalism alone. And all atheists  should be encouraged to put their knowledge to good use. Those atheists  who want to publicly engage believers in civil discourse will admirably  support the rational and naturalistic worldview, and probably open up  more cracks of doubt in believers. There is no reason at all to just  assume, as a few atheists do, that  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-shook-phd/for-atheists-and-believer_b_715546.html"&gt; no intellectual engagement with religion is possible &lt;/a&gt; or worthwhile. As I repeatedly urge, atheists do have the superior  worldview and our intellectual leadership from Richard Dawkins to Daniel  Dennett and many more, too numerous to name, should be our role models.  Recommending some familiarity with religious thinking is no treacherous  betrayal, but wise counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists capable of guiding public discourse about religion, and  capable of showing religious people a dignified and smart way to abandon  religion’s delusions, are heroic figures in these dangerous times. We  must use every strategy possible to confront religion. From the sparks  of slashing debate to the smiles of pointed blasphemy, atheists can do  it with our wits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine and noble sentiments.  But click the link supporting his claim that “no intellectual engagement with religion is possible.”  It doesn’t link, as you might expect, to any atheists who made that claim, but to his original HuffPo article. And that article, while flinging out strong accusations of theological ignorance, doesn’t name any perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he ascribes “intellectual leadership” to Richard Dawkins?  I would have thought that Dawkins was one of the theologically benighted who inspired Shook’s original post: one of the “know-nothings” who is “proud of their ignorance.”  After all, Shook said this: “To listen to the loudest atheists, you can hear the bewilderment. And  they just can’t believe how a thing like religion could appeal to any  intelligent person.”  Who, exactly, are these “loudest atheists”?  Who is louder than Dawkins–or Hitchens?  Dawkins is, of course, the atheist most often accused of not knowing “sophisticated” theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that Shook (like Phil Plait in his “don’t be a dick” talk) won’t be forthcoming with examples of prominent atheists who are know-nothings.  I read his new article as a retraction, but not really a retraction.  Mistakes were made, but not by Dr. Shook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge Shook to name names and give examples–and not examples of a few blog commenters who don’t know theology.  Until he does so, I have little respect for the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/29/earth-like-planet-gliese-581g"&gt;A report in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/29/earth-like-planet-gliese-581g"&gt;The Guardian &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;describes the discovery of an apparently Earth-like planet in orbit around Gliese 581, a red dwarf star about 20 light years away. The key point is that Gliese 581g – as it has been romantically dubbed by the astronomers – is rocky (unlike the vast majority of exoplanets thus far discovered), it has sufficient gravity to potentially maintain an atmosphere and that it is in the “Goldilocks zone” – not so close to its sun that everything would fry, and not so far that everything would freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That having been said, I don’t think we’ll be firing up the warp drive just yet to go and colonise it. Like our Moon, Gliese 581g keeps one face permanently to the sun, the other permanently facing the sidereal gloom. In other words, it would be extremely hot on one side, extremely cold on the other and just right only in a narrow band between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Steven Vogt, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is quoted as saying “Any emerging life forms would have a wide range of stable climates to choose from and to evolve around, depending on their longitude”. This seems to be jumping the gun somewhat, given they have – literally – only the slightest glimmer to go on. A more important point made by Vogt would seem to be this: “The fact that we were able to detect this planet so quickly and so nearby tells us that planets like this must be really common.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Kagami-biraki (or kagami-wari) means "opening (or cracking) the mirror" where the "mirror" refers physically to the lid of the sake barrel and symbolically to circular mirrors depicting the sun and used as divine instruments in Japanese shinto religion. The kagami-biraki ceremony is performed at auspicious events, particularly at semi-formal and informal festivities commemorating beginnings. Participants often show camaraderie by wearing informal uniforms (happi shirts are common) instead of formal kimono.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here are some dignitaries ceremonially breaking the barrel-lids on stage last night (sorry for the low-quality cell-phone photo):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/IS_Kegger2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/IS_Kegger2.jpg" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handout continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Normally taru (barrel) sake is served by using an auger to drill a hole on the side of barrel near its bottom and stopping it with a wooden plug so that desired quantities can be drawn while keeping the sake fresh. In kagami-wari however, because the barrel lid is broken and cannot be replaced, the sake must be wholly consumed during the party. This no-holds-barred gesture signals an all-you-can-drink occasion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The untreated wooden barrels add a pleasant, cool, vigorous flavor that underscores the newness of the event. Virginity is important to the Japanese psyche. Using brand-new items was intended originally for gods and guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Today, most restaurant chopsticks are broken in half immediately before use, and unlacquered wood utensils are the most cherished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SakeCup.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SakeCup.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The "cups" distributed for drinking the sake were boxes freshly made out of some highly aromatic wood, perhaps cedar, which added an intense aroma and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll report later on some of the research results that I learned about at the meeting.  But drinking sake out of cedar-wood boxes, under a religious obligation to finish the keg, was certainly one of the more striking ideas that I've encountered so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285795176008"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=5462">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf48da4a36ffb7d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Seriously, The Laws Underlying The Physics of Everyday Life Really Are Completely Understood</title><published>2010-09-29T15:51:55Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T15:51:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/aSLPDvLgslQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/09/29/seriously-the-laws-underlying-the-physics-of-everyday-life-really-are-completely-understood/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;While the primary purpose of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/09/23/the-laws-underlying-the-physics-of-everyday-life-are-completely-understood/"&gt;last week’s post&lt;/a&gt; on the laws of physics underlying everyday life was to convey information like a good blog post should, there was another agenda as well: to test the waters.  This is an issue I’ve been thinking about a lot lately, but I wanted to get a better idea for how it’s perceived in the outside world.  I honestly wasn’t sure whether there would be more of “you arrogant physicist, we don’t have any idea what the laws are” or “you moron, why are you wasting our time with this self-evident crap?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for that ambiguity.  Responses, for example at &lt;a href="http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=5645231&amp;amp;cpp=1"&gt;Fark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/diuuo/the_laws_underlying_the_physics_of_everyday_life/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; but even here in our very own comment section, displayed a greater than average internetitude, defined as a tendency to not read the article, set up straw men, and miss the point.  But at least the direction of disagreement was fairly uniform.  The issue under discussion is important, so it’s worth taking the time to counter the three most common arguments, from completely silly to almost-sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Are you serious? There’s so much we don’t understand: turbulence, consciousness, the gravitational &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-body problem, photosynthesis…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which my years of academic training have prepared me to reply: duh.  To conclude from my post that I was convinced we had a full understanding of any of those things represents, at a minimum, a rather uncharitable reading, given that no one in their right mind things we have such an understanding.  Nevertheless, I knew people would raise this point as if it were an objection, which is why I was extra careful to say “We certainly don’t have anything close to a complete understanding of how the basic laws actually play out in the real world — we don’t understand high-temperature superconductivity, or for that matter human consciousness, or a cure for cancer, or predicting the weather, or how best to regulate our financial system.”  And then, at a risk of being repetitive and boring, I added “Again, not the detailed way in which everything plays out, but the underlying principles.”  And for emphasis there was something about “the much more jagged and unpredictable frontier of how the basic laws play out in complicated ways.”  Nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction I’m drawing is between the laws underlying various phenomena, and how the phenomena actually behave, especially on macroscopic scales.  Newtonian gravity provides an excellent example of the difference: we certainly know the laws underlying the behavior of gravitating particles in the Newtonian regime, but that obviously does not mean we have a complete solution to the &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-body problem, or even a qualitative understanding of how large collections of particles behave.  It’s the difference between knowing the rules by which chess is played, and being a grandmaster.  Those are not the same thing.  In particular, taunting “you’re no grandmaster!” is not actually a refutation of the claim that I know the rules of chess.  My claim was that we know the basic equations governing the behavior of matter and energy in the everyday regime — not that we have a complete understanding of every observable phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course completely legitimate not to &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; that we know the basic underlying laws.  You may not think that’s interesting, or very important.  That’s fine, I certainly wasn’t making any claims at all about priority or importance or interestingness.  But it should still be possible to understand the claim I was making, and judge it on its own merits, such as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just emphasize how non-trivial the claim is.  First, that there is such a thing as an “underlying” set of laws.  That is, that we can think of everyday objects as being composed of individual pieces, such that those pieces obey laws that are the same independently of the larger context.  (Electrons obey the same equations of motion whether they are in a rock or in a human heart.)  That’s the reductionist step.  Again, for people who enjoy taking offense:  this is not to say that the reductionist description is the only interesting one, or to imply that the right way to attack macroscopic problems is to reduce them to microscopic ones; only that the microscopic laws exist, and work, and are complete within their realms of validity.  And second, that we know what those laws are.  There’s nothing in the everyday world that is inconsistent with Standard Model particles obeying the rules of quantum field theory, plus general relativity to describe gravity.  Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. We don’t even understand gravity!  And the Second Law of Thermodynamics!  And quantum mechanics!  (&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/f-cking-magnets-how-do-they-work"&gt;Magnets! How do they work???&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous objection, this one is not correct-but-misplaced, it’s just wrong.  But it’s wrong in an interesting way.  We actually do understand gravity:  it is described by Einstein’s general relativity.  Not deep down at the quantum level, of course, but that’s very far from the world of the “everyday.”  You might try to make some profound epistemological claim that we don’t &lt;em&gt;really understand&lt;/em&gt; gravity, we just have a set of rules that it unambiguously obeys.  Fine; I would argue that this isn’t an especially helpful distinction in this case, but in any event it’s beside the point.  What I meant was that we have a clear set of rules that are unambiguously obeyed.  That’s also true for the Second Law — it was explained by Boltzmann.  Sure, we have to invoke a low-entropy boundary condition at the Big Bang, but guess what?  The Big Bang is not within the realm of our everyday experience.  Even the collapse of the wave function, which comes closest to a true mystery, doesn’t qualify.  For one thing, wave function collapse isn’t something you see happening in your kitchen on an everyday basis.  But more importantly, we do have a theory that describes what happens, handed down to us by Bohr and Heisenberg.  You might think that this theory is unsatisfying and incomplete, and I would be extremely sympathetic.  But it fits all the data we have.  I’m not trying to make a deep philosophical point about the meaning of “understanding”; just noting that things obey laws, and in the everyday regime we know what those laws are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You’re too presumptuous.  New physics might be required to understand consciousness, or wave function collapse, or…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes closest to an actual argument, and I wish that the entire conversation could have focused on relatively sensible points of this form.  But ultimately, I don’t buy it, not even close.  Take consciousness as an example.  Obviously there are a lot of things about the workings of the human mind that we don’t understand.  So how can we be so sure that new physics isn’t involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we can’t be &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s not the point.  We can’t be sure that the motion of the planets isn’t governed by hard-working angels keeping them on their orbits, in the metaphysical-certitude sense of being “sure.”  That’s not a criterion that is useful in science.  Rather, in the face of admittedly incomplete understanding, we evaluate the relative merits of competing hypotheses.  In this case, one hypothesis says that the operation of the brain is affected in a rather ill-defined way by influences that are not described by the known laws of physics, and that these effects will ultimately help us make sense of human consciousness; the other says that brains are complicated, so it’s no surprise that we don’t understand everything, but that an ultimate explanation will fit comfortably within the framework of known fundamental physics.  This is not really a close call; by conventional scientific measures, the idea that known physics will be able to account for the brain is enormously far in the lead.  To persuade anyone otherwise, you would have to point to something the brain does that is in apparent conflict with the Standard Model or general relativity.  (Bending spoons across large distances would qualify.)  Until then, the fact that something is complicated isn’t evidence that the particular collection of atoms we call the brain obeys different rules than other collections of atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be a refutation of my claim that we understand the laws underlying everyday phenomena?  Easy:  point to just one example of an everyday phenomenon that provides evidence of “new physics” beyond the laws we know.  Something directly visible that requires a &lt;em&gt;violation&lt;/em&gt; of general relativity or the Standard Model.  That’s all it would take, but there aren’t any such phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A century ago, that would have been incredibly easy to do; the world of Newtonian mechanics plus Maxwell’s equations wasn’t able to account for why the Sun shines, or why tables are solid.  Now we do understand how to account for those things in terms of known laws of physics.  I am not, as a hopelessly optimistic scientist from the year 1900 might have been tempted to do, predicting that soon we will understand everything.  That’s an invitation to ridicule.  Indeed, we know lots of cases where the known laws of physics are manifestly insufficient:  dark matter, dark energy, electroweak symmetry breaking, the Big Bang, quantum gravity, the matter/antimatter asymmetry, and so on.  We might answer all these questions soon, or it might take a really long time. But these are all rather dramatically outside our everyday experience.  When it comes to everyday phenomena that are incompletely understood, from consciousness to photosynthesis, there is every reason to believe that an ultimate explanation will be obtained within the framework of the underlying laws we know, not from stepping outside that framework.  An impressive accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of Bedbug-Gate ‘10, a new bug is rolling into town: The &lt;a href="http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/think-bedbugs-are-bad-say-hello-to-stinkbugs.html"&gt;stinkbug&lt;/a&gt;. And, true to its name, it smells awful. You might find them on your walls either in or outside your home. They can’t hurt you, and they don’t cause any health problems — but experts say they’re here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you get rid of these smelly bugs? Vacuum them up and then dispose of the vacuum bag ASAP. You can also try a messier method: Smash one of the bugs. Its smell will cause the other bugs to scatter. We’d recommend wearing a face mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk show host &lt;a href="http://tv.gawker.com/5647213/wendy-williams-breaks-down-in-tears-over-kevin-federlines-hoarding-problem"&gt;Wendy Williams&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationalenquirer.com/"&gt;The National Enquirer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is alleging that &lt;a href="http://www.popeater.com/tag/Britney+Spears/"&gt;Britney Spears’&lt;/a&gt; ex-husband, &lt;a href="http://www.popeater.com/tag/Keven+Federline/"&gt;Kevin Federline&lt;/a&gt;,  is a hoarder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her show, Williams tearfully reported that Federline’s neighbors have  said that the celebrity’s garage is filled with garbage, including old  appliances, used diapers and a fish tank full of dead fish. She  suggested that his condition may be blamed on his celebrity status and  the fear that the paparazzi may search through his trash to dig up  tabloid dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the allegations of hoarding are true, could the pressure of celebrity  life — possibly tied to his public battle with the bulge — be the  reason for this former backup dancer’s alleged problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Celebrities are no more susceptible to hoarding than anyone in the  general population,” Dr. Jeff Szymanski, executive director of the &lt;a href="http://www.ocfoundation.org/"&gt;Obsessive Compulsive Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,  told AOL Health. “Hoarders have serious problems making decisions; they  feel overwhelmed by responsibilities, and they have strong emotional  attachments to their belongings. Being a celebrity may make someone  paranoid, but it has nothing to do with being a compulsive hoarder.”&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1"&gt;The Lay Scientist by Martin Robbins at The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a news website article about a scientific paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the standfirst I will make a fairly obvious pun about the subject matter before posing an inane question I have no intention of really answering: is this an important scientific finding?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph I will state the main claim that the research makes, making appropriate use of “scare quotes” to ensure that it’s clear that I have no opinion about this research whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph I will briefly (because no paragraph should be more than one line) state which existing scientific ideas this new research “challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the research is about a potential cure, or a solution to a problem, this paragraph will describe how it will raise hopes for a group of sufferers or victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph elaborates on the claim, adding weasel-words like “the scientists say” to shift responsibility for establishing the likely truth or accuracy of the research findings on to absolutely anybody else but me, the journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph I will state in which journal the research will be published. I won’t provide a link because either a) the concept of adding links to web pages is alien to the editors, b) I can’t be bothered, or c) the journal inexplicably set the embargo on the press release to expire before the paper was actually published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Basically, this is a brief soundbite,” the scientist will say, from a department and university that I will give brief credit to. “The existing science is a bit dodgy, whereas my conclusion seems bang on,” she or he will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then briefly state how many years the scientist spent leading the study, to reinforce the fact that this is a serious study and worthy of being published by &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;the BBC&lt;/span&gt; the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a sub-heading that gives the impression I am about to add useful context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I will state that whatever was being researched was first discovered in some year, presenting a vague timeline in a token gesture toward establishing context for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pad out this section I will include a variety of inane facts about the subject of the research that I gathered by Googling the topic and reading the Wikipedia article that appeared as the first link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will preface them with “it is believed” or “scientists think” to avoid giving the impression of passing any sort of personal judgement on even the most inane facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fragment will be put on its own line for no obvious reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph I will reference or quote some minor celebrity, historical figure, eccentric, or a group of sufferers; because my editors are ideologically committed to the idea that all news stories need a “human interest”, and I’m not convinced that the scientists are interesting enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;At this point I will include a picture, because our search engine optimisation experts have determined that humans are incapable of reading more than 400 words without one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/9/24/1285359869220/spacedino.png" alt="This is a picture" width="460" height="331"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;This picture has been optimised by SEO experts to appeal to our key target demographics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This subheading hints at controversy with a curt phrase and a question mark?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will explain that while some scientists believe one thing to be true, other people believe another, different thing to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph I will provide balance with a quote from another scientist in the field. Since I picked their name at random from a Google search, and since the research probably hasn’t even been published yet for them to see it, their response to my e-mail will be bland and non-committal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research is useful”, they will say, “and gives us new information. However, we need more research before we can say if the conclusions are correct, so I would advise caution for now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the subject is politically sensitive this paragraph will contain quotes from some fringe special interest group of people who, though having no apparent understanding of the subject, help to give the impression that genuine public “controversy” exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will provide more comments from the author restating their beliefs about the research by basically repeating the same stuff they said in the earlier quotes but with slightly different words. They won’t address any of the criticisms above because I only had time to send out one round of e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph contained useful information or context, but was removed by the sub-editor to keep the article within an arbitrary word limit in case the internet runs out of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final paragraph will state that some part of the result is still ambiguous, and that research will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;The Journal (not the actual paper, we don’t link to papers).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#3366ff"&gt;The University Home Page (finding the researcher’s page would be too much effort).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The background to the complaint made against him by a scientologist is &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/07/meaning-of-stupidscientology.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The complaint against him was dismissed yesterday.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/TKOOIDQyyNI/AAAAAAAAAVo/mZfL4k-CyO8/s1600/stupidscientology.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:200px;height:200px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/TKOOIDQyyNI/AAAAAAAAAVo/mZfL4k-CyO8/s320/stupidscientology.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know the first part of this is going to sound a bit like an Oscar acceptance speech, but there are some people that I just have to thank before I start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bel (or Mrs D) has been through this with me since the start. She's an intensely private person, who hates my being in the public eye, but puts up with it anyway. All this attention has been a bit wearing for her, and required some very delicate cooking on my part to win her round again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Allen Green, aka Jack of Kent - prior to his taking an interest, it just was me trying to convince Bel that this was a ridiculous case, and assuring her that it would all work out. Afterwards, all of a sudden, I had a lot of other people saying the same thing, which made life a touch easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, the councillors in Cardiff Council too - to a man and woman, they've been supportive. This has been an issue beyond party political boundaries. During the whole time, not one of them has tried to gain any short-term advantage, although there have been a few wry comments in debates. It'll probably halve my number of followers, but I think the vast majority of councillors in the UK are decent people who've made the choice to stand up and do something about the problems they perceive, rather than just sit in a pub and complain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could see that yesterday. It was pretty obvious that the members of Cardiff's Standards and Ethics Committee wanted to get rid of the complaint at the first opportunity they had, having been required to investigate by the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They agreed with me that, irrespective of my Twitter handle at the time, it was clear to any but the most cynical, that the context of the messages made it evident that I was writing the posts in question in a private, rather than official capacity, so the Code of Conduct did not apply. At that point, there was no further case to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I have to admit that part of me a little sad. I would have enjoyed my day in court, and I would have liked the opportunity to test the Ombudsman's judgement (which you can read in full &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/98OlPh"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the one member of Standards and Ethics who spoke against dropping the complaint there and then did so only because they wanted to hear the evidence in more detail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having being accused of religious bigotry, I would have liked the chance to defend myself. To be honest, I wanted to know on what grounds the Ombudsman can say that I both don't understand the Code of Conduct, and why they felt the need to 'note' that I showed no remorse for my actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given my responsibility for social services in Cardiff, providing services for the most vulnerable people in the city, I wanted to explore why, given the history of the 'Church' I was expected to apologise to an organisation with a long history of court judgments detailing family breakup, and also of the mistreatment of people with mental illnesses and complex developmental disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd rate myself as a fair bar-room lawyer, and a pretty decent speaker, and I've watched Twelve Angry Men, and every episode of Rumpole of the Bailey. So that part of me feels as though these things will never now get said, or recorded as part of the canon of Code of Conduct cases, so they can never apply in similar cases in future. All that happened yesterday was to decide that a councillor doesn't act as a councillor 24/7/365, and that we're entitled to express views in a private capacity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I can't blame Standards and Ethics - ultimately it was the right decision to drop the complaint, even if I would have preferred the result to have had more of an effect on the wider system. None of them really wanted to be dealing with this case, or could even understand how a complaint so trivial could have made it so far through the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Paul Chambers has probably been thinking the same thing for a while too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of us are guilty of no more than a darkish sense of humour and a compulsive desire to share an ephemeral thought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But compared to him, I've been lucky - I've not been arrested, charged, and convicted, I've not lost my job, I've not had my career destroyed, there have been no calls for me to stand down as an executive member, or as a councillor. For me, bar the odd fraught conversation at home and random applause at occasional meetings, my life has been pretty much as per usual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm embarrassed to be referred to as a 'hero' - like Paul, I stumbled unwittingly into this situation, rather than chose a battle to fight, but if anything he's the one who's responded heroically. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's the one who deserves your admiration for the way he's conducted himself under extraordinarily trying circumstances. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I did was not say 'sorry' when I was asked to on Newsnight, which seems so trivial by comparison. As I tweeted last night, if you haven't done so already - actually, even if you have done so already - take a moment now to go and contribute to the &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com/xsq9pzkg2"&gt;Twitter Joke Trial Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll still be here when you get back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unexpected side effect has been my rapid elevation to 'skeptical heavyweight'. Probably the most enjoyable part of my experiences this year has been to provide a bit of help and advice to Rhys Morgan in his campaign against the pushers of 'Miracle Mineral Solution' - an industrial bleach that AltMed advocates claimed would cure his Crohn's Syndrome, as well as any of the near endless list of conditions, like HIV, malaria, influenza, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, he might have had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to him, the UK Food Standards Agency, has issued warnings, as has the health ministry of the Kenyan government is aware that this snake oil is being peddled. As I've said to him, saving hundreds if not thousands of lives in Africa is not a bad thing to have ticked off your list of things to do before you're 16.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another opportunity has arisen to reform the regulation of local councillors. It's maybe not as sexy or important as libel reform, but as David Allen Green accurately summarised "we seem in the United Kingdom to be in the counter-intuitive position that our locally-elected representatives have a narrower right to free expression than either their voters or Members of Parliament." Or Welsh Assembly Members, Members of the Scottish Parliament, Members of the Legislative Assembly or Members of the European Parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That can't be right. Don't get me wrong, the Code of Conduct is a set of values that I signed enthusiastically, and aspire to daily. But the Ombudsman's judgement and its literal interpretation of my duty of respect puts no limits on that duty, so it's an absolute one. That means the logical conclusion is that I must respect the Klu Klux Klan or Al-Qaeda. The judgment does allow that I should not be restricted from challenging those views, but that I must do so respectfully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that's another thing that I'm going to be taking up in Wales, across political parties at a pretty high level - the future role of the office of the Ombudsman. I suspect that, come the Welsh Assembly election next year, we'll be seeing a common position on the need for reform in the manifestoes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the main result of all of this has been an increased focus on the activities of the 'Church' of Scientology, and that brings me to last night's Panorama. Ooh I should be on telly with a seamless segue like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original, "Scientology and me", from 2007 was part of my required watching as I was preparing for my hearing, along with the archive &lt;a href="http://www.xenutv.com/blog/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so I was looking forward to the follow-up. If things hadn't gone my way earlier, I was hoping for ideas for my defence at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First I have to say I think it was brave of John Sweeney to return to the subject, given the hell he was put through in the first documentary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, it felt like the documentary he wanted to be able to make the first time around. Following Twitter at the same time, I saw plenty of comments from people feeling disappointed, and wanting new information and, if truth be said, I was feeling the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a start I would have liked to see the background to their recent history in France - Aude-Claire Malton's case and the fraud trial last year, Alain Stoffen's book "Voyage To The Heart Of Scientology", how Martine Boublil was treated for her mental illness, and the death of Gloria Lopez. And that's just in France, so there's plenty of new material that could have been used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we need to remember that, outside our own echo chamber, in a world obsessed with the superficial, where superstar Scientologists enthusiastically talk up the 'Church', John Sweeney needed to re-establish a bit of credibility over the evidence he's providing following his 2007 outburst. The wider world probably has only what I had before Mr Wood's complaint last December - no more than a feeling that something isn't quite right with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think "The Secrets of Scientology" went a long way to strengthening the foundations for concern in wider society. We now know that he wasn't paranoid in 2007 - I think most of us thought he was right to suspect he was being followed constantly, but Mike Rinder confirmed how they operate against their critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike Rinder explained how, rather than discuss and debate any issues of concern raised, they provoke and search for emotional buttons to press. How they harass and intimidate - evidenced by their performance at the hospital while he was waiting for the birth of his child, unwittingly recorded by John Sweeney who he was on the phone to at the time. How they use records collected in confidence against their former members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this, and more, showed how they react in a way that no reputable organisation, never mind one that purports to be a religious one, would do. But then they do retain Carter-Ruck as their lawyers in the UK - please feel free to draw your own conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If things are to change in the UK, then that evidence base has to be firmly established in the public mind. Politicians do need convincing too. This will only be one of a huge number of subjects that people expect them to be both expert and passionate about, so for it to be more than just the issue du jour there needs to be both solid evidence of harm, and a sustained, widespread opinion that action needs to be taken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd have preferred this to be at least a three-part mini-series, so that John Sweeney could have the time to really get into his subject. If you've got to spend time establishing the history of the 2007 documentary, and showing how you'd been manipulated into your outburst with the help of one of the then protagonists, an hour goes by pretty fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can only hope that the BBC has the conviction to go deeper and further in future documentaries. I also hope they can find a someone who can put a soundtrack together that doesn't sound like they're plundering every audio cliche available. It'd also be nice if #stupidscientology could again surge to the top of the trending topics - that always fills me with a warm glow, and I know it makes David dance a little jig of excitement. Plus, I have it on good authority that every time it's used on Twitter, a body Thetan dies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this Panorama was another step, and a useful one - more confident and assured than 2007, and more convincing as a result. It's reminded me we can't stop, whether the issue is about free speech, or skepticism, or the 'Church' being "corrupt, sinister and dangerous" in the immortal words of Mr Justice Latey. Because, to borrow from my own meme, and as Gloria Lopez and many others have found, there's a lot worse than stupid that can rub off if you don't hurry past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-1114425091914166626?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285790819599"><id gr:original-id="1107 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c381a801182e117</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">You Only Get Answers to the Questions You Ask</title><published>2010-09-29T16:24:18Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T16:24:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1107" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; This simple thought seems too obvious to state, but here we go: the very approach to an issue can dictate the type of result you gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Jay Gould’s elegant essay, ‘Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples’ provides the perfect illustration. It was first published in ‘Bully for Brontosaurus’ and you’ll never regret buying an SJ Gould. So go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conundrum of the male nipple is insoluble if you ask ‘why?’ They are, after all, they are of no obvious use in males. But start with ‘how?’, and we have the more useful insight that they are specialised sweat glands whose prototypal form was present in males and females before becoming more fully developed in one sex for lactation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By publishing this article on the internet I am probably eliminating any shot I ever had at being elected President of the United States.  I’m not too concerned because living in the White House has never been my biggest goal. But, after having motivational mantras drummed into my head for 12 years of public school, and even after three years here at Bates, it’s disheartening to realize, that no, I can’t always “be all I can be.” Sadly, sometimes achievement has more do with who you are than what your human potential is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… If I’m ever running for any elected office or nominated for any federal position, some Fox News reporter or conservative senator will find the above printed words and use them to shoot me down.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, you can write just about anything &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   Simone talks about how atheism has made her a better, more compassionate person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fully convinced that if more people came out as atheists, the negative perception of us would start to disappear.

In a recent &amp;quot;see-living-donation-is-safe&amp;quot; piece of propaganda from Johns Hopkins transplant surgeons, this little nugget is buried deep within the Comment section: &amp;quot;...Reported surgical mortality of approximately 260 per 10,000 casesfor nondonor nephrectomy.&amp;quot;A quick rehash: the transplant industry continues to claim the official mortality/death rate of living donors is 3 per 10,000 or .03%. This (loosely) translates into 1-2 living donor deaths per year*. 3 -&amp;gt; 26.   That&amp;#39;s a big honking difference. Unfortunately this is quite similar to the accepted overall hepatectomy (liver removal) rate of 4% while the living liver donor mortality rate is cited as much lower. It begs the question: why the discrepancy? (or in more cyncial terms: why the lies?) The transplant industry will claim that since living donors are healthy, their mortality and morbidity (complication) rates will be different (ie lower) than other non-donor nephrectomies or hepatectomies. Certainly, the great majority of folks undergoing either procedure are suffering from some health problem deemed serious enough to warrant surgery while we are not. However, since it is considered unethical to perform surgery or organ removal on an otherwise healthy individual (except in the case of living donation, go figure), there is no way of knowing if there is a statistical difference between how a &amp;#39;sick&amp;#39; person&amp;#39;s body reacts to a surgical procedure in comparison to someone who is healthy. In the interest of true scientific validity, one simply can&amp;#39;t make claims one presupposes to be true without evidence. But herein lies the great contradiction. If we accept the transplant industry&amp;#39;s theory that living donors are their own population and not comparable to those dreaded &amp;#39;sick&amp;#39; folks, then why have they been so lacksidaisical in collecting data on us? Why have they used us for over fifty years but not bothered to even gather our social security numbers until 1994? For scientific purposes, if nothing else, wouldn&amp;#39;t they want to know everything there is to know about us in order to crow about their success as life-saving surgeons? Yet they don&amp;#39;t. They&amp;#39;ve actually resisted repeated efforts to implement a national registry (even though they&amp;#39;re quite capable of keeping one for transplant recipients and cardiac patients), and they complain whenever data collection is mandated. Now we find out they know, conclusively, the mortality risk of undergoing a nephrectomy but purposely hide it in order to make living donation sound safer than it really is. Hmm. Wonder what else they&amp;#39;re lying about. *that would be within a 90 day period following surgery. OPTN&amp;#39;s own data reveals 3.3 lilving donor deaths in the US every year within 6-months of surgery, and 4.4 within the first 12 months.

The PFC is routinely subdivided into segments, each with (presumably) a different function. So we have the &amp;quot;emotional&amp;quot; vmPFC, the &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; dlPFC, the &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot; OFC, etc.Wilson et al don&amp;#39;t dispute that there are some variations in function between different bits of the PFC, but they say that in all the excitement over localization, we may have overlooked the role of the PFC as a whole.They discuss evidence from monkeys with PFC damage. Damage to the entire PFC, they say, leaves monkeys completely unable to perform tasks which require storing concepts over time. For example, they can&amp;#39;t learn that whenever they see, say, a red button, they ought to press it to get food. But if part of the PFC is intact, and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which part, monkeys can do this with only minor problems.However, the PFC isn&amp;#39;t required for all tasks. If the task only involves information which is all presented at once, the lesioned monkeys are OK. So they could learn, given a big panel covered in red buttons, to push the buttons to get food, because the buttons are all there simultaneously.Hence the data from these tasks are congruent with the notion that [the PFC] is only crucial in memory during tasks requiring the processing of temporally complex events. This can be defined as an event to be learned about, in which information that is crucial to that learning is presented at more than one point in time, or that can only be interpreted with respect to a preceding event.They say that evidence from human neuroimaging studies supports this view.A meta-analysis has shown consistent recruitment of the same network of regions in the PFC across a range of cognitive demands. The authors argue that this supports specialization of function within the PFC, but of an unexpected nature, namely ‘a specific frontal-lobe network that is consistently recruited for solution of diverse cognitive problems’. The idea that large and different regions of the PFC are recruited by any task at hand supports our argument that the function of the PFC as a whole exceeds the sum of the functions of its subcomponents.This all has echoes of Karl Lashley, an early neuroscientist (died 1958) who proposed the theory of &amp;quot;mass action&amp;quot; - that the whole cortex contributes to behaviour, rather than each part doing different things (&amp;quot;modularism&amp;quot;).Jerry Fodor, whose classic book The Modularity of Mind (1983) helped to rehabilitate modularism from its reputation as &amp;quot;phrenological&amp;quot;, was also an advocate of this view - within limits.Fodor argued that some brain systems, like vision, hearing and language, were cortical modules, but that above this, there was a non-modular system which was the basis for thought, intelligence and decision making. If I remember correctly, he didn&amp;#39;t explicitly say that the prefrontal cortex was this system, but I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;d have no objections to Wilson et al&amp;#39;s account.Wilson CR, Gaffan D, Browning PG, &amp;amp; Baxter MG (2010).

It’s all finished!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a limited edition series of pendants to honor Carl Sagan and to help raise money for the Center for Inquiry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/4378/surlyramics.jpg" alt="Surly Sagan"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guys, I’m so &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; honored to have been part of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being a little kid and sitting on the shag carpet while my Dad watched, Cosmos. It wasn’t until years later that I actually understood what was being discussed but the beauty, wonder and awe from that television series truly impacted me and inspired me in a multitude of wonderful ways. It made me feel like there were mysteries left to unravel, adventures to take, lessons worth learning and ultimately art to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now own Cosmos on DVD and not only can I finally completely understand the concepts being discussed, it amazes me and inspires even more now!&lt;img src="http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/116/cosmos3.jpg" alt="cosmos surly" width="300" height="300"&gt; It’s pretty freakin’ fantastic that a show from 30 years ago can actually hold it’s own as far as production quality and content today. It’s still more intelligent and beautiful than most of what is aired on major networks today. Seriously, by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t watched Cosmos, I highly recommend it.  You can even &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos"&gt;watch it&lt;/a&gt; for free on Hulu. You will not be disappointed and if you play it for your children you just might raise a little scientist, astronomer or a science-enthusiast-artist of your very own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, Cosmos is just a drop in the bucket of the contributions to science and skepticism made by the late-great Carl Sagan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thanks to all the nice folks at CFI and to Ann Druyan for allowing me to create art to honor a skeptical hero. Please check out all the exciting &lt;a href="http://centerforinquiry.net/carlsaganday"&gt;events CFI and their affiliates have planned to honor and remember Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt; and if you would like to support CFI and own a limited edition Cosmos Surly made by me, click &lt;a href="http://inquiry.myshopify.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve been quite busy over the last few weeks so I haven&amp;#39;t had much time for reading or writing. However, I am attempting to repent of my slacking ways and I came across this nice little paper investigating an aspect of the automatic pilot process.Clearly we are not in conscious control of all of our actions at all times. Some reactions – like moving our hand away when we burn ourselves on a hot stove – are instinctive, reflexive. Reflexes themselves are actually a topic of hot debate in motor control these days, and there are people in my lab (including me) doing some interesting work on long-latency reflexes, which have access to some more complex processing power than the more basic, short-latency spinal reflexes that do things such as get the limb out of danger as fast as possible.One nice example of this automaticity of behaviour is in what’s known as the double-step task. A participant reaches for a target, and during the reach the target ‘jumps’ to a different location. Without really considering what they are doing, the participant changes the reach to aim for the new target. There have been many studies that have explored various aspects of this automaticity, but the paper I’m discussing today asks the question: does stopping the automatic behaviour require more cognitive resources than letting it continue?To investigate this question, the authors used a standard target jumping double-step task. They also tried to get participants to use up cognitive resources during the reach by giving them an auditory task to do (listen to a string of numbers and identify the pairs) at the same time. Before each trial, the participant was informed as to whether they should follow the target when it jumped (GO trials) or not to follow the target and instead reach to the original position (NOGO). The results are shown in the graph below (Figure 3 in the paper):Movement corrections based on time from target jumpHere ‘dual task’ means that the participants were performing the reach and the cognitively demanding auditory task at the same time. The graph shows the percent of trials corrected vs. the time from the instant the target jump happens. Thus at 150 ms almost no corrections are seen, whereas after 300 ms a substantial proportion of trials have been corrected for in both conditions. The unsurprising result here is that in the GO trials there are many more corrections than in the NOGO trials overall – after all, participants were instructed to correct in the GO trials and not in the NOGO trials.The interesting result is in the grey NOGO traces. There are substantially more corrections in the dual task than in the single task, implying that the extra cognitive load imposed in the dual task actually stopped participants from inhibiting their corrections – whereas in the black GO traces the cognitive load has no effect. This result seems to show that it actually does take cognitive effort to stop the automatic correction than letting it continue.On the face of it this isn’t too shocking a finding. After all, if you are reacting instinctively (or in a way that reflects a high level of training) to a situation, then stopping yourself from acting that way does seem like it should take some mental effort. I know it takes mental effort for me to stop doing something extremely habitual (to quote Terry Pratchett, the strongest force in the universe is force of habit). It’s nice to see a good paper that solidifies this principle.--McIntosh RD, Mulroue A, &amp;amp; Brockmole JR (2010). How automatic is the hand&amp;#39;s automatic pilot?

I like it. I think we can still learn a lot from this sort of investigation.  The paper, by Jacquemot, Dupoux, and Bachoud-Levi (2007), reports on a patient, F.A.,  who suffered a left temporal-parietal stroke with a language profile typical of conduction aphasia: good comprehension, fluent production with occasional paraphasic errors and word-finding problems, and a significant deficit in repetition. F.A. was administered a battery of tests including:Syllable discrimination, minimal pair AX design. Performance = normal.Auditory word-to-picture matching with semantic, phonological, and unrelated foils. Performance = normal.Picture naming involving words of various length/frequency. Performance = &amp;quot;slightly impaired&amp;quot;: 84% accuracy compared to 99.7% for controls; a marginal length effect for low frequency words, but not high frequency words.Word repetition involving words of various length/frequency. Performance = mild/moderately impaired: 82.3% correct (cf. 99.7% for controls), with significant length and freq effects.Non-word repetition with items of various length and high vs. low neighborhood density. Performance = SEVERELY impaired: 35.4% correct (cf., 99.6% correct for controls), with no length/density effect.  Errors were predominantly phonemic.What does this mean?  Speech recognition systems appear to be intact (normal syllable discrimination), speech production systems are at least partially intact (only moderate deficits on picture naming and word repetition), but the link between the two systems is severely damaged (very poor nonword repetition).  Non-word repetition is a particularly sensitive metric of the link between perception and production system because you have to use the lower-level sensory (&amp;quot;input lexicon&amp;quot;) to motor (&amp;quot;output lexicon&amp;quot;) route to perform the task; you can&amp;#39;t circumvent this route by using the higher-order sensory-&amp;gt;concept-&amp;gt;motor route, which is presumably the mechanism allowing for substantially better word repetition performance.As a further test, the authors assessed word and nonword reading.  On this task F.A. showed no significant difference between words and nonwords and performed reasonably well on both (91.7% and 83.3% respectively).  Maybe with more power a difference could be detected, but clearly the word/nonword performance difference is not nearly as dramatic as with the auditorily presented stimuli in the repetition task.  In order to explain the good performance in reading nonwords, we must assume that written forms can access the &amp;quot;output lexicon&amp;quot; (motor speech systems) rather directly. This is reasonable: for example, think back to what you know about the phonological loop -- visual word forms seem to be able to gain access to this system via the articulatory mechanism.  So again, this result suggests that the motor speech system is relatively intact with damage primarily to the connection between the sensory and motor systems.Here is the model proposed by Jacquemot et al. as an explanation for F.A.&amp;#39;s performance. (Note: they believe in bidirectional sensory-motor connections, but only show the direction of the damaged link; see below):For those of you schooled in traditional aphasiology, this should look really familiar as it is essentially the Wernicke-Lichtheim model (note: I use the model depiction that Lichtheim actually subscribed to rather than the more commonly used &amp;quot;house-model&amp;quot; depiction that he actually rejected based on the directional arrows.  This depiction also accurately reflects W-L&amp;#39;s belief in distributed conceptual representations):The A-M disconnection in the Wernicke-Lichtheim model resulted in conduction aphasia (good comprehension, errors in otherwise fluent speech production), and F.A. certainly fit this profile clinically.  It&amp;#39;s amazing how right Wernicke was about so many things -- more on this in a subsequent post.  In terms of more modern models, I&amp;#39;ve argued previously that the &amp;quot;disconnection&amp;quot; is due to damage to area Spt, which we argue supports sensory-motor transformations.  The one thing I disagree with in the Jacquemot et al. paper is the claim for an asymmetry in the connections between input and output systems.  Jacquemot et al. claim that while the link between perception and production is impaired, the reverse link, from production to perceptual systems is not. They base this claim on tasks that they argue require phonological access first in the motor system and then transmission to the perception system.  One task is written word rhyme judgment, the other is picture-auditory word rhyming.  The assumption is that (i) decoding a word or picture into a phonological form can only be achieved on the motor side, and (ii) rhyme judgment is performed on the sensory side.  I&amp;#39;m not convinced either of these assumptions are true.  Jacquemot C, Dupoux E, &amp;amp; Bachoud-Lévi AC (2007).

Despite having wonderfully complex internal biochemistry and fascinating ecological interactions they are essentially, when you get down to it, a little soggy bag. Little soggy bags do not preserve all that well; when bacteria die they just break apart, and are often eaten by other scavenging bacteria which see them as just free nutrients.However some bacteria  do  fossilise, leaving behind perminant records of their existance. One of the ones that does it the best is cyanobacteria, which can form fossils in two ways. Firstly by forming little calcified shells around themselves as a product of increasing the dissolved carbon dioxide levels inside the cell:Cyanobacteria fossils - from Berkeley university pageSecondly cyanobacteria can group together with algae to form large layered mat-like structures called stromatolites. Slicing these very thinly reveals tiny cyanobacteria fossils, caught between the layers. There are stromatolytes in Australia that have been alive and growing (very slowly) for millions of years, despite looking faintly uninspiring.Maybe not quite as impressive as dinosaurs...While no other bacteria form fossils as nicely preserved as the cyanobacteria, they are capable of leaving behind visible remnants of their existence. The polypeptides of the bacterial cell wall (along with cytoplasm and some secreted lipids) can, under certain conditions, act as nucleation sites for minerals. This eventually leads to the organic cell being replaced by a little mineral cast of the bacteria. There is the possibility for quite a few artifacts with this (artifact being the scientific word for &amp;quot;result caused by the preservation process rather than the bacteria&amp;quot;) the most common one being the creation of an artificial nucleus structure. As the bacteria degrades the cytoplasm tends to clump, and the crystallisation of minerals around a cytoplasm clot can in some cases create a structure that looks similar to the structure formed by a nucleus.Endolithic bacteria that live in rocks can leave behind tiny canals in the rock surface that they bore into. These are a lot harder to find and interpretation is usually helped by the discovery of nearby alive endolithic bacteria. Bacteria have also been found trapped and mumified inside tree resin, a la the Jurassic park mosquito.Once you start getting larger organisms the bacteria have a brand new niche to exploit. Fossilised bones sometimes show the results of a bacterial infection; while the bacteria themselves are not being preserved their presence is still seen in the fossil record.Unfortunately although these glimpses are really interesting their also kind of frustrating from a biochemical point of view. They provide clues as to the lifestyles and processes within the bacteria but they are such tiny clues. Past biochemical processes are more often found inside the actual bacteria, by looking at clues in the genome and the genomes of related bacteria, than they are in the remains the bacteria leave behind.---Perri, E., &amp;amp; Tucker, M.

&lt;p&gt;Cooooool. Actually, while that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a laser, it’s a bit too low power to do any damage to our friendly Moon. But it does have enough to help NASA track satellites! It’s part of the Goddard Space Flight Center’s Laser Ranging Facility in Maryland. We know the speed of light very accurately, so if you ping a satellite with a laser beam you can time the pulses and very accurately determine the satellite’s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1768.html"&gt;In this case&lt;/a&gt;, two beams were being used to track the position of NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, one of my favorite space missions of all time (to see why, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/16/lro-completes-first-phase-of-its-mission/"&gt;check out this gallery of images I posted recently&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to work at Goddard, and I remember going to this facility once because it was a dark site from which I could try to spot a comet that happened to be passing us at the time. The laser was being used, and it was positively awe-inspiring and quite surreal to see it streaking up into the sky. And yes, they have to keep a careful eye out for airplanes and such flying past. While that beam isn’t enough to melt a satellite, it’s certainly enough to fry a pilot’s eyes! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why you don’t want sharks equipped with these things. Really, that’s just asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

— he’s the Swedish artist who was at the center of controversy in 2007 because he drew the Islamic prophet &lt;strong&gt;Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt; with a dog’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://striderweb.com/blog/images/dogbody.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://striderweb.com/blog/images/dogbody.jpg" title="MuhammadDog" width="370" height="491"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/11/its-just-a-muhammad-drawing-relax/"&gt;more about those pictures here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Vilks spoke at Uppsala University in Sweden and this is what went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JdyKmzEdHws%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His home was fire-bombed a few days after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the attacks, Vilks was &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/lars-vilks-will-get-to-finish-his-talk-2/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; a chance to return to the school to finish his talk.  I didn’t know if that offer would stand, but it looks like Vilks will be &lt;a href="http://www.thelocal.se/29288/20100928/"&gt;finishing his talk&lt;/a&gt; on October 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“That a university lecture is interrupted by violence is a serious thing, regardless of the opinion that provoked the reaction,” Folke Tersman, the head of the university’s philosophy department, said in Monday’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is incompatible with the basic values democracy is based on. It is to uphold these values that we are inviting him again,” he added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope security is ramped up and Vilks remains safe.  No one deserves the sort of treatment he’s received for unpopular opinions.  Vilks has every right to criticize Islamic beliefs in any way he chooses.  It’s the Muslim radicals who are taking things too far by responding with physical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

Be that as it may, sometimes something happens that goads me to the point where I have to comment, although reality keeps me from my usual logorrhea. Who knows, maybe that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, yesterday Brandon Thorp (who also &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/contact-the-jref/12-contacts/9-brandon-k-thorp.html"&gt;works for the JREF&lt;/a&gt;) teamed up with Penn Bullock to write a disturbing report on just how much political influence some well known anti-vaccine activists and pseudoscientists wield in the state of Florida entitled &lt;a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-09-30/news/crist-backer-gary-kompothecras-bullies-florida-health-officials/"&gt;Crist backer Gary Kompothecras bullies Florida health officials&lt;/a&gt;. It's downright scary, as Kompothecras is a chiropractor with lots of money and very strong anti-vaccine beliefs who doesn't hesitate to use his cash and connections to push a dangerous agenda that could endanger children:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This madness has got to stop. No more double talk. This should be a fairly straightforward study. I feel that there are hidden agendas going on and I will not stand by [and] let it continue!! I will not wait any longer," reads an email dated August 6 from Dr. Gary Kompothecras to Dr. Julia Gill, director of the Florida Department of Health's (DOH) Division of Disease Control.

&lt;p&gt;Coming from anyone else, the blustery email threat might be easily dismissed. But "Dr. Gary," as Kompothecras is known, is the self-styled "Rainmaker," a Sarasota chiropractor who has raised more than $1 million over the years for Senate candidate and soon-to-be ex-governor Charlie Crist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's bound to turn heads when the man known to occasionally lend his private jet to the governor uses his political clout to try to bully Florida health officials into turning over scores of the state's sealed immunization records. Especially when they're for a father-son team, Dr. Mark and David Geier, infamous for injecting autistic children with Lupron, a drug used to chemically castrate prostate cancer patients and pedophiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/09/gary_kompothecras_and_charlie_crist_tag-.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/09/gary_kompothecras_and_charlie_crist_tag-.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dhU0qZdLPHs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285779904135"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1760010090435247388">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/74c03bcf4329b870</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="&quot;Outsider Test Links&quot;" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Even Arguing Against the Outsider Test for Faith Looks Bad</title><published>2010-09-29T13:07:00Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T13:42:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/lHyWjFuGy58/even-arguing-against-outsider-test-for.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1760010090435247388/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1760010090435247388" title="21 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/09/even-arguing-against-outsider-test-for.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;We abhor someone who is supposed to decide between two parties who also has a conflict of interest. That person could be a trustee of an estate, a judge, or a principal. We want a fair and impartial judgment. We want a fair ruling. So arguing against the &lt;i&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/i&gt; is like arguing against a fair and impartial ruling. It is to argue against what is intuitively obvious to everyone else and consequently makes believers look very bad, because we abhor what they try to argue against. That is, even arguing against the OTF tells an outsider there is something badly wrong with the Christian faith.

The Pew Forum telephoned 3400 people and asked them 32 questions concerning the Bible, world religions, well-known religious figures, and “the constitutional principles governing religion in public life.”  According to the Times article, atheists and agnostics, Jews, and Mormons, with an average of 20-21 correct answers out of 32, scored significantly better than the rest of the population, even after the results were corrected for demographic factors.  The majority of people answered barely half the questions correctly, and many could not even answer questions about their own religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format was mostly multiple choice and included questions like, “Where was Jesus born? What is Ramadan? Whose writings inspired the Protestant Reformation? Which Biblical figure led the exodus from Egypt? What religion is the Dalai Lama? Joseph Smith? Mother Teresa?” Many people do not know much about their own religions either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;¶ Fifty-three percent of Protestants could not identify Martin Luther as the man who started the Protestant Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¶ Forty-five percent of Catholics did not know that their church teaches that the consecrated bread and wine in holy communion are not merely symbols, but actually become the body and blood of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¶ Forty-three percent of Jews did not know that Maimonides, one of the foremost rabbinical authorities and philosophers, was Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that this survey gives new meaning to the old rhetorical question, “Is the Pope Catholic?” But, as it happens, 82 % knew that Mother Teresa was Catholic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to read that 89 % of respondents knew that public school teachers are not permitted to lead a class in prayer. On the other hand, fewer than one quarter knew that a public school teacher is permitted “to read from the Bible as an example of literature,” and only one third knew that public schools may teach comparative religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of Panda’s Thumb tolerate a lot of ignoramuses who think they know more about biology, geology, or cosmology than the experts; it now seems that they may know less about religion than the atheists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnote: I did not read the source document, only the Times article, but one thing I noticed was that people who classified themselves as “nothing in particular” scored about 15 out of 32. If a very large fraction of these people were agnostics or atheists but did not identify themselves as such, then they would have brought down the score for agnostics or atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix: According to a graph in the Times, which I will not reproduce, average number of correct answers out of 32 questions: atheists/agnostics, 20.9; Jewish, 20.5; Mormon, 20.3; white evangelical Protestant, 17.6; white Catholic, 16.0; white mainline Protestant, 15.8; nothing in particular, 15.2; black Protestant, 13.4; Hispanic Catholic, 11.6.&lt;/p&gt;

The police officer, not busy with anything else, takes the opportunity to develop his own particular style of neighborhood relations, stops the young man's car and shakes him down.  One thing leads to another, and the young man is beaten severely.  Then, more things lead to more other things and charges are filed.  From this point forward, it is pure nightmare for the young man and his family.  Such is the nature of police-citizen relationships in pretty much every city and town in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Deprivation&lt;/em&gt; is a play about one such incident, an incident which &lt;a href="http://www.howwastheshow.com/2010/09/sleep-deprivation-chamber-at-penumbra-theatre/"&gt;one reviewer called&lt;/a&gt; "as common as rain." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a college student is brutally beaten by the police, his mother begins a campaign to protect her son from the officer who claims the boy struck first. Sleep Deprivation Chamber is the harrowing autobiographical story of a mother fighting for her son's life at the risk of her own sanity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The play is by Adam P. Kennedy and Adrenne Kennedy, directed by Robbie McCauley.  It is showing at the &lt;a href="http://penumbratheatre.org/component/option,com_penumbra/task,show/sid,15/showid,303/Itemid,54/"&gt;Penumbra Theater in Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt; until Octoboer 10th.

It provides us with a method to rigorously test our ideas to find out if they are right or wrong. We can discard bad ideas, keep good ones, and that way get ever-closer to being able to understand what the Universe is actually trying to tell us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are necessarily conservative when it comes to consensus. It takes years, decades, of testing ideas to build an agreement on what’s what. At first, many will argue against it, but eventually, as evidence piles up, the scientists will come to terms with the new idea, and use it as the default position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to global warming, that consensus has been built. The vast majority — and I do mean &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; — of climate scientists agree that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/08/03/new-study-clinches-it-the-earth-is-warming-up/"&gt;the Earth is warming&lt;/a&gt;, and while evidence is still coming in, most of these scientists agree warming is due to human causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it say when &lt;em&gt;every single&lt;/em&gt; Republican candidate running for Senate this autumn is either a denier of man-made global warming or disputing facts about it we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; are true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually quite amazing. 37 seats are up for grabs in November, and of the 37 Republicans (and their Frankensteinian offspring, the Tea Party) running for these seats, &lt;em&gt;not a single one&lt;/em&gt; supports taking any action on global warming&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read about this at &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/09/14/senate-gop-candidates-deny-scienceclimate-zombies/"&gt;Climate Progress&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/09/20/20climatewire-climate-change-skeptics-sweeping-gop-senate-75251.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the UK paper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/sep/14/republicans-senate-election-climate-sceptics"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s even more at &lt;a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/13/gop-senate-deniers/"&gt;Think Progress&lt;/a&gt; (which I found via &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/9/26/905070/-On-climate-change,-its-the-Republicans-versus-reality"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comprehensive Wonk Room survey  of the Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate finds that nearly all dispute the scientific consensus that the United States must act to fight global warming pollution. In May, 2010, the National Academies of Science reported to Congress that “the U.S. should act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and develop a national strategy to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change” because global warming is “caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for — and in many cases is already affecting — a broad range of human and natural systems.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding is shared by scientific bodies around the world. However, in the alternate reality of the fossil-fueled right wing, climate science is confused or a conspiracy, and policies to limit pollution would destroy the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit fascinates me: when a crisis comes up, that’s usually a call for technological innovation, which &lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; the economy. We have plenty of time (well, we did years ago, but the clock is ticking) to work on alternative energies and other means of slowing warming if we actually get off our butts and &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/09/13/gop-senate-deniers/"&gt;Think Progress has a complete list of what those Republican hopefuls are thinking&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an astonishing look at politicians who are toeing the party line despite overwhelming evidence — and an entire scientific community of thousands and thousands of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political demagoguery, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/09/im-skeptical-of-denialism/"&gt;denial&lt;/a&gt;, and willful blindness can quite literally doom us all. I really think it’s time we have politicians who can face the hard problems and have the courage to look ahead, instead of lamenting a past that never really existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Tip o’ the thermometer to Manotick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; To be fair, there was one guy who decided to go along with overwhelming scientific consensus and was confident global warming is real and man-made: moderate Mike Castle, who was dunked out of the race by Tea Partier Christine O’Donnell (though &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42649.html"&gt;who may yet run as an independent&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanning the thousands of hopped-up faces in the crowd, I am immediately struck by two things. One is that there isn&amp;#39;t a single black person here. The other is the truly awesome quantity of medical hardware: Seemingly every third person in the place is sucking oxygen from a tank or propping their giant atrophied glutes on motorized wheelchair-scooters. As Palin launches into her Ronald Reagan impression — &amp;quot;Government&amp;#39;s not the solution! Government&amp;#39;s the problem!&amp;quot; — the person sitting next to me leans over and explains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The scooters are because of Medicare," he whispers helpfully. "They have these commercials down here: 'You won't even have to pay for your scooter! Medicare will pay!' Practically everyone in Kentucky has one."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A hall full of elderly white people in Medicare-paid scooters, railing against government spending and imagining themselves revolutionaries as they cheer on the vice-presidential puppet hand-picked by the GOP establishment. If there exists a better snapshot of everything the Tea Party represents, I can't imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the whole thing. Who are the teabaggers? Cranky, ignorant old racist hypocrites who are all about me-me-me-me, deftly manipulated by the big business establishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/taibbi_among_the_teabaggers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YdHkLTfN6W0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285774073513"><id gr:original-id="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2342">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0b336a126e0a148</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Surprise – Science Education Stinks!</title><published>2010-09-29T14:15:44Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T14:15:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2342" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, NeuroLogica is working again, our bandwidth has been widened, WordPress has been tweaked, and I’m looking forward to getting back to my regular schedule of blogging (Thanks to Mike Lacelle for his hard work getting everything online again.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would start with this item regarding science education in the US – &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2010-09-23-science-education_N.htm?csp=34news"&gt;Report: Poor science education impairs U.S. economy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s yet another depressing report about the sad state of science education. The US is also not alone – the UK is considering gutting support for science, and other countries are lagging as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generally accepted version of history is that in the 1950s, following Sputnik, nationalism and fear of competition from the USSR spawned an era of heavy investment in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This ultimately resulted in the science and technology boom in the US in the following decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of decades support for STEM has lagged, and so has the quality of science education. This latest report concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;•U.S. mathematics and science K-12 education ranks 48th worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•49% of U.S. adults don’t know how long it takes for the Earth to circle the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•China has replaced the United States as the world’s top high-technology exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationalistic impulses aside – this is not good for the future. Almost half of Americans do not know the Earth takes a year to circle the sun. In my opinion this is not a random bit of science trivia. This indicates a rather profound lack of understanding of the basic structure of the universe, which in turn (in my opinion) indicates a severe lack of curiosity or a contentment with being mystified by the basic realities of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also not convinced the problem is merely a lack of funding. My daughters go to a well-funded public school in a relatively affluent part of the country. So far, I have not been impressed with their science education. I think the entire approach (at least in grade school) is lacking. Mostly science has been taught by teachers with a general background, and with a highly variable (and inadequate, in my opinion) personal knowledge and enthusiasm toward science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter in second grade will get 1 hour of science every other week or so, and it is not even clear to me what the goals of this year are. My older daughter has been subjected to worthless exercises meant to teach experimental method, and other projects of dubious value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the emphasis has shifted to “exploring” science – but as a result important meat is being left out. Further, I have noticed that information is taught largely in isolation, and students are not given an understanding of how to apply their knowledge. I do not get the sense they are building a body of knowledge and cognitive skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have largely taken responsibility for my own daughters’ science education, so I am not concerned for them.  When I teach them about science, it also gives me a window into what they are learning (and not learning) at school. I don’t get the sense that they are being made to think about science is a practical and insightful way – learning basic principles and the facts that establish those principles. When I ask them questions like,  “how do we know” – I get the sense no one else has ever asked them that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US is serious about improving science education we need to do more than just increase funding. It seems to me we need to review the entire system of science education. Further we need to get away from the education culture that seems to have eroded the quality of science education over the last few decades. We should enlist the aid of actual working scientists who have demonstrated a talent and passion for education, to design science curricula that will meet our goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285773812254"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=5252">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/519715ae14cf9a7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="msuic"/><category term="sufjan stevens"/><title type="html">The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades</title><published>2010-09-29T15:22:32Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T15:22:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/the-parasitic-wasp-of-the-palisades/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A bit of art/music for a quiet afternoon.

In other words, when a  section of chromosome flips over it traps adapted genes.  By holding  these adapted genes prisoner, the reversed chromosomal section then has  the fuel it needs to spread across the land.  The consequence of its  spread is reproductive isolation and potentially a new species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2010/09/Picture-1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture 1" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2010/09/Picture-1.png" alt="Picture 1" width="223" height="247"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;David’s an evolutionary plant geneticist interested in speciation–the  environmental and geographic reasons that organisms become two separate  species as well as the genetic basis of this process. Why does this matter?  When scientists are able to understand adaptive genetic variation  within a species, they will be able to do a better job predicting its  response to shifting environmental conditions. (Pretty important, given  the challenges of limited resources and a changing climate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David’s research over much of the past decade has looked at the  heterogeneity of California’s Mediterranean ecosystems. He focused on  two ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, &lt;em&gt;Mimulus guttatus&lt;/em&gt;. One is a  coastal perennial  (&lt;em&gt;pictured left&lt;/em&gt;) version while the other is an annual (&lt;em&gt;pictured right&lt;/em&gt;) that’s found in  inland habitats. David looked at how adaptation to environmental  stresses such as drought and salt tolerance leads to reproductive  isolating barriers between these annual and perennial types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the cool part: David has discovered regions of the genome  that contribute traits like flowering time, salt tolerance, anthocyanin  production, and nutrient uptake between the coastal and inland ecotypes.  He spent years crossing numerous individual plants to conduct an  experiment that reversed the genetic information for these traits in  both lines and then planted them back into coastal and inland habitats in California to test the effects of these gene differences in  nature.  In this way, he was able to show that the chromosome  inversion polymorphism (&lt;em&gt;i.e. reversed chunk of chromosome&lt;/em&gt;), which is  spread widely over North America, actually causes adaptation and  reproductive isolation in nature.  While he does not know yet what  piece of the inversion is responsible for this pattern, he speculates a number of the over 350 genes stuck in the inversion are  involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having watched David toil away in the field and laboratory for years, I am so excited to see &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000500"&gt;this awesome comprehensive article &lt;/a&gt;published!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find people these days who have anything nice to say about her.  For all she did — like getting &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abington_School_District_v._Schempp"&gt;mandatory prayer out of public school&lt;/a&gt; — she was rude, unpleasant to be around, and not popular even within a like-minded crowd.  The biographies written about her attest to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I asked over a dozen atheists/Humanist leaders of the present day if they had anything to say about Madalyn and her legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got one response.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even that person admitted it would be tough to find anyone saying something positive about her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responder did give Madalyn credit for one thing, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many people today blame Madalyn’s anger and flamboyance for the negative stereotype of atheists today.  If it weren’t for that anger and flamboyance, however, there wouldn’t be an atheist movement today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some truth to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the “angry atheists” who are the spokespeople for our movement (whether we like it or not) are much more affable than Madalyn ever was.  That combination of fame, a minority viewpoint, and a mass of people eager to follow you is what it takes to build a real movement.  Madalyn had the first two, but many atheists didn’t want to follow her. They wanted to get away from her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Madalyn, we learned what a true activist was willing to sacrifice.  Unfortunately, we also learned how not to spread our message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how she would fare in the present environment. Would she be popular? Would she have a strong following in the wake of “New Atheism”?  Or would we just get upset or annoyed every time she wrote an article or did an interview?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A cartoon which did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; depict Mohammed, but whose punchline was "Picture book title voted least likely to ever find a publisher… ‘Where’s Muhammad?'" was rejected by upwards of 20 newspapers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I am not an influential cartoonist.  Or an influential anything, for that matter.  But if I were, the protest I would suggest is for established cartoonists to pick a "Draw Nothing Day".  For your cartoon that day, turn in an empty panel or panels.  That's it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many people who support free speech but who feel uncomfortable drawing Mohammed, not just for fear of getting blowd up, but out of a genuine respect for others' religious sensibilities.  (That would not be me, of course)  So we would not ask these people to draw Mohammed, and in any case, even if it were realistic, getting major US newspapers to publish cartoons of Mohammed would probably result in copious death and violence.  (Fucked up, eh?)  But surely an empty captionless frame could be drawn?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anybody like this idea?

Shirvell has been on a long-running crusade against a fellow named Chris Armstrong, creating a blog called "&lt;a href="http://chris-armstrong-watch.blogspot.com/"&gt;Chris Armstrong Watch&lt;/a&gt;" (always a bad sign), picketing his house, monitoring his facebook page, making wild accusations that Armstrong is abusing his power, etc., etc., etc. Shirvell is the perfect picture of insanity. He's so out of control that he was &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/09/28/michigan.justice.blog/index.html?hpt=C1"&gt;invited to appear on CNN&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because crazy haters make good copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shirvell acknowledged protesting outside of Armstrong's house and calling him "Satan's representative on the student assembly."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I'm a Christian citizen exercising my First Amendment rights," Shirvell told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "I have no problem with the fact that Chris is a homosexual. I have a problem with the fact that he's advancing a radical homosexual agenda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Shirvell  is a Christian fanatic. He&amp;#39;s also dishonest: browse his blog and you can tell he is just freaking out over the fact that Armstrong is gay…it&amp;#39;s all he talks about. He&amp;#39;s a militant radical gay activist who hates God, Christians, the unborn, and wants to have gay sex with everyone but Andrew Shirvell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scary part is that Armstrong is just the student body president at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, a position with almost no power. Shirvell is an &lt;i&gt;assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan&lt;/i&gt;.

This has mostly been spawned by the perceived “Republican War on Science,” at the center of which is the global warming debate. In reality, both ends of the political spectrum (as evidenced, for example, by the Huffington Post) tend to trump science with ideology. That is the nature of politics. But at least the issue has been raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, defenders of science have pointed out that science should inform politics, not the other way around. Ideologues should not be allowed to put their thumb on the scale of science in order to get the result their ideology demands. Further, the optimal policy emerges from an honest assessment of the relevant science. Values still come into play for many issues, so science alone is not enough, but the science has to be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within medicine this issue often involves the regulation of the standard of care and public health policy. An example of the former is the law passed last year is Connecticut that essentially exempts professionals who treat “chronic Lyme disease” from the standard of care – the department of health cannot act against their license for treating this controversial condition with unproven therapies.Rather than allowing experts to determine the standard of care, which is an ever moving target, this law locks into place a very controversial, and in my opinion dubious, practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue that frequently is caught between politics and science is vaccinations – and just such a conflict is heating up in Florida. &lt;a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2010-09-30/news/crist-backer-gary-kompothecras-bullies-florida-health-officials/"&gt;Penn Bullock and Brandon K. Thorp report&lt;/a&gt; in the Miami News Times that a wealthy chiropractor, Gary Kompothecras, is using his political connections, earned by generous campaign contributions, to promote his apparent anti-vaccine agenda. Kompothecras has two children with autism and he blames thimerosal in vaccines for their condition. Readers of SBM know that thimerosal (which contains ethyl mercury) has not been connected to autism. The scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that vaccines are not to blame. Most notably with regard to thimerosal specifically, this preservative was removed from most childhood vaccines over 8 years ago in the US, and autism rates have not plummeted as proponents of the thimerosal hypothesis predicted. Yet some, like Kompothecras, still cling to this discredited notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago Kompothecras (who calls himself the “rainmaker” – a reference to his political connections) was pushing for a &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/article994157.ece"&gt;law that would have weakened Florida’s vaccine requirement&lt;/a&gt; for public school. Such measures are always sold as parent choice or health freedom, but they are really just anti-vaccine. The bill, which is still languishing, would outlaw certain vaccines with thimerosal and would allow parents to space out and delay vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of the disconnect between science and politics – there is no evidence that delaying or spacing out vaccines has any health benefit, but it does leave children vulnerable to preventable diseases for longer. So delaying vaccines has risk but no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is therefore an example of one man who is using political connections to push for legislation that is not based upon science and runs contrary to the consensus of expert opinion.&lt;br&gt;
Kompothecras is now at it again, using political pressure to “bully” the Florida department of health into releasing confidential vaccine records. Kompothecras is a friend and contributor to governor Charlie Crist, and was appointed to the governor’s task force on autism (a scary thought in itself). He wants the DOH to give this confidential information to the infamous father and son team of Mark and David Geier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have written extensively about them as well – most significantly their recent trial of&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2815"&gt; lupron (a chemical castrating agent) and chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; (a risky procedure) for autism. The Geiers have been publishing research alleging to show a connection between vaccines and autism, but their results are at odds with other researchers and seem highly flawed and dubious on review. Bullock and Thorpe summarize their career thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Mark Geier embraced the autism theory, his appearances in federal courts have led judges to label his testimonies “intellectually dishonest” and “not reliable.” The Institute of Medicine has called his work “uninterpretable.” The American Academy of Pediatrics said one of his studies exhibited “numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am always in favor of transparency of information. As we learned with climate gate, keeping data from those who you perceive to have an anti-scientific agenda can backfire. But confidential medical records are not temperature data. There is an issue of confidentiality that needs to be dealt with. Medical information can be released for legitimate research that is in the public interest – but there’s the rub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geiers have a dubious scientific history of misinterpreting data, apparently to serve an anti-vaccine agenda and to support their lucrative practice of treating alleged mercury poisoning. No one has a right to perform medical research, or a right to privileged medical information. You have to earn the privilege of access by being an ethical and legitimate researcher. In my opinion, the Geiers do not meet these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Florida DOH agrees, but the normal process of assessing the legitimacy of requests for information is being subverted by political pressure from a wealthy and connected chiropractor with an apparent anti-vaccine agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a no-win scenario for the DOH – whether or not they release the data it can be used for anti-vaccine propaganda purposes. Perhaps one compromise would be to release the data to an independent panel of researchers with no conflicts of interest to do an independent and transparent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this example of using political pressure to subvert science is not isolated. In many states there are laws to subvert the vaccine program, or to protect dubious practitioners from being held to the standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger issue is that “alternative medicine” is an industry that has learned to use the political process to advance their interests over that of the consumer and the public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hn.se/nyheter/falkenberg/1.968850-nu-visas-gravkitteln-fran-skrea-backe"&gt;Here's something new&lt;/a&gt; in burial archaeology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008 a cremation burial of the Pre-Roman Iron Age was excavated at Skrea backe near Falkenberg in Halland province. It's unusually rich for its time, being housed in a continental iron-and-bronze cauldron and containing three knives, an awl and 5.3 litres of burnt bones from a lamb, a sheep, two pig's trotters, a bird and three people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never seen a knife-handle like that before, with an iron-rod frame, but I've never really worked with the period nor with Halland so that counts for little. A bizarre detail though is that a foot bone from the sheep has two pieces of thin iron tube inside. I think they may be the remains of two solid iron rods whose surface layer was altered by the pyre's heat, their innards rusting away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; nice but not unheard-of before. What's new with this burial is that the excavator has had bones from all three buried people radiocarbon-dated, and they turned out to have died at different dates over a span of about a century! A man of ~35 and an adolescent of 10-14 have been disinterred and cremated along with a woman of ~55 around 150 BC, long after the first two people died. Or their bones were curated above ground. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A 100-year gap is too long among Iron Age porridge eaters to represent a marine reservoir effect.)&lt;/p&gt;

In the past few years several prominent researchers have argued for the adoption of taxes on junk food as a means of reducing their consumption.  Often, as in a recent editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, the argument is made that money collected through the tax could then be used to subsidize healthier foods.  This is an idea that I’ve found very appealing – we make the bad foods more expensive, the good foods less expensive, and people will probably shift at least some of their purchases to those healthier options.  But a very interesting new study by Leonard Epstein and colleagues suggests that things might not be so simple.

The paper starts with some very interesting background information on the cost of food over the past few decades.  For example, relative to other goods and services, current food prices are 38% lower than in 1978 (although the absolute cost of food has increased due to inflation).  And while overall the absolute cost of food has increased, this increase has been far greater in healthy foods than in unhealthy foods.  The graph below shows the increased cost for various foods since 1983.  As you can see, the cost of fresh fruit and veggies has increased by nearly 200% – 3 times greater than the increase seen in sugars and sweets, and roughly 6 times the increase seen in carbonated beverages (For a terrific exploration of why junk food can be so much cheaper than healthier alternatives, be sure to check out The Omnivore’s Dilemma by Michael Pollan).

Based on data published by Finkelstein et al., as cited by Epstein et al.

Epstein and colleagues point out that food prices have a strong influence on purchases, which makes it seem very reasonable that the relative changes in the cost of healthy and unhealthy foods over the past 25 years could be influencing food purchases, and therefore obesity rates. For this reason, changing the cost of food through the use of taxes and/or subsidies are obvious targets to curb caloric consumption at the societal level.  But they also point out that intentionally manipulating the price of food could have unintended consequences, especially with respect to subsidies for health foods.  For example, if health foods are subsidized, it is likely that people will buy more of them, which seems like a good thing.  But it is also very possible that people may use the money they save on subsidized health foods to buy even more junk food – an unintended consequence that I had never really considered.  Thus, the authors performed a small experiment to determine the effect of both fat taxes and health food subsidies on food purchasing behaviours.

Participants in the study included 42 mothers who were also the primary food shopper for their family.  The mothers were then placed in a laboratory fitted out to resemble a grocery store, and given $22.50 per family member and told to:

“imagine that she had no food in her house and that the money she was given was to be used to purchase groceries for her family for the week”.

Participants were told to spend all of their money, and each participant went “shopping” 5 times – once with all foods priced accurately, twice with the cost of healthy foods lowered (by either 12.5% or 25%), and twice with the cost of unhealthy foods increased (again by 12.5% and 25%, respectively).  So, what happened?

As you might expect, as the cost of unhealthy foods was increased, the amount of total calories purchased was significantly reduced.  However, as the cost of healthy foods was lowered, the total number of calories purchased actually increased.  In other words, people were using the money they saved on healthy foods to purchase more unhealthy foods.  A health-food subsidy of 12.5% resulted in about an 800 calorie increase in total calories purchased, while a health-food subsidy of 25% resulted in an increase of about 1,500 calories.  So it seems that the health-food subsidy may not just increase the purchase of health foods – it may increase the purchase of all foods, regardless of their nutritional value.

Now there are obviously a lot of caveats to a study like this, and the authors are quite cautious in how they interpret their results.  For starters, participants were told that they had to spend all of their money during each trial, which makes it almost impossible for the health-food subsidy to result in anything but an increase in total food purchases.  So for that reason alone I’m pretty hesitant to take this study as evidence that subsidizing health foods is a bad idea.  But it is interesting, and I’m really curious to see if this finding is supported by studies looking at more “real world” settings.

The paper is published in the journal Psychological Science and it’s free to the public, so I’d really recommend you check it out.  Some of their graphs (which I couldn’t re-publish here due to copyright issues) are especially worth the download.

So what do you think – are taxes and/or subsidies a good or bad idea?

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I want to make it abundantly clear that chiles should never be stuffed with anything other than cheese.  If you show up in the comments section to tell me about stuffing chiles with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picadillo"&gt;picadillo&lt;/a&gt; or tuna during Lent, I am going to replace your comment with this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zLEi4n1pjqI%26hl%3Den_US%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26version%3D3&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=390" width="640" height="390"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;,&lt;br&gt;...because that is exactly how annoying I will find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the point of really good chiles rellenos is to celebrate delicious chiles and cheese.  Everything that you do should be to enhance the flavors of the chiles and cheese.  So, it is important to start with really good &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCEKXFy3rK4"&gt;poblano peppers&lt;/a&gt;.  The first step is to roast and peel the peppers.  I had Mr. Isis throw our peppers on the grill last night while he was making our dinner for the evening.  Then, once the peppers are charred, place them in a plastic bag and seal them up.  Most people leave their peppers for 30 minutes or so.  I usually leave my peppers overnight.  The next step is to remove the skin (see&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md43g1dw6Jc"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;)  and I think a longer time in the bag makes that all easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles10.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles10.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles10-thumb-350x466-56373.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="274" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles9.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles9.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles9-thumb-350x466-56371.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="281" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Removing the skin and the final peeled pepper&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I removed my skins this morning and then placed the peppers in the fridge.  Having a chilled pepper means that the outside will cook more quickly than the inside and you won't end up with an overcooked pepper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are ready to stuff the peppers, assemble the ingredients...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles8.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles8-thumb-350x262-56375.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="292" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Ingredients.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One egg for each pepper&lt;br&gt;Flour for dredging&lt;br&gt;2 cans fire-roasted, diced tomatoes (you can certainly make your own, but these were good enough&lt;br&gt;About 1/4 lb queso fresco (a cheese that melts with a creamy texture)&lt;br&gt;About 1/4 lb queso chihuahua (this cheese has a more stringy texture)&lt;br&gt;A can of diced chiles (I don't use jalapenos because Little Isis won't eat them)&lt;br&gt;A few cloves of garlic&lt;br&gt;Toothpicks&lt;br&gt;An onion&lt;br&gt;A bunch of cilantro&lt;br&gt;A bunch of oregano&lt;br&gt;Salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a food processor, process the onion to a fairly fine mince:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles7.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles7-thumb-350x466-56377.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="208" height="277"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: The onions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then dump all the onion bits into a sauce pan.  This will be the base of the sauce, but leave anything that doesn&amp;#39;t leave the bowl easily for the base of the cheese.  To the sauce pan, add a few cloves of minced garlic, the tomatoes, the chiles, a handful of garlic and oregano, salt, and a tablespoon of olive oil.  Simmer on low heat.  This will become the sauce for the chiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles6.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles6-thumb-280x210-56381.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="280" height="210"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 4: The Sauce.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the food processor, add the two cheese and process with the remaining onions.  This will form a soft cheese for stuffing the peppers.  I know plenty of people who stuff their peppers with chunks of cheese, but I prefer this because the soft cheese can be used to entirely fill the pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, make a slit halfway down the pepper, beginning at the stem.  You can remove the seeds for less heat, although I usually choose not to.  Fill the pepper with cheese and close it with toothpicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles4.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles4-thumb-300x400-56379.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="229" height="306"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 5:  The stages of pepper stuffing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crack and separate the eggs.   Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with about a smidge of flour and a healthy pinch of salt until it looks like a thin paste.  Add this to the egg white peaks.  The egg whites should still form peaks, but they should be pale yellow peaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles5.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles5-thumb-270x360-56383.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="270" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 6: The egg situation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dredge the peppers through flour until the are completely coated.  Then, dip the peppers into the egg mixture until they are completely and very generously coated.  Now,  I won&amp;#39;t lie.  The best chiles rellenos I ever had were cooked in lard,  Still, corn oil is a decent alternative.   Place them in a pan of corn oil, heated over medium heat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles2-thumb-270x202-56389.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="270" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles1-thumb-270x202-56391.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="270" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 7: Happy little rellenitos, cooking in the pan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last step is to place them on the t.  Most chiles rellenos I have had have been covered in sauce.  But, here&amp;#39;s my general opinion - if you&amp;#39;re going to spend all this time stuffing a chile, coating it in a complicated egg and flour mixture, and then frying it to slightly crispy perfection, why would you smother it in sauce?   After all, anyone could get a mushy chile covered in salsa at their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-Chi%27s"&gt;local Chi-Chis&lt;/a&gt;.  So, instead of covering the chile with sauce, I place the chile on top of the sauce.  That way I get the flavor of the sauce without losing the texture of the chile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy, Prof-Like!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/chiles.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chiles.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/09/chiles-thumb-300x225-56393.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 8: Al Fin!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/09/un_regalito_para_prof-like.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/mIvyJyjEbeE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285756001651"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=29211">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f16569440d7e472</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Demographics"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Why Are Atheists/Agnostics the Most Religiously Literate Groups?</title><published>2010-09-29T10:00:23Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T10:00:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/29/why-are-atheistsagnostics-the-most-religiously-literate-groups/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a new survey that showcases atheists in a good or bad light is released, we’re all writing about it somewhere or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Pew Forum’s recent study on US Religious Knowledge showed that &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/27/how-ignorant-about-religion-are-religious-americans/"&gt;atheists scored higher on basic religious literacy&lt;/a&gt; than any faith group, there are a lot of responses out there from our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/religion_theseeker/2010/09/atheists-know-more-about-religion-thats-why-were-atheists.html"&gt;I wrote a piece for the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; explaining why atheists scored higher than others.  My reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many atheists left religion in the first place because we learned too much about our faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheists pay attention when we hear religious groups make ridiculous statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheists tends to be better educated than the rest of the population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detailed explanations are in the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave Silverman&lt;/strong&gt; of American Atheists already got off a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/us/28religion.html"&gt;terrific zinger&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Atheism is an effect of that knowledge, not a lack of knowledge. I gave a Bible to my daughter. That’s how you make atheists.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he wasn’t done there. Dave &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/09/28/dave-silverman-pew-survey-atheists-bible-preacher-god-islam-holy-american/"&gt;wrote a full piece&lt;/a&gt; for FOXNews.com adding his own explanations for why the study came out that way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many religious people do not read their holy books for fear of finding things they don’t like, which will force them to consider whether those easy answers are valid, and whether death is in fact permanent. In other words, religious people already have doubts, and avoid reading their Bibles to avoid addressing those doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preachers, on the other hand, know that knowledge of the Bible can often lead to atheism, so they prefer the flock listen to the preacher talk about the Bible (which the preacher can edit as he sees fit), rather than read it themselves. This is how they make a (tax free) living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person begins to doubt the veracity of the religion into which they happen to have been born, they often read the holy books in the hope that they are wrong, that it will all make sense, and that the answers provided by those books will be logically valid. The problem is, they aren’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further study will show that indeed, all religions are the same in that none of them provide anything but yesterday’s mythology.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be shocked if any preacher actually wanted his flock to read less of the Bible — many large churches promote small group Bible studies — but I think Dave’s right that many Christians choose not to read the Bible for themselves. They like having someone else interpret it for them, leaving out the stuff that might cause cognitive dissonance.  Which is disappointing.  If people understood why they reject every other god, maybe they’d see why we reject theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Flynn&lt;/strong&gt; of the Council for Secular Humanism &lt;a href="http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/tom_flynn/2010/09/know_thy_enemy.html"&gt;has his own theory&lt;/a&gt; about the results at the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; On Faith blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… &lt;strong&gt;as adherents of an often-unpopular worldview, atheists and agnostics are frequently challenged to defend their position.&lt;/strong&gt; In my experience, people whom propriety would restrain from grilling a Mormon or Jehovah’s Witness about his or her religious beliefs are seldom shy about challenging the unbelievers they encounter. &lt;strong&gt;So even atheists and agnostics who didn’t engage in the study of religion in the course of abandoning their childhood faith feel pressure to come to “know thy enemy.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless blogs have commented on this story, too.  If you wrote something, feel free to link to it in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we missing any other possible explanations for why atheists fared so well (compared to theists) in this study?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They were surprised to find that this virus is at least 19m years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been very excited to tell you about a new paper that has just been published by &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/"&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/a&gt;. This paper nicely unites the two fields of evolutionary biology that I am most passionate about, the evolution of viruses and evolution of birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;According to this newly published paper, fragments of ancient viruses have been discovered hiding in the chromosomes of songbirds, including popular pets like zebra finches, &lt;em&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/em&gt; (top). DNA analysis indicates these viral remnants are ancient hepadnaviruses, a family of DNA viruses that includes the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects roughly one-third of the world's human population, causing a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ancient viruses are endogenous viruses: they insert themselves or pieces of themselves into the genome of an organism, and are then passed from one generation to the next. Up until now, nearly all endogenous viruses found have been retroviruses. This is not surprising since insertion of the retrovirus into the host's genome is an essential part of its life cycle. But when deactivated fragments of these viral freeloaders reside in a host's genome for millions of years, they are referred to as "fossil viruses" and the scientists who study them are palaeovirologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As genome sequencing becomes easier and cheaper, palaeovirologists are now uncovering remnants of other types of virus such as hepadnaviruses in a variety of organisms ranging from fungi to plants - and even including humans [DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08695"&gt;10.1038/nature08695&lt;/a&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting, this discovery shows that hepadnaviruses,&lt;br&gt;originally thought to be 6000 years old, are much older than scientists realised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've been sitting there for at least 19 million years, far longer than anyone previously thought this family of viruses had been in existence," said Cédric Feschotte and Clément Gilbert, the paper's two co-authors. Dr Feschotte, an associate professor and Dr Gilbert, a post-doctoral research associate, are members of the Genome Biology Group at the University of Texas at Arlington, where they study the evolution of the genome and how ancient viruses have shaped their hosts' immune systems over millions of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr Gilbert and Dr Feschotte didn't know to look at avian DNA to find this particular fossil virus. Instead, they started by searching for HBV in GenBank, a public database that contains more than 100 million DNA sequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We screened all complete genomes that are available in public web databases using the human hepatitis B sequence as a query," Dr Gilbert explained to me in an email. "The zebra finch was the only species where we found integrated HBV-like fragments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found 15 of these HBV-like fragments sprinkled throughout 10 of the zebra finch's 33 chromosomes, most with one or more mutations that rendered them inactive. Thus, these fossil viruses are functionally dead, but their imprint remains, ghost-like, in their host's genome, marking the passage of time by accumulating random errors when copied, as does the surrounding genomic DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of differences between these 15 HBV-like fragments and hepadnaviruses show that the zebra finch HBV-like fragments fell into one of two groups (collectively known as endogenous zebra finch HBVs [eZHBVs]), suggesting that the virus inserted itself twice into the bird's DNA before being shuffled around the genome (red branches in Figure 2, below). While similar, the endogenous fossil viruses that are embedded in the songbird genomes were distinct from free-roaming extant avian hepadnaviruses (blue branches) while mammalian hepadnaviruses segregated into their own distinct groups (black branches): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how long had these two eZHBVs been present in the finch genome? To answer this question, Dr Gilbert and Dr Feschotte first had to compare the eZHBVs from closely related songbird species (black throated finch, Poephila cincta; scaly breasted munia, Lonchura punctulata; and gouldian finch, Chloebia gouldiae) and from two more distantly related birds (dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis and the olive sunbird, Cyanomitra olivaceus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing differences between the eZHBVs (red branches) to those in&lt;br&gt;free-roaming extant avian hepadnaviruses (black branches), the team used their data to construct a family tree for the fossil virus. They then compared the fossil virus tree to their avian hosts' family tree, using them as an evolutionary clock, and found the two trees looked the same (see right side in Figure 3, below):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the family trees for the fossil virus and the bird species,&lt;br&gt;the team found that the most distantly related of the birds, the olive sunbird, lacked the virus, whereas it was present in all the other birds' genomes. Based on other scientists' work documenting the timing for when these species arose, they concluded that the first viral insertion occurred between 35 million and 25 million years ago, when the dark-eyed junco, the next oldest relative, split off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Gilbert and Dr Feschotte then used the molecular clock method, which verified their findings and indicated that the first fossil virus had inserted itself into the birds' genome between 19 and 40 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these data strongly suggest that the fossil eZHBVs integrated into the genome of the songbird's common ancestor that lived more than 19 million years ago, prior to the evolution of these different bird species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Gilbert, the team was also surprised to find "a strikingly slow, long-term mutation rate that is 1,000 times slower than the viral [mutation] rates that had previously been estimated based on comparisons of currently circulating viral sequences only."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team compared the fossil virus to extant hepadnaviruses, they were surprised to learn that, despite their antiquity, the fossil hepadnaviruses are remarkably similar to the modern viruses. Dr Feschotte thinks that the slow evolution of the hepadnaviruses observed in birds indicates that these viruses are better adapted to their avian hosts than what is suggested by research into the disease-causing HBVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genomic fossils like the remarkable hepadnaviral fossils found by Gilbert and Feschotte have the prospect of completely revising our preconceived notions about the age and evolution of such viruses," said Harmit Singh Malik, who was not part of the study. Dr Malik is an associate member of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and is one of the leaders in the emerging field of palaeovirology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They provide an unexpectedly clear lens on an ancient time when these viruses were prevalent and abundant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddie Holmes, a distinguished professor of biology at Pennsylvania State University's Eberly College of Science and an expert in the field of viral evolution, said the team's work "provides a glimpse into an ancient viral world that we never knew existed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results they obtained were remarkable; whereas we previously thought of hepadnavirus evolution on timescales of only a few thousand years, this paper shows that the true timescale is in fact many million years," said Dr Holmes, who is currently traveling, in a press release. "Therefore, hepadnavirues, and likely many other viruses as well, are far older than we previously thought." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fossil viruses are not capable of causing disease in birds, nor infecting humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The viruses that we found are very old, are integrated in the bird genome, and do not have the potential to encode any functional protein product," said Dr Gilbert. "So they do not have any effect in songbirds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finding these viruses fossilised in songbird genomes tells us that they were once infecting these birds, like hepatitis B is infecting humans today," said Dr Gilbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is not possible to know whether these ancient viruses caused the same disease in birds as HBV does in humans today, "it is possible that some of these birds may still be infected by HBV-like viruses today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study will catalyse new lines of inquiry that may help scientists predict and prevent future human viral pandemics that originate in birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope our study will encourage people to screen for the presence of such circulating viruses in this group of birds," said Dr Gilbert. "We can therefore use this discovery as a guide to screen targeted groups of bird species for the presence of new circulating hepatitis B-like viruses." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=PLoS+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3A%2F&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Genomic+Fossils+Calibrate+the+Long-Term+Evolution+of+Hepadnaviruses.&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2010&amp;amp;rft.volume=8&amp;amp;rft.issue=9&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fbiology.plosjourn...&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style="&gt;

So why do drunk people seem so prone to aggravation and argument? One reason, say Laurent Bègue and colleagues, is that alcohol exacerbates the &amp;#39;intentionality bias&amp;#39;, our natural tendency to assume that other people intended their actions. So when that guy jolts you at the bar and you&amp;#39;re drunk, you&amp;#39;re more likely to think he did it on purpose.

Bègue&amp;#39;s team recruited 92 men (aged 20 to 46) to take part in what they were told was a taste-testing study. They were given three glasses to taste, each containing a cocktail of grapefruit and grenadine cordial, mint and lemon concentrate. For half the participants, the drinks also contained alcohol - approximately the same amount found in five to six shots of vodka. To control for expectancy effects, half the participants with the alcoholic drinks and half the non-alcohol participants were told the drinks were alcoholic. Next, the participants spent 20 to 30 minutes on filler tasks, in keeping with the cover story that this was a taste-test study, and to allow the alcohol to kick-in. Finally and most importantly, the participants read 50 sentences about various actions (e.g. &amp;#39;He deleted the email&amp;#39;) and gave their verdict on whether the actions were intentional or not.

The intoxicated and sober men alike said that obviously intentionally actions (e.g. &amp;#39;she looked for her keys&amp;#39;) were intentional, and that blatantly unintentional actions (e.g. &amp;#39;she caught a cold&amp;#39;) were unintentional. But crucially, when it came to more ambiguous actions, like the email deletion example, the intoxicated men were significantly more likely (43 per cent) than the sober men (36 per cent) to say the action was intentional. Whether participants were told they&amp;#39;d had alcohol or not made no difference. 

Why should alcohol have this effect? Bègue&amp;#39;s team think that it takes cognitive effort and control to overcome the intentionality bias, especially so as to take in all the information necessary to consider alternative explanations. Alcohol&amp;#39;s well-known disinhibitory and myopic (the &amp;#39;narrowing of attention&amp;#39;) effects would clearly undermine these faculties.

&amp;#39;In summary,&amp;#39; the researchers concluded, &amp;#39;alcohol magnifies the intentionality bias. Napoleon said, &amp;quot;There is no such thing as accident.&amp;quot; Our findings suggest that drunk people are more likely to believe Napoleon&amp;#39;s statement than are sober people.&amp;#39;

No, these aren’t cells from actual fireflies but cells so named for their ability to glow like fireflies and contains the same enzyme that makes fireflies glow. But I think the coolest part of this story is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “firefly” stem cells glow brighter and brighter as they develop into  healthy heart muscle, allowing doctors to track whether and where the  stem cells are working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially we can now track the stem cells and see exactly what they’re doing. Kinda takes all the mystery out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the loss of sharks, even through by-catch, is likely to have devastating ecosystem impacts, not just in North Carolina, but likely in many coastal areas.

Science (New York, N.Y.), 315 (5820), 1846-50 PMID: 17395829Another paper that came out of the Charles Peterson group (he was a co-author on the above Science paper) investigated restoration options for scallops in North Carolina.  Obviously, cownose rays still prevent a major problem.  One mode of restoration they examined was a way to protect adult scallops in a spawner sanctuary from predation by the rays.  They were able to accomplish this via a fairly simple method of using PVC stakes into the sediment that reached out of the water at high tide, evenly spaced narrowly enough so that the rays could not fit inside.  This method was capable of successfully maintaining dense populations of adult scallops during the period when the rays were in the estuary.  Obviously, allowing populations of adults to survive to spawning is a major step in enhancing scallop populations.

We&amp;#39;re adults here. I am not a playground monitor. I&amp;#39;m more of a distracted barkeep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also think those critics are all wrong. They tend to focus on a few four-letter words and an angry tone that some of us exhibit, and overlook the content. And it's the content of the message that matters. I just ran across a discussion of &lt;a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/on-hippy-punching-by-digby-i-havent.html"&gt;real problematic language from the right wingers&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it puts everything in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's one example, from the odious Ann Coulter. Now whenever Coulter is brought up here, there will always be a few pathetic jokes made about how she's a man, she has an adam's apple, stupid stuff like that, but I can also always rely on the commentariat here to slap those down promptly. She's a &lt;i&gt;woman&lt;/i&gt;, OK? A tall, slender woman, and physically she's not unattractive (psychologically, though, she's a horror), and it's annoying to see her targeted for her sex. But guess what? Ann Coulter doesn't mind doing a little stereotyping of her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that she used no profanity, and that you can scrutinize each word independently and find nothing that a good Christian could object to. Put them all together, though, and what you've got is an obscenity far nastier than anything said here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to impose censorship on Pharyngula as long as I can trust the commenters here to call out that kind of bigotry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/watch_your_language_young_lady.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/nyqq7gWcJiE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285729219209"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2671">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8c628a1e91ca4cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Colloquialisms"/><title type="html">Pen Pusher</title><published>2010-09-29T02:51:16Z</published><updated>2010-09-29T02:51:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2671" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received this e-mail from a Chinese scholar in the PRC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;I'm very sorry that fax machine can’t receive your fax because of mishandled by pen pusher. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goodness! How does he know such a colloquial expression as "pen pusher"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked that question of some friends, Brendan O&amp;#39;Kane wrote back:  &amp;quot;Online dictionaries are responsible for the occasional hypercolloquialism — http://www.nciku.com/search/en/detail/pen+pusher/1300456 . What I want to know is whether an analogous Chinese-Spanish dictionary will give &amp;#39;cagatintas&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seriously, though, why would Chinese-English dictionary makers bother to dredge up such an obscure term as "pen pusher"?  It only occurs twice in the 400 million word Corpus of Historical American English (&lt;a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/coha/"&gt;COHA&lt;/a&gt;), once in the 1950s and once in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I'm around office workers much of the day, I can't say that I've ever heard the term "pen pusher" used in the way my Chinese colleague does in the sentence quoted above.  To figure out what he really meant, I had to consult the &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pen%20pusher"&gt;Urban Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Un-needed, beaureucratic [sic] employee not making any difference and hampering efficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our overheads are not to blame for the shortfall, it's those damn pen pushers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's the exact sense my Chinese colleague wanted to convey.  He wanted a pejorative, disdainful term for the person in his office who prevented my fax from reaching him in a timely fashion.  If he had said "clerk" or "office worker," the effect just would not have been the same.  Still, it's rather jarring to encounter such an informal usage in the writing of someone who is not yet in full command of standard English.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, in the middle of a lecture on Marx, &lt;a href="http://delong.typepad.com/video/2009/05/delong-understanding-marx-lecture-for-april-20-2009.html"&gt;Brad DeLong&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Aristotle long ago pointed out that the drudgeries of everyday life would prevent most people from becoming true lovers of wisdom.  Too much time cooking and cleaning made it hard to curl up with a good philosophy book.  In Aristotle’s time, the solution was clear: have your slaves do the dirty work while you contemplated deep thoughts.  But he was smart enough to realize that there was another possible route to carving out free time: automation.  In the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html"&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (c. 350 BCE) he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only one condition in which we can imagine managers not needing subordinates, and masters not needing slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This condition would be that each (inanimate) instrument could do its own work, at the word of command or by intelligent anticipation, like the statues of Daedalus or the tripods made by Hephaestus, of which Homer relates that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Of their own motion they entered the conclave of Gods on Olympus” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as if a shuttle should weave of itself, and a plectrum should do its own harp playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect Aristotle would have been quite tickled at self-reassembling robots.  &lt;/p&gt;

Many eggs are beginning to hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up: &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; staff writer Michael Specter will be coming to New Haven to give a public talk on Monday, and then talk to my writing class Tuesday morning. Specter is the author of many important articles about science and medicine, some of which became the basis for his recent book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202303?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1594202303"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; You can find more about him on &lt;a href="http://www.michaelspecter.com/"&gt;his web site&lt;/a&gt; and hear him talk briefly about denialism during &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_specter_the_danger_of_science_denial.html"&gt;his recent TED lecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael will be speaking on Monday, October 4 at 4 pm at Morse College at Yale (302 York St.). It’s a Master’s Tea, which means we’ll be gathering in a living-room-like setting, with real tea for those who want it. I organized a tea at Morse in the spring for Rebecca Skloot for her &lt;a href="http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/book-tour/"&gt;self-made book tour&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/feb/09/skloot-discusses-hela-cells-at-tea/"&gt;Here’s an article about it,&lt;/a&gt; complete with a photo of the comfortable furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks go to the &lt;a href="http://opa.yale.edu/poynter.aspx"&gt;Poynter Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; for making Specter’s trip possible!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;===========================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a widely reported poll today (&lt;a href="http://features.pewforum.org/quiz/us-religious-knowledge/"&gt;here is the link to the actual Pew survey&lt;/a&gt;), it seems there are some rather counter-intuitive results regarding religious affiliation &amp;amp; level of factual religious knowledge in the United States.  Namely, from the survey, the non-religious (&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/atheism.html"&gt;atheists&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; agnostics) are among the most religiously literate when it comes to knowing facts &amp;amp; details about various religions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100928/ap_on_re/us_rel_religious_literacy_poll"&gt;&lt;img title="religions-of-world" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/religions-of-world.gif?w=309&amp;amp;h=302" alt="" width="309" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100928/ap_on_re/us_rel_religious_literacy_poll"&gt;Survey: Americans don’t know much about religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new survey of Americans’ knowledge of religion found that atheists,  agnostics, Jews and Mormons outperformed Protestants and Roman  Catholics in answering questions about major religions, while many  respondents could not correctly give the most basic tenets of their own  faiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five percent of Roman Catholics who  participated in the study didn’t know that, according to church  teaching, the bread and wine used in Holy Communion is not just a  symbol, but becomes the body and blood of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of Protestants could not identify  Martin Luther as the person who inspired the Protestant Reformation. And  about four in 10 Jews did not know that Maimonides, one of the greatest  rabbis and intellectuals in history, was Jewish. …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I am not a religious believer myself – I identify as an “Epicurean freethinker”, basically a modern-day atheist – I am a pretty serious student of religion and religious history.  I also include among my circle of friends &amp;amp; acquaintances people from all religious and non-religious backgrounds: Christians (including Catholics &amp;amp; Mormons), Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and so on.  However, I have to say that while I don’t believe any of the supernatural aspects of religion, I do understand how a knowledge of religion &amp;amp; religious history is advantageous in knowing more about who we are as a society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I am a bit amazed and upset by the results of this survey.  I would think that people who are sincere religious believers would want to be educated about the facts &amp;amp; history behind their faith.  If people don’t learn for themselves the factual information about the origins, history, and basic tenets of their own religion, then that opens them up to all manner of hucksterism in the name of God, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I know someone who is what I would call an ardent&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/ultrafundamentalism.html"&gt; fundamentalist Christian&lt;/a&gt;; however, they are also terribly ignorant of the origins &amp;amp; history of their own religion.  When I try to have a discussion with them about where the Bible came from, who wrote it, when it was written, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity"&gt;formation of the early Christian Church&lt;/a&gt;, and so on, they just want to ignore me or change the subject.  It is almost as if they are uncomfortable with the very thought of learning about their religion, as if they have a fear that if they learn too much their faith might be shaken (perhaps it might be).  As a result, they are heavily influenced by those who would use Christianity for political and other nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is what is going on with some religious believers: they want to remain willfully ignorant, because – as the saying goes – ignorance is bliss.  Or maybe they just want to be told what to believe by their religious leaders, either because they are a bit intellectually lazy (thinking about this stuff is hard work), they don’t have the time to look into it (if you’re working three jobs, it’s tough to study during what little free time you have), or they believe that if they question things they could be cast out of their religious community.  I’m sure it could be a combination of all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I think it is a sad state of affairs.  Knowledge, even the knowledge about religion, should be something that we aspire to collect &amp;amp; nurture.  Cultivating an environment of intellectual curiosity &amp;amp; critical thinking should be encouraged among the religious, partly because people can then arm themselves against those who would use their beliefs to manipulate them (such as politicians making &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/resources/brochures/is-america-a-christian-nation/"&gt;bogus “Christian nation” claims&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/faithhealing.html"&gt;crusading faith-healers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up: we need skeptics &amp;amp; critical thinkers in all areas of human endeavor, including religious believers within their religious communities.  Since the majority of the U.S. population is religious, the more ignorant they become about their own beliefs, the more susceptible they become to erroneous claims &amp;amp; extremism – and that can affect all of us.  If you know someone who is religious, or are religious yourself, take some time to actually &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; more about their (or your) faith.&lt;/p&gt;

Your child has a cold? Use Oil of Oregano. You have a headache? Oil of Oregano. Severed limb? Oil of Oregano! &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;Not being terribly familiar with Oil of Oregano I took to my books and the venerable but often misleading Internet to bone up on the subject. My previous experience with this told me that as a topical anti-bacterial, oil of oregano does indeed have some legitimate qualities that would probably be useful in a pinch if you had no other way to treat an external infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="2"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Giardia" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/Giardia.jpg" height="114" width="156"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giardia is on the run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from Oil of Oregano?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;The web, as it turns out, is chock full of interesting articles about this miracle cure, but unfortunately most of the articles are chock full of nothing more than anecdotes about how wonderful this oil is. In a brief search I found that oil of oregano is supposedly good for treatment of colds, flu, sore throat, bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma, bladder infections, kidney infections, peptic ulcers, fatigue,  headaches, allergies, bad breath, indigestion, parasites such as Giardia Lambia, cold sores, puncture wounds, dandruff, warts, athlete’s foot, boils, nail fungus, bed sores, head lice, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema, arthritis, back pain, and a whole lot more. In short, oil of oregano can not only make everyone multi-millionaires who are constantly happy and never pay taxes, but it can also ensure world peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;Let’s face it, any time that a product has a list of ailments it can cure that is this long, one just has to raise an eyebrow and ask about how realistic something like this could possibly be. As it turns out, a great deal of the hullaballoo over oil of oregano stems from a few small studies done in test tubes. As the website sciencebasedpharmacy.com so eloquently puts it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;“Oil of oregano is a great example of how test tube studies can be misleadingly exaggerated to imply meaningful effects in humans. With oil of oregano, a few small studies have been conducted, mainly in the lab, and believers argue  we should expect the same thing when we take it orally.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;Ultimately there are a few studies that show that oil of oregano has some anti-bacterial properties in the test tube (or petrie dish as the case may be), but many of the naturopathic medical folks have connected dots between these few small studies and reality. In fact, when looking at the pro-oil of oregano websites one finds the same references to a University of Tennessee study cited over and over again as justification that this miracle cure can solve all medical problems equally well. Readers seem to be encouraged to ‘try it on what ails you’ and of course most of these sites also have links for you to purchase their oil of oregano products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;What strikes me as perhaps the most amusing aspect of this is that these office dwellers who are all educated but not in the sciences, believe that the delivery system that is most effective for Oil of Oregano is to rub it on one’s &lt;i&gt;feet&lt;/i&gt;! I kid you not; for some reason the best way to deliver this wonder drug is through the well-established time-honored drug delivery system that is the soles of our feet.  This is so ridiculous I don’t even know where to begin.  All I can think is that at some point some reflexology therapists got themselves into the Oil of Oregano craze and decided that putting this oil on the bottoms of one’s feet is an effective way to delivery the drug to all parts of the body to enact the miracle cure that is surely forthcoming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"&gt;As with anything like this, the real danger lies in people foregoing western medicine for serious complaints, like Cancer, Asthma, or diabetes in favor of an oil of oregano cure/treatment. This can quite obviously lead to some serious problems, and for this reason if no other it’s important that we write blog posts like this to keep folks educated as much as possible. Even if one person is inspired to think twice, it’s a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>zoiks@shaw.ca (Bart Farkas)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285715663278"><id gr:original-id="http://www.labspaces.net/view_blog.php?blogID=601">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b278c9335cc7b1b4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Psycasm - Dark Ideas of Different Colours</title><published>2010-09-28T17:45:20Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T17:45:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/CSYM--0qI8M/view_blog.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.labspaces.net/view_blog.php?blogID=601"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">[Wherein our hero stumbles upon the worlds very first Synesthete, and quiety wishes that he too had super powers...]

As one can learn from the paper&amp;#39;s name, it deals with researchers&amp;#39; Twitter citing behavior. The snowball sampling here is a bit problematic, as the authors themselves admit in the conclusion part. They started with 3 academics from different disciplines, asked them to tweet about the research, and asked new participants to tweet about the research as well. They ended up with 28 academics (faculty, post-docs and Ph.D students).  They took a mixed-method approach, both interviewing the participants and harvesting their tweets. They sampled each participant&amp;#39;s last hundred tweets and their final sample included 2,322 tweets containing hyperlinks.Citations here were defined as &amp;quot;direct or indirect links from a tweet to a peer-reviewed scholarly research online&amp;quot;.  The citations were divided to direct citations (tweets which led straight to the academic resource) and indirect citations (there&amp;#39;s another web page between the tweet and the academic resource). 6% of the tweets in the sample contained citations. A bit more than half (52%) of those citations were direct and the rest were indirect. Main conclusionsOne of the reasons for indirect t-citings is the nonavailability of the academic resource itself. Instead of linking to a pay-walled paper, the link can be to a blog post discussing the paper. T-citings are considered part of an ongoing conversation between colleagues and are part of the researcher&amp;#39;s workflow. Unlike most citings in traditional academic discourse, t-citings aren&amp;#39;t usually used to support an argument, but to filter information. A t-citing can often be considered a recommendation for the resource in question. T-citings are faster than a speeding bullet. 15% of the t-citings were tweeted at the publishing day of the papers they referred to, and 39% of the t-citings were made within a week of  the paper&amp;#39;s publication. This is the first study I&amp;#39;ve read about Twitter citings and I believe the authors did a good job  in capturing the &amp;quot;water-cooler&amp;quot; essence of t-citings. A bigger sample might allow to study  the differences between the t-citing habits of researchers from different disciplines. *Okay, I emailed the authors.Priem, J., &amp;amp; Costello K. L. (2010).

One already took place and another is happening next month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Henrico County Public Schools will host two upcoming breakfast meetings for local faith-based leaders. Superintendent Dr. Patrick Russo will welcome the religious leaders and directly encourage their organizations to partner with Henrico County Public Schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henrico County Public Schools plans to work closely with a growing number of local faith-based organizations to take the school division to the next level of greatness. Organizations can serve in the areas of volunteerism, mentorships, incentive programs, school events, goods, and monetary service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the breakfasts, guests will have the opportunity to hear from religious leaders and principals who currently partner together.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s says that evangelism isn’t one of the goals here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader admits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, I want religion completely out of my kids’ school. On the other hand, I don’t mind if they want to donate volunteers and goods, as long as we don’t owe them anything for it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know anything about this district.  But it sounds like a well-intentioned, but potentially dangerous plan.  While the religious leaders may have the best of intentions, it’s all too easy for proselytizing to sneak in.  If they want to volunteer or give money, I don’t mind.  But the mentorships and incentive programs? I’d want more information…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of posting something a few days ago, I contacted &lt;strong&gt;Mychael Dickerson&lt;/strong&gt;, the executive director of communications and community outreach for the district, for an explanation of how they know that no church/state violations will occur and which faiths are represented in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what he told me (via email):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for your email and opportunity to respond to your concerns.  &lt;strong&gt;I want to assure you that there is no problem or violation of church and state with the breakfasts we are holding with Faith Based Leaders. We sent invitations to all the churches, mosques, temples listed and that we could find.&lt;/strong&gt; We also reached out to the interfaith organizations to try to reach out as much as possible. We are asking these community members to look for opportunities to tutor, volunteer and to simply partner with our schools.  We do the same for the business community and anyone else who would like to help us provide the best education possible for our kids.  We do a background check on all volunteers and community partners, including those in the faith based community, and we make them go through an orientation.  &lt;strong&gt;The orientation with the faith based partners, includes explaining that they cannot proselytize or recruit for membership to their churches.&lt;/strong&gt; In short, I hope this helps to answer your questions and alleviates any concerns about a violation of the original intent of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Mychael
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still see no attempt to reach out to local Humanist leaders and I let him know that.  But it does sound like the district has taken steps to prevent proselytization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you handle this situation from this point forward?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… produces short documentary videos to demonstrate the explanatory power of simple physical models and to help us understand and aesthetically appreciate the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1BatdOCIk"&gt;first video&lt;/a&gt; discusses the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation"&gt;Cosmic Microwave Background&lt;/a&gt; – a central feature of modern cosmology, and one of our most important tools for exploring the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Lloyd shamelessly follows the well-worn path of other &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/10/09/the-dark-energy-song/"&gt;entertainers&lt;/a&gt; before him in pushing their children – in this case his son Teddy – into the business. Lloyd and Teddy explore what the CMB means on their kitchen table with a pen and paper, cutting to more high-tech descriptions of the material where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s entertaining stuff, while retaining the nice feel of sitting down to an informal chat with an expert. I think you’ll enjoy it and, if so, I hope you’ll return to take a look at their future efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

Yay!]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[UPDATE (for real) 19:45 MDT: The House just postponed voting on the NASA bill. It should get a counted vote later tonight. I'm not sure when.]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;[UPDATE: 3:30 MDT: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gtjqD_BnIXUnLy4eOxjsy14bBOhgD9IHQJ800?docId=D9IHQJ800"&gt;The AP is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the NASA bill passed the House, and will be sent to Obama to sign. I have no other sources for this yet, but it looks real. If so, yay! I'll add that the House was stymied on other important measures due to what looks to me to be more of their eternal and frankly stupid partisan bickering. At least they got the NASA bill done.]&lt;/del&gt; That report is premature, as I had feared. As of 4:45 MDT the bill has not yet been brought up to the Floor. Still waiting…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/05/nasa_logo_thumb.jpg" alt="NASA logo" title="NASA logo" width="200" height="172"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING NEWS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US House of Representatives &lt;a href="http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100928/NEWS02/9280323/1006/NEWS01/Lawmakers+vote+on+NASA+s+direction+tomorrow+"&gt;is slated to vote&lt;/a&gt; on a NASA funding bill WEDNESDAY. The bill is essentially the same the Senate passed recently. &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-nasa-nelson,0,4467296.story"&gt;The House had a compromise bill up for debate&lt;/a&gt;, but decided yesterday there wasn’t time before Congress goes on vacation. So they are going to vote on the Senate version instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows below is some detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick version: &lt;em&gt;I support this bill, and I urge people &lt;a href="http://www.house.gov/zip/ZIP2Rep.html"&gt;to call their Representative&lt;/a&gt; and ask them to vote for it.&lt;/em&gt; I’ve already called my Congressman and asked him to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill, called &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/36380526/U-S-Senate-S-3729-via-MyGov365-com"&gt;&amp;quot;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;del&gt;doles out&lt;/del&gt; authorizes funding for NASA from 2010 – 2013, and advises NASA on what to spend that money on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is the funding: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For fiscal year 2011: $19,000,000,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2012: $19,450,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2013: $19,960,000,000
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the amount goes up every year, an indication that Congress is willing to not only support NASA’s work, but make it sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make this clear right up front: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LONG TERM GOAL. —The long term goal of the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and to do so, where practical, in a manner involving international partners. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stresses human spaceflight, but the bill funds robotic Earth, space, and solar science strongly as well. I can always wish for more funds for unmanned exploration (and have it part of the long-term goal), but the money is there and I’m glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/04/nasa_question.thumbnail.jpg" alt="NASA question" title="NASA question" width="91" height="128"&gt;As for the Shuttle and Constellation, that gets interesting. From what I can tell, this bill axes Constellation. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/04/28/one-nasa-manager-maneuvers-to-save-constellation/"&gt;I support that&lt;/a&gt;, as I have all along. I think that some progress has been made in a follow-on rocket system, but Constellation is bogged down, over budget, and behind schedule. There are lots of reasons for that, but the bottom line is that while some things have been learned, the rocket system itself will take far too long and cost far too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this bill Constellation is gone and new system is required. I like that, but then the bill goes into details of what this new system should do — like how much payload it can carry into orbit, and so on. I’m not thrilled with that. I think Congress should give general goals and leave the details to NASA experts. The bill does mention the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth asteroids, so that makes me happy. There are indeed bottom-line requirements to explore these three goals, but the bill doesn’t need to delineate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Shuttle, I am not thrilled to see that &lt;a href="http://science.house.gov/press/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=2926"&gt;the bill supports the Shuttle through fiscal year 2011&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know if that’s really necessary given the current launch manifest, and I have a sneaky suspicion it’s a jobs program to keep NASA people employed. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to see them employed, but it should be done the right way. Immediate funding to move their expertise to the new launch system might be a better way to do this. But again, this is just a suspicion of mine, and certainly not enough to detract from the rest of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, overall I think the bill does the right thing here. It also reinforces NASA’s commitment to private launch vehicles, which is critical. SpaceX is on the thin edge of getting &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/04/space-x-to-launch-falcon-9-at-1500-ut-today/"&gt;their Falcon 9 rocket&lt;/a&gt; capable of flights to the space station, and they need to influx of funding to keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of ISS, the bill also support it to 2020. As I have said many times, I am not a huge fan of the station, but it’s built now, and it would be a waste of money to let it lie fallow. It costs far less now to do things with it than it did to build it, so we can continue to work on it and perhaps get some good science and knowledge out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of smaller projects supported in the bill — I was surprised and happy to see support for &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/18/researching-at-the-edge-of-space/"&gt;a suborbital research program&lt;/a&gt;, as well as restarting the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator"&gt;radioisotope thermoelectric generator&lt;/a&gt; program to supply power to deep space science missions — but I’m not too concerned over those as yet. The important bits are about supporting science, supporting manned missions, and doing both the right way. Defunding Constellation, restarting the follow-on launch system, and putting money into science is the right way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, I support this bill in general, and think the House should pass it. Mind you, Friday is the last day for session; after that everyone goes home to start campaigning. As things stand now, &lt;em&gt;NASA has no budget and no future.&lt;/em&gt; The House &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; pass this bill if NASA is to get the funding it needs. The fiscal year ends on Thursday! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask that you &lt;a href="http://www.house.gov/zip/ZIP2Rep.html"&gt;contact your Representative&lt;/a&gt; and ask them to vote yes on this bill. Say it by name: S.3729, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. That way you can be clear. From what I understand, it needs a 2/3 majority to pass, so it needs every vote it can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my part, I’ll try to stay up on this news as it occurs Wednesday. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This little white flower can protect itself...in a major way. Alpine pennycress, a dandelion-looking plant found growing in the dirt next to former mines can absorb metal and use it to shield itself from disease, says a recent study in PLoS Pathogens. Why are we always so surprised to witness a seemingly primitive plant or animal adapting to things in post-industrial human societies? It&amp;#39;s their world, too.

Anyway, back to the story--Zinc, nickel, or cadmium, if sucked up in high enough quantity and stored in Alpine pennycress leaves, can prevent growth of the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. 50 different strains of Pseudomonas syringae thrive in the plant world,  and each infect a different plant, leaving characteristic brown spots  where the bacteria digests the leaf. Alpine pennycress has the (so far unique) ability to tuck away metals right where Pseudomonas infiltrates the plant: in the spaces in-between its leaf cells where water and solutes are transported across the leaf (called the apoplast.) Exactly how the metal stamps out the bacteria is unknown. 

For this study, scientist injected an increasing amount of metal into the leaf apoplast to test if the metal affected host-pathogen rendezvous. It very much did: the more metal, the less Pseudomonas. Scientists also created Pseudomonas syringae mutants resistant to zinc, nickel, or cadmium which thrived on Alpine pennycress in comparison to regular Pseudomonas syringae. Cool double check.

So, if you&amp;#39;re a human you might ask--what the h can we use this for?  

A 2003 report mentions Alpine pennycress as a plant with bioremediation potential, along with about 400 other plants that remove heavy metals from soil. Can we use plants and microbes to clean up our messes? Yes. We can. Some scientist propose to use hydrocarbon-consuming microbes to clean up Deepwater Horizon in the gulf.  In the future, could we simply plant sweet little white flowers everywhere to remove contaminates from drinking water around former mining sites? Maybe. But, let us not forget that we are adapting other species, and that has all kinds of consequences, too (I&amp;#39;m not trying to get all environmentalist, here, I&amp;#39;m just saying--take the science all the way.)

Armored flowers. Very 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Off topic, but I wonder if any of the profs will comment on Emma Thompson's prescriptivist rant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20100928/906/ten-emma-thompson-says-youngsters-poor-l.html"&gt;http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20100928/906/ten-emma-thompson-says-youngsters-poor-l.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently "ain't", "like" and "innit" make you sound stupid, and we need to reinvest in the idea of, um, as it were, articulacy, as a form of human freedom and power.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least Pflaumbaum warned us that it was off topic. Anyway, go ahead and follow the link to read the story about Emma Thompson. It's very, very short. I'll be here waiting, below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise Pflaumbaum (and perhaps other readers as well) to find that I am not in the least bit disturbed or troubled by Thompson's "rant". It seems perfectly reasonable to me. Here's what I hear Thompson saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that certain elements of teenage speech bother her (that it "drives [her] insane", she says, which is perhaps a little over the top but not an uncommon use of hyperbole in these sorts of circumstances),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that she is probably not alone in her opinion, at least among folks of a certain age and with a certain status (and I'm inclined to trust her on that one, given her age and status),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that talking with your young friends is not the same as talking with people of a certain age and with a certain status (this is just self-evidently true),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that teenagers should consider the following: "There is the necessity to have two languages - one that you use with your mates and the other that you need in any official capacity. Or you're going to sound like a knob".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, the &amp;quot;knob&amp;quot; part is again a bit hyperbolic — but crucially, she says &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re going to &lt;i&gt;sound like&lt;/i&gt; a knob", not "you're going to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a knob&amp;quot;. If there&amp;#39;s any doubt of the distinction I&amp;#39;m making here, consider this quote from Thompson: &amp;quot;it makes you sound stupid and you&amp;#39;re not stupid&amp;quot;. Clearly, what Thompson&amp;#39;s saying here is that there are social implications to the choices we make when we speak, and that we&amp;#39;re all well-served to consider those implications — even though they don&amp;#39;t match up with reality. This is descriptivism, pure and simple, and not a &amp;quot;prescriptivist rant&amp;quot; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that I did file this under "Prescriptivist Poppycock", and I believe that's still appropriate.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Baković</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285698939116"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=16648">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4cc32ad17eef29cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Reviews"/><title type="html">The Man From Earth, or Paleolithic Forrest Gump: A Review</title><published>2010-09-28T17:55:57Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T17:55:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/09/the-man-from-earth-or-paleolithic-forrest-gump-a-review/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I am hip and cool and up on all the latest atheist thingies, I just watched &lt;em&gt;The Man From Earth&lt;/em&gt;, a movie (from *cough*2007*cough*) that was recommended to me by, well, every atheist I know. I didn’t bother to find out anything about the plot before watching – I assumed I’d love it because all my friends loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man you guys, did I hate it. I’m thinking of shopping for new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you all begin to pour your anger into the comment form, please! Allow me to explain! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heads up, kids: there will be spoilers. I’ll try to call them out as I go but the big one is sort of the whole plot of the movie so I can’t avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, there were only four things wrong with this movie, and they were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad production values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad acting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad storyline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take them in order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Bad Production Values&lt;br&gt;
I can overlook the first problem for an otherwise good story, but I wanted to mention it because it’s really pretty terrible in this movie. The audio is badly dubbed and I know nothing about cameras but I do know that you should probably either use one that works in low light or not bother having scenes that take place in dimly lit rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Bad Acting&lt;br&gt;
I’m willing to forgive the second, since the actors are saddled with clunky dialogue and witless witticisms with subject-verb and pronoun problems. So I’ll just jump right to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Bad Writing&lt;br&gt;
Things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Oldman: Believe in what He tried to teach without the rigmarole. Piety is not what the lessons bring to people, it’s the mistakes they bring to the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Oldman: I had a chance to sail with Columbus, only I’m not the adventurous type. I was pretty sure the earth was round, but at that point I still thought he *might* fall off an edge some place.&lt;br&gt;
The Group: [incredulous looks all around the room]&lt;br&gt;
Art: Look around John, we just did!&lt;br&gt;
Me: &lt;em&gt;You just did what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Gruber: [climax of the movie requiring the channeling of vast amounts of pathos]: What was our dog’s name?&lt;br&gt;
John: Woofie&lt;br&gt;
Dr Gruber: [beating breasts and crying] WOOOOOOFFFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&lt;br&gt;
Me: LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/SPOILER ALERT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the time or energy to rewatch the film, I’d gladly list a dozen more examples, but I’ll just move on to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Bad Storyline&lt;br&gt;
Here’s where I have to give away the main plot point, so turn back now if you want to remain blissfully ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Oldman is leaving town, and at his going away party he informs his university colleagues that he has been alive for about 14,000 years. Not only that, but he’s met pretty much everybody, like some kind of Paleolithic Forrest Gump: Picasso, the Buddha, that guy who painted the caves at Lascaux – you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the topic turns to religion. John doesn’t want to talk about it, because in 14,000 years he’s learned that it’s impolite at parties to discuss religion or politics. OH AND ALSO BECAUSE HE’S JESUS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn’t exactly come as a shock to me, since by this point I knew that 1. atheists love this movie and 2. the storyline was as subtle as a brick to the face, so I pretty much figured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other party attendees is a grumpy old lady who also happens to be a Christian, and just on the saner side of being a Biblical literalist. Her job here as a character is to be one-dimensional and cry a lot while saying things like “Say it isn’t true!” over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John explains that he’s not the son of God, just some guy who wanted to pass along the Buddha’s teachings. I guess this is why atheists like this movie? Because Jesus is just some guy? But . . . he’s also a supernatural being who is ostensibly immortal. Oh and he says that the Old Testament totally sucked but the New Testament was all happy love, which makes me wonder why in all this time he never bothered to read the books that were supposedly written about him. Like Matthew 15:22-26, where a Canaanite woman begs Jesus for help and he calls her a dog. NICE, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jesushaiti.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="jesus haiti" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jesushaiti-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And that brings me to my biggest criticism of the movie: it would have been so much bolder and more interesting if the screenwriter had embraced John as an unsympathetic character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the conversation at the party revolves around the fact that John has to move on every ten years when people begin to notice that he doesn’t age. There’s a girl at the party who tells him that she’s in love with him. He admits he’s fond of her (and sexually attracted to her) but that’s it, and he’d just move on in ten years again. She basically says, “Good enough!” She’s completely one-dimensional as well, so I can only assume that she has incredibly low self-esteem, and John is going to hit that so hard. Why? Because he’s Jesus and he &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m going to have to spoil the last obvious “twist” at the end of the movie, so you may want to avert your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the party attendees is an old psychiatrist (Dr Gruber) whose wife has just died so he unconvincingly pulls a gun on John because he’s angry? I guess? At the end of the movie, John is on the porch with the piece of tail laughing about some of the stupid names he’s had to make up in the past. Dr Gruber overhears one and realizes that John was his dad. Then the conversation I quoted above happens (WOOOOFFIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEE!). Gruber whines that John abandoned their family. John says, “Yeah, sorry about that.” Then Gruber keels over and dies. I think this all happens over the course of maybe a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialogue is laughable (WOOOOFFIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEE!) but this was probably the best opportunity for the movie to be something interesting, or at least thought-provoking. What does an immortal do when confronted with the death of a son he abandoned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you what he does: hops in his truck with Candypants, smiles, and takes off for a new town. THE END&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident wasn’t long enough or powerful enough to make John into a complex character. He’s still supposed to be likable, and I think we’re even supposed to feel sorry for him because he can’t settle down for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccawatson/status/25749489897"&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last night about my feelings on the film, a few people responded to say they enjoyed it as a long &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jjuliano/statuses/25751327537"&gt;Outer Limits&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Mimekiller/statuses/25750901968"&gt;Twilight Zone&lt;/a&gt;-style show. I agree that had this been a 20-minute episode of the Twilight Zone, I’d have been pretty happy with it, and I probably would have wished it could be expanded into a full movie. But then I would assume that the other 70 minutes would be full of actual character development instead of more stilted dialogue and senseless banter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s a fairly thorough wrap-up of my thoughts the day after seeing it. Since I know a lot of you have seen it and loved it, I’d like to hear your thoughts on why you enjoyed it. Obviously people have different tastes, but I wonder how many people enjoyed this movie simply because we don’t see a lot of movies that deal with religious themes like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I wanted to end this review by recommending a better movie in this vein, but I’m honestly stumped. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285698571129"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=43769">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f48514bb4c811f82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="agriculture"/><category term="food"/><title type="html">Unscrambling the Egg Disaster</title><published>2010-09-28T18:00:20Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T18:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/jzqGYJGFjkc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/unscrambling-the-egg-disaster/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">If there's a winner in the recent recall of 550 million eggs potentially infected with salmonella enteritidis, it's your local egg farmer.  Under the assumption that eggs sourced from small, organic, free-range farms are less likely to be contaminated with salmonella, consumers are flocking to farmers' markets and backyard coops in a panicked quest to avoid industrially produced eggs.  According to one newspaper account, shoppers are increasingly willing to pay up to $3.50 for a dozen eggs in order to have "a direct link to their food." But I wonder: does this make any sense?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/jzqGYJGFjkc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By JAMES MCWILLIAMS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285698008344"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=202174">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e0e05db328b1108e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="food addiction"/><category term="food industry"/><category term="Jackie Warner"/><category term="nutrition"/><category term="obesity"/><category term="personal trainers"/><category term="Thintervention"/><category term="This Is Why You're Fat"/><category term="weight loss"/><category term="working out"/><title type="html">This Is Why You're Fat: Who Do You Think Is Responsible for Overweight Americans?</title><published>2010-09-28T18:14:26Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T18:14:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/is-this-why-youre-fat-who-do-you-think-is-responsible-for-overweight-americans/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Thintervention" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2010/09/Thintervention-490x318.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="318"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a slight &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/move/and-my-newfound-obsession-with-bravos-thintervention-continues/"&gt;obsession with the new show &lt;em&gt;Thintervention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Bravo&lt;/em&gt;’s answer to &lt;em&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/em&gt;. So when we spotted a &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2020189,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-sidebar"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Jackie Warner&lt;/a&gt;, our new favorite trainer (and author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Youre-Thin-Forever-More/dp/044654860X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is Why You’re Fat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), we were all ears. As you might expect, she had some interesting things to say in response to &lt;em&gt;TIME &lt;/em&gt;magazine’s question about why people are overweight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#888888"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Thintervention&lt;/em&gt;, you tell people, “It’s not your fault that you’re fat, it’s your fault that you’re staying that way.” What do you mean by that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The food industry largely conspires to keep America fat. They want to feed us food that gets us fat and keeps us that way. If you follow what they tell you to do, you’ll gain weight. So it isn’t your fault. But once you have the tips, the tools and the information necessary to take control of your own life — take control of what you ingest — then it’s your fault if you knowingly ingest those things and stay fat. If you simply take control, become a good consumer and make smarter choices, then obviously you won’t stay fat. The pounds can and will come off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree that it’s everyone’s responsibility to be a smart consumer, but are we the only ones who find this logic a little convoluted? So the food industry makes us fat. But we should be able to outsmart the food industry. But that’s only after they make us fat. And who, exactly, is responsible for educating us about taking control of our own life (and what we ingest)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that Warner’s ideas about the food industry conspiring to make us fat are correct? Who do you think is to blame for making so many Americans overweight and obese? Let us know in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

We keep being told we're know-nothings who are simply unaware of the great stuff that believers actually believe, yet somehow, these defenders of the faithful never quite manage to continue their train of thought and tell us what those great ideas are. So he has issued a &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/09/challenge-to-theists-and-their.html"&gt;simple challenge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I challenge all theists and all their accommodationist friends to post their very best 21st century, sophisticated (or not), arguments for the existence of God. They can put them in the comments section of this posting, or on any of the other atheist blogs, or on their own blogs and websites. Just send me the link.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Try and make it concise and to the point. It would be nice if it's less than 100 years old. Keep in mind that there are over 1000 different gods so it would be helpful to explain just which gods the argument applies to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be looking forward to the replies, if I wasn't confident that what he'll get instead is a lot of evasions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/show_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/zPiiHRIVRfI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285691766423"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/for_the_teachers_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0832ef9332ed0c64</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academics"/><title type="html">For the teachers</title><published>2010-09-28T17:22:34Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T17:22:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BPIuK4n3bPk/for_the_teachers_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/for_the_teachers_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RxsOVK4syxU?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He's very quick. It's too bad he isn't rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Myers,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My paper, "The Origin of the Vertebrate Skeleton," published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, does not describe what is observed in embryology. I never made this claim. The references in the paper illustrate and support the historical context. Namely, attempts to represent in drawings the missing historical stages lost by the phenomenon called condensation (the attrition of initial stages by the addition of terminal stages over eons, see Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Stephen Jay Gould, 1977).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By analogy this phase is the reconstruction of a missing first reel of a long movie. The model is a hypothetical construction, common in cosmology, geology and atomic theory, to account for historical or unobservable events. It is the only accurately predictive model of morphogenesis ever published.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For further explanation my proposed model, see: &lt;a href="http://www.syntheticlifelab.com"&gt;www.syntheticlifelab.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sincerely yours,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stuart Pivar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know those drawings could not be derived from embryology, because nothing in the embryo resembles them. But that disclaimer still leaves wide open a significant question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is the evidence for his "reconstruction"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not in embryology, it's not in molecular biology, it's not in systematics, it's not in paleontology. It's just, boom, plopped on the page in a series of fantastic sketches. If you're doing science, the central part of any paper is a description of &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; you derived your conclusions, and that is completely missing. With that level of rigor, &lt;a href="http://www.worldoffroud.com/index.html"&gt;Brian Froud's books&lt;/a&gt; could be called scientific evidence for the existence of fairies and goblins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/stuart_pivar_has_replied_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xLYRZ7CdpWg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1285690872474"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/when_i_was_much_younger.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0aab42fce9cbea0f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">When I was much younger…</title><published>2010-09-28T16:27:38Z</published><updated>2010-09-28T16:27:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/QF4difBEqYY/when_i_was_much_younger.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/when_i_was_much_younger.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The local newspaper would print out the names of all of the kids who made it onto the school honor roll, and my grandma would pinch my cheek and tell me what a good boy I was for studying hard.

Congratulations to them both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessie Little Doe Baird is a linguist who is reviving a long-silent  language and restoring to her Native American community a vital sense of  its cultural heritage. Wampanoag (or Wôpanâak), the Algonquian language  of her ancestors, was spoken by tens of thousands of people in  southeastern New England when seventeenth-century Puritan missionaries  learned the language, rendered it phonetically in the Roman alphabet,  and used it to translate the King James Bible and other religious texts  for the purposes of conversion and literacy promotion. As a result of  the subsequent fragmentation of Wampanoag communities in a land  dominated by English speakers, Wampanoag ceased to be spoken by the  middle of the nineteenth century and was preserved only in written  records. Determined to breathe life back into the language, Baird  founded the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, an intertribal effort  that aims to return fluency to the Wampanoag Nation. She undertook  graduate training in linguistics and language pedagogy at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked with the late  Kenneth Hale, a scholar of indigenous languages, to decipher grammatical  patterns and compile vocabulary lists from archival Wampanoag  documents. By turning to related Algonquian languages for guidance with  pronunciation and grammar, this collaboration produced a 10,000-word  Wampanoag-English dictionary, which Baird continues to develop into an  essential resource for students, historians, and linguists alike. In  addition to achieving fluency herself, she has adapted her scholarly  work into accessible teaching materials for adults and children and  leads a range of educational programs—after-school classes for youth,  beginning and advanced courses for adults, and summer immersion camps  for all ages—with the goal of establishing a broad base of Wampanoag  speakers. Through painstaking research, dedicated teaching, and  contributions to other groups struggling with language preservation,  Baird is reclaiming the rich linguistic traditions of indigenous peoples  and preserving precious links to our nation’s complex past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie Little Doe Baird received an M.Sc. (2000) from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has served as the co-founder  and director of the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project in Mashpee,  Massachusetts, since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.6241263/k.7598/Carol_Padden.htm"&gt;Carol Padden&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Padden is a linguist whose research focuses on the unique  structure and evolution of sign languages—how they differ from spoken  language and from each other—and on the specific social implications of  signed communication. Sign languages, with rare exceptions, are not  transliterations of a voiced language but rather have internal structure  with their own vocabulary, syntax, and grammar (e.g., using  placeholders in visual space and movement of signs to convey subject,  object, and verb). In her early research on American Sign Language,  Padden clarified misconceptions about the grammatical use of visual  space, showing, for example, how signers use points in space to refer to  different subjects. More recently, Padden and colleagues determined  that Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL), a new sign language, makes  greater use of the signer’s own body to show the subject of the verb, as  opposed to using space in front of the signer. Although the various  sign languages in use around the world are relatively young and rapidly  developing, Padden and her colleagues have demonstrated that emerging  languages, even if not yet mature, can nonetheless quickly adopt complex  grammatical structures such as grammatical subject and word order,  calling into question long-held beliefs about natural language  progressing from simple to complex. Much of Padden’s work also focuses  on the social context of signed languages, such as language acquisition  and evolution in culturally and geographically diverse populations  (e.g., Israeli Sign Language) versus isolated, tight-knit communities  (e.g., ABSL). She also writes extensively about historical factors  impacting the development and use of sign language, contemporary  obstacles to interaction and integration of deaf culture within larger  society, and the underappreciated heterogeneity within deaf cultures  (such as the different ways in which deaf people learn sign language and  interact with other deaf people). Through her fundamental linguistics  research and her reflections on the relationship between language and  culture, Padden demystifies sign language and opens windows of  understanding regarding how languages evolve over time and the role of  language in building and maintaining communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol Padden received a B.S. (1978) from Georgetown University and a  Ph.D. (1983) from the University of California, San Diego, where she is  currently a professor in the Department of Communication and associate  dean for the Division of Social Sciences. Her publications include the  co-authored volumes &lt;em&gt;Deaf in America: Voices from a Culture&lt;/em&gt; (1988), &lt;em&gt;Inside Deaf Culture&lt;/em&gt; (2005), two textbooks on American Sign Language, and scholarly articles in such journals as &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first year, the award went to author &lt;strong&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/02/26/what-do-salman-rushdie-and-the-lead-singer-of-bad-religion-have-in-common/"&gt;second award&lt;/a&gt; went to lead singer of Bad Religion, &lt;strong&gt;Greg Graffin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third award went to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/13/joss-whedon-on-humanism/"&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the man behind the TV shows &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dollhouse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/04/the-2010-outstanding-lifetime-achievement-award-in-cultural-humanism-goes-to/"&gt;it went&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adam Savage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Hyneman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a pattern…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of testosterone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’d love to see a woman receive the award.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case, who do you think should be in the running to win the award this year?  Feel free to suggest more than one name.  The nominating committee is paying attention to your suggestions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s that, you say? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want an incentive?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll pick a random commenter from among all nominees and you’ll win a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/strong&gt;‘ brand new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439171211?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1439171211"&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!  (It’s not even out until October 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest is only open to US residents (Sorry — publisher’s rules). If you’d like to enter, just insert the word “Hippo” at the end of your comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: The committee writes in a comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We just wanted to clarify a little bit what the award is about. The key words here are “Cultural Humanism.” I realize that’s a bit vague, but the idea is, this award is for people in the Arts – hence why our previous winners are an author, a musician, and 3 TV personalities. We look for nominees who contribute to Humanism by (a) popularizing it via their own popularity and (b) having their values reflected in their art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rules out, for the most part, scientists and “famous for being atheist” type writers (including the awesome Mr. Mehta himself.) It’s not that we don’t love these people to death – trust me, we do – but there are already several awards out there for that sort of thing. In fact, many of the people suggested above have gotten such awards in recent years from the AHA (Lori Lipman Brown, Eugenie Scott, Annie Laurie Gaylor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: keep this in mind as you throw out suggestions! We’re already hard at work on this year’s nominees, but we’ll be watching this space closely for new ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as for the “too much testosterone” thing: It’s certainly on our radar as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much love to all of you fine internet folks,&lt;br&gt;
The Cultural Humanism Award Committee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Our research suggests that Rachel Maddow is not necessarily nonreligious. Anyone have proof to the contrary?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anyone else going? Contact me by email so we can get together. Maybe food and beverages on Thursday evening? (My address is at the top of the left sidebar.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of Montréal is on a large island in the middle of the St. Lawrence river. The site was occupied by the St. Lawrence Iroquois when the first Europeans arrived in the 1530's. They had established a large village called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochelaga_%28village%29"&gt;Hochelaga&lt;/a&gt; but this village was largely deserted by the time Europeans constructed the first settlement in 1611.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; My ancestor, Barthélemy Montarras, was a soldier in the Compagnie Froment, Le régiment de Carignan, based in Montréal around 1665. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKIJhF-kpwI/AAAAAAAAKxg/UGrQydUPcIM/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:269px;height:400px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKIJhF-kpwI/AAAAAAAAKxg/UGrQydUPcIM/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The dominant feature of the city is Mont Royal (Mount Royal) a group of hills right in the middle of Montréal island. The hills were first scaled by Jacques Cartier in 1535. A wooden cross was erected in 1635. The giant illuminated cross that we see today was built in 1924.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Montréal has several half-decent universities but, more importantly, it has many excellent bistros and cafés. I hope to try several of them this weekend. There are some special dishes that you just can&amp;#39;t get in Toronto—or if you can get them, they&amp;#39;re not nearly as good. It&amp;#39;s sad that some of my friends won&amp;#39;t be able to sample the smoked meat or the poutine due to restrictions imposed by their doctor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKILMtrPqaI/AAAAAAAAKxo/z_zwHO02dCs/s1600/tmp.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:144px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TKILMtrPqaI/AAAAAAAAKxo/z_zwHO02dCs/s400/tmp.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;Over at Uncommon Descent (in
&lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/a-simple-statistical-test-for-the-alleged-99-genetic-identity-between-humans-and-chimps/" rel="external "&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;)
“niwrad” presents a calculation, lengthily
explained, showing that the assertion that
human and chimp genomes differ by 1% in their
base sequence is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What “niwrad” does is extraordinary.  Choosing
random places in one genome (doing this
separately for each chromosome) “niward” takes
30-base chunks, and then looks over into the
other genome to see whether or not there is a
perfect match of all 30 bases.   This turns out to
occur between 41.60% of the time and 69.06%
of the time in autosomes (it varies from chromosome
to chromosome).   The median is about 65%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the difference is really 35%, not 1%, right?
Not so fast.   If two sequences differ by 1.23% (the
actual figure from the chimp genome paper), a one-base
chunk will match 98.77% of the time.   A two-base chunk
will perfectly match (0.9877 x 0.9877) of the time.   And so
on.   A 30-base chunk will match a fraction of the time which
is the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power of 0.9877.   That’s  0.6898 of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the 65% figure is pretty close to what is expected from
a difference of 1.23% at the single-base level.  However the
penny hasn’t dropped yet over there (as of this writing, anyway).
One commenter (“CharlesJ”) has asked whether there isn’t
about a 1 in 4 chance of a 30-base mismatch if the difference
is really 1%.  That’s correct, and “niwrad” has (somewhat
incorrectly) replied that it’s actually 1 in 3.   This is a bit wrong
but one way or the other the whole article goes up in smoke.
“niwrad” has not figured that out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course what creationists &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; do when they get upset
about the 1% figure and claim it is Much Higher Than That
is to compare that figure with the percentage difference with
the orang genome or the rhesus macacque genome (gorilla
isn’t available yet).  Those are of course higher yet, no matter
how you calculate the figure, leaving the chimp as our closest
relative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night Lisa Murkowski announced she would mount a write-in campaign to retain her Senate seat, she acknowledged to a crowd of supporters that her odds were slim. Then she prompted a defiant roar: invoking Native Alaskan culture, she told the crowd that the ancient Aleut language contained no word for "impossible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the crowd roar, but made me put my hand on my wallet, to make sure it was still there, as I always do when someone tells me that language &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; has no word for concept &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; (I have grown used to such claims always being unadulterated bullshit). But then — a surprise! — the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a deft play to the state's strong sense of identity and a direct appeal to native communities, whose support could prove crucial. It was also inaccurate. The word in Aleut is haangina-lix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's very clear that you can say ‘impossible,‘ " said Gary Holton, the director of the Alaska Native Language Archive.  "Clearly, she wasn't checking her facts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact checking!  On a point about language!  Kudos to the the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.  Champagne will be served in the Senior Writers' Lounge at One Language Log Plaza at 5 this afternoon to celebrate this unusual and praiseworthy sign of interest in linguistic accuracy in the journalistic profession.  We are most encouraged, and we salute William Yardley, the reporter who wrote the story.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: An alert commenter below points out that Gary Holton put the remark about Aleut &lt;a href="http://talkingalaska.blogspot.com/2010/09/murkowski-refers-to-aleut-language.html"&gt;on his blog on September 18&lt;/a&gt;, so Yardley might just have picked it up from there initially.  He does appear to have called the Alaska Native Language Archive for a quote, however.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published on &lt;a href="http://www.lemondrop.com/2010/09/28/are-women-more-polite/"&gt;Lemondrop&lt;/a&gt; by Emily Tan, and we thought you’d like it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s bumping into someone when getting on the train to stopping  an argument with a significant other, it seems that women are always the  first ones to say “I’m sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of us are just being knee-jerk polite, two new studies  actually suggest that we’re more likely to apologize in most situations  than men — only not for the reasons you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=women-apologize-more-frequently-tha-10-09-25"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;, take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study that monitored the conversations of 66 male and female subjects  over the course of a 12-day period found that women said “sorry”  significantly more often than men. However, researchers who also asked  subjects to report mistakes and offenses they’d made during that time  period discovered that women reported more than their male counterparts.  Translation: It’s not that women over-apologize, it’s just that we  commit more gaffes.&lt;/p&gt;

Alston’s &lt;em&gt;Perceiving God: The Epistemology of Religious Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at EvolutionBlog, Jason Rosenhouse discusses&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/09/swinburne_on_god_part_one.php#more"&gt; his take on Swinburne’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/09/swinburne_on_god_part_one.php#more"&gt;Existence of God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  (He &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; read it, by the way.)  Jason has a Ph.D. in mathematics with plenty of training in probability (see his book on the Monty Hall problem), so he’s well equipped to analyze what seems to be a Bayesian approach to proving God.  Jason’s verdict? Thumbs down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have read my share of Swinburne, however, including &lt;em&gt;The Existence of God.&lt;/em&gt; I fear he had the opposite effect on me from what Coyne’s correspondent described. It is not anything I learned from the fundamentalists that has driven me to my generally negative opinion of theology and the philosophy of religion. It is people like Swinburne who did that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an assessment of Swinburne’s work as a whole; go read the post for his comments on the book.  This seems to be the first of a series of posts that Jason will publish on Swinburne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still going to read &lt;em&gt;The Existence of God&lt;/em&gt;, but judging by the comments of those who have already read it, I’m not expecting a slam-dunk proof of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that Richard Dawkins has published, as a&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/a-philosopher-says-were-doing-it-rong/"&gt; comment (# 56) on that thread&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; review of a book by Swinburne.&lt;/p&gt;

A gunman who fired several shots in the Perry-Castaneda Library on the UT campus is dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound and police are looking for a possible second suspect, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo confirmed that the shooter is dead, but UT continues to be locked down, and people are urged to stay out of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say it appears there are no other injuries. UT spokeswoman Rhonda Weldon said witnesses had reported that the man was armed with automatic weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shooter is dead on the sixth floor of Perry-Castaneda Library, said Don Hale, a UT spokesman. “No identification. Apparently took his own life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any report of anybody getting shot at this point,” Hale said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not clear yet” if there is a second suspect, Hale said shortly after 9 a.m., adding that the university’s advice to stay indoors and keep doors locked remains in force.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police officials raised the possibility of a second gunman because they had received different descriptions of the gunman by witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unclear how many shots were fired, but witnesses described eight to 10 shots in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were numerous reports that the gunman was wearing a black ski mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KVUE talked to UT student Andrew McWaters who said he saw the shooter near Dobie Mall and heard four gunshots followed by two more. He said the gunman was wearing a black ski mask, smiling and waving the gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hale said university officials at 8:23 a.m. alerted students, faculty members and staff members by text message, outdoor loudspeakers and an online posting to stay indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second e-mail alert from UT officials said: “Armed subject last seen at Perry Casteneda Library and UTC. Shelter in place. UTPD responding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That seems to be working pretty well,” Hale said of that advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency sirens began going off about 8:30 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. from Red River Street to University Avenue is closed at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Austin SWAT team accompanied by DPS troopers are on the scene.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alicia Dietrich, public affairs assistant with the Harry Ransom Center, which is down the street from the library, said she heard the shots as she was parking her bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t even know for sure that it was gunshots,” Dietrich said at 8:47 a.m. “The sirens went off about five to 10 minutes ago. The building has been locked down and I don’t think they’re letting anybody in or out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Olsen, a graduate student at the University of Texas, said he was walking by the Dobie dorm about 8:15 a.m. when he heard about eight to 10 shots in short bursts. He said other people walking to class also heard shots and were looking around “kind of in awe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UT facilities worker told KLBJ-AM that he heard at least 10 gunshots but saw nobody get hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jamie did an excellent job summarizing many of the key points discussed and adds his own perspective as well. Here’s an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the women panelists discussed the topics on the agenda, I began to  realize that the success of women in science is not just a women’s  issue.  It’s an American issue.  It became apparent that America is  surely missing out on some significant scientific minds.  These minds  and their potential contributions to the world of science belong to  women who have been driven out of science simply because they wish to  fulfill the duty that only women can fulfill: motherhood.  Seemingly,  the most significant distinction between women and men is woman’s  ability to bring life into this world.  And, unfortunately, the demands  of that job can be just too much for today’s scientific lifestyle.  So,  for the sake of humanity, many women are forced to make the choice to  leave the field of science.  And when you consider the women sitting on  this panel; Pr. Sara Seager, Ellen Swallow Richards, Professor of  Planetary Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Pr. Joan  Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry,  Yale University, Dr. Shirley Malcom, Head of Education and Human  Resources, American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS),  Russlynn Ali, Assistant Secretary, Office of Civil Rights, U.S.  Department of Education, it quickly becomes evident that when a  woman  chooses to leave the field of science, she takes with her all the  potential for solving scientific problems that make her such an asset to  the profession.  It is not simply an issue of losing brain power.  It  is also a problem of losing diversity within the problem-solving  community.  Dr. Steitz emphasized that women bring diverse points of  view to science.  Not retaining that diversity diminishes our potential  for curing diseases, developing new technologies and ending global  climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the statistics presented by Russlynn Ali  that demonstrated a pattern of female attrition from science was the  clear message that women just don’t feel comfortable enough in our  current scientific community.  Not only, is this an issue of fairness,  it is also an issue of global competitiveness.  In a world in which  China and India are creating many more scientists and engineers yearly  than America, we will eventually fall behind.  One way we can increase  our ability to compete is to encourage women to participate in the  sciences.  Dr. Seager proposed the first solution to these problems,  stating that this is not an issue of competency for girls, but  confidence.  Young girls are capable of learning science and thinking  scientifically, but they are discouraged from pursuing science at the  earliest ages.  Something must be done to turn this around.  This will  require changes that invite women into the sciences.  Dr. Seager’s  solution is to develop mentorships that support young women as they make  the decision to become scientists.  It will require understanding and  guidance to build within them the confidence they need to join with the  boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a long and thoughtful recap with a lot of important ideas taken further than we had time to explore last Thursday. I encourage everyone to &lt;a href="http://jlvernonphd.tumblr.com/post/1202993726/the-key-to-success-for-women-in-science-is-not-men-but"&gt;go read Jamie’s full post&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s getting really frustrating.  There are lots of interesting facts, followed by M&amp;amp;K baldly asserting the exact opposite of what a reasonable person might conclude from those facts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 4, for example, is about the events that unfolded during the 1990s.  M&amp;amp;K characterize the decade as one of contrasting gains and losses for science.  On one hand, you have a pro-science president, the dot-com boom, and a proliferation of popular science books.  The authors cited by Mooney as being on the forefront of those books are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Carl Sagan... Stephen Hawking... Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennet, Jared Diamond, Richard Feynman, James Gleick, Stephen Jay Gould, Lawrence Krauss, Steven Pinker, and E.O. Wilson&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice anything about that list?  Virtually all of them are well-known to be atheists, and the few who aren't we can mostly infer their atheism from their writing (e.g. given Jared Diamond's comments about the origin of religion in &lt;i&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/i&gt; -- he basically says that religion started as a useful tool for recruiting people to fight and die for your budding nation-state, even when it yields no benefit to them -- it would be difficult to picture him having a kind view of it!).  Two of the list are half of the Four Horsemen, and a few others have made openly hostile comments towards religion (e.g. Krauss, Feynman).  Now you can even add Hawking to the list of those who fail Mooney's "respect" test.  Only a single person on the list -- Gould -- has advocated for faith-science reconciliation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Granted, M&amp;amp;K seem to acknowledge this -- the picture they paint is of these popularizing scientists becoming overconfident (&amp;quot;hubris&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;triumphalism&amp;quot; are two words that are tossed out) and that in turn causing them to make a grave error in criticizing religion.  Then they assert, without any evidence that I&amp;#39;ve been able to find yet:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was also an occasional undercurrent of arrogance and superiority that led the movement in less constructive directions.  The third culture's frequent attacks on religious belief were perhaps most damaging.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, I'll take a &lt;i&gt;single anecdote&lt;/i&gt; at this point which supports the frequent assertion that the Gnu Atheist hostility towards religion has done any damage whatsoever to science.  If Mooney can track down a single religious person who says, "Well! I was all set to accept evolution as fact, but then I read &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, and since Dawkins is such a dick, I became a creationist."  I have yet to hear one person make such a claim!  Oh sure, I've heard plenty of third parties claim, "I am religious and believe in evolution, but Dawkins/Coyne/whoever is a real dick and that makes me sad."  But where is the damage to science?  I still don't see it.  (A related challenge, which again I have yet to hear an answer to, is:  Name one social movement, at any point in history, which was sabotaged because its advocates were too outspoken.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the contrary, I imagine I could mount some evidence that this controversy may have even helped science in the public eye.  At the very least, I can provide anecdotes...  though it is rare, people &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; been won over by the books of the Gnu Atheists.   It is probably not a statistically significant number, but it does happen.  More importantly, perhaps, can we really deny that countless hordes of people read books like &lt;i&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/i&gt; only because they first became interested by the publication of &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;?  (I count myself among that group, FWIW)  I was unable to find any direct sales data, but this &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=selfish+gene&amp;amp;ctab=0&amp;amp;geo=all&amp;amp;date=all&amp;amp;sort=0"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; graph is revealing... a short-lived spike when &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; was first announced, and then continuing unabated since its publication.  Note that the search term "selfish gene" didn't even &lt;i&gt;register&lt;/i&gt; before then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, M&amp;amp;K go on to cite lots of data bout how terribly creationist and anti-science Americans were during those years... but M&amp;amp;K had already provided a much more straightforward explanation for this not two pages earier:  An anti-science Republican-dominated congress led by Newt Gingrich, and a media obsessed with UFO conspiracies and psychics.  Oh fuck, but we can&amp;#39;t blame politicians and the media!  Everybody&amp;#39;s already done that!  Nope, it&amp;#39;s the fucking scientists&amp;#39; fault.  Has to be.  Never mind that we don&amp;#39;t have any data to support that, and our own data that we present even contradicts that.  It&amp;#39;s still the fucking scientists&amp;#39; fault, because we said so, and we think we can sell a book saying that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sigh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My wife had been picking up the book and flipping through it occasionally, and she went straight to chapter 8 -- after which she said, "You're totally right, this guy is a douche."  heh...  So I skipped ahead to Chapter 8, and here are my thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First things first:  The primary reason I got this book was to see for myself if Mooney and Kirshenbaum presented Crackergate honestly.  They did.  All of the relevant details were there.  Sure, their spin was different than mine would be, but it was perfectly valid -- I do not feel they distorted the events at all, they simply presented them in a tone which disapproved of PZ and Cook while sympathizing with the Catholics -- and well, that's no different in principle from me employing a tone that disapproves of the Catholics, sympathizes with Cook, and praises PZ.  I do not find anything worthy of criticism in their recounting of Crackergate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, as soon as they are done with the telling, M&amp;amp;K fall into the usual pattern:  Assert that the cause of science has been irreparably damaged by these events, with no supporting evidence whatsoever.  Did Catholic acceptance of evolution  or general opinion of science have a sudden dip after Crackergate?  Hell, fuck statistics, do M&amp;amp;K have a &lt;i&gt;single anecdote&lt;/i&gt; of a Catholic saying, "I used to just LOVE science!  But then that mean old PZ stabbed a cracker, and now I am a Young Earth Creationist and I am serving on the Texas School Board"?  No they do not.  Not even an &lt;i&gt;anecdote&lt;/i&gt;.  Just assertions that, well, it made people sad, so therefore it must have been bad for science!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure Crackergate made many Catholics very sad.  And we can debate the ethical/moral/philosophical validity of PZ's protest in that light.  PalMD, for instance, has said he found Crackergate "distasteful" even though he seems to agree with the basic point being made.  That's a valid position to hold, and while I think the cracker-killin' was &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;, I respect PalMD&amp;#39;s opinion as well.  But M&amp;amp;K are trying to assert that Crackergate harms the image of science, and that&amp;#39;s a whole other kettle of fish.  That is not just a philosophical position; you need to support that with data!  And they fail to do so -- or at least, if they do, it&amp;#39;s buried in some part of the book I haven&amp;#39;t read.  Meanwhile, they&amp;#39;ve thrown lots of data at me that contradicts their position...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And once again, we can make the exposure argument.  How many people "came for the godlessness, and stayed for the science?"  How many people found Pharyngula because they heard about Crackergate, and then discovered an interest in evolutionary and developmental biology?  Well, I know of &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;at least one blogger&lt;/a&gt; who fits that description...  I don&amp;#39;t have hard numbers here, of course, but neither do Mooney and Kirshenbaum.  So the question is whose speculation you find most plausible, and since M&amp;amp;K have failed to even posit a plausible mechanism or provide a single anecdote, I have trouble taking them seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the rest of Chapter 8 is your usual accomodationist claptrap, and we&amp;#39;ve heard it all before.  &amp;quot;Faith and science must be compatible, because religious scientists do exist!&amp;quot; (never mind that their percentage is much lower than the genuine population, and in any case you cannot make a statistical argument in favor of a philosophical position)  &amp;quot;Look at all these famous historical scientists&amp;quot; - M&amp;amp;K list Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Decartes, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and Boyle - &amp;quot;who were deeply, devoutly religious!&amp;quot; (Never mind that &lt;i&gt;every single one&lt;/i&gt; lived pre-Darwin, which totally doesn't count)  "Scientists are out of step with the average American!" (no shit sherlock, that's what your fucking book is about!  If you want to change the average, then by definition you must be out of step with it.  You don't change the culture by agreeing with the status quo, idiot!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is one long paragraph, however, which I would like to quote in full, because it presents a novel accomodationist argument, not so much directly in favor of faith-science compatibility, but asserting that scientists are as a group less qualified to judge that alleged compatibility -- and yet I think that with a slightly different spin, it's a rather damning argument &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; faith-science compatibility!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meanwhile, there's no question that America's scientific community is far more secular in outlook than the rest of the nation.  A 2007 study revealed that whereas 52 percent of scientists at twenty-one leading U.S. academic institutions claimed to have no religious affiliation, that was true of just 14 percent of the broader U.S. public.  And whereas 15 percent of Americans self-identify as "evangelical" or "fundamentalist," fewer than 2 percent of the surveyed scientists did.  The study also revealed that far more than the general population, scientists tend to come from liberal or nonreligious family backgrounds.  In fact, those scientists in the survey who professed religious beliefs tended to have grown up with them; childhood upbringing was a central factor in separating religious and non-religious scientists.  The authors of the study concluded, "While the general American public may indeed have a less than desirable understanding of science, our findings reveal that academic scientists may have much less experience with religion than many outside the academy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well that just takes the motherfucking cake right there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, we're talking about faith-science compatibility here, right?  And the study reveals that not only are scientists less religious, but that doesn't seem to be a result of abandoning science as a result of religion -- rather, it seems people who are religious are less likely to go into science in the first place.  Almost as if their religious beliefs were "incompatible" with a career in science, hmm?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the conclusion they draw is that since so few scientists were brought up religious, what would they know about faith-science compatibility?!?  Wha?????  What kind of bizarro world are we living in now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the same token, I suppose, we could observe that children who are raised in a non-smoking household are far more likely to grow up to become non-smokers than their counterparts who are raised by one or more smoking parents; therefore non-smokers on average have much less experience with childhood exposure to secondhand smoke; and so we are forced to conclude that non-smokers aren't qualified to talk about the dangers of secondhand smoke!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh wait, that's stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two paragraphs later, M&amp;amp;K make really the only statement that needs to be made on this matter:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific case for rejecting [Young-Earth Creationism, etc.] is indisputable.  But that doesn't make it persuasive to creationists or other religiously motivated evolution skeptics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Correct!  You are right!  No matter how nicely presented the scientific arguments, no matter what "tone" is employed, &lt;i&gt;they don't work&lt;/i&gt;.  And this is why some of us have decided to attack the problem at its source:  Religious motivation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in regards to that struggle, I would like to quote to M&amp;amp;K the words of a certain &lt;a href="http://thebuddhaisnotserious.wordpress.com/2010/06/19/the-curious-case-of-the-youre-not-helping-blog/"&gt;past acquaintance of Mooney's&lt;/a&gt;:  You're Not

rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/iE_XWcNFs1M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/28/the-newest-tiny-threat-to-earth-2010-st3/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sky is big. Searching it for potentially hazard objects like asteroids and comets is hard. The best way to do it? A big ’scope, equipped with a BIG camera, and a wide, wide field of view. That’s just what the Panoramic Survey Telescope &amp;amp; Rapid Response System — &lt;a href="http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/project-status/PS1%20operational.html"&gt;PanSTARRS&lt;/a&gt; — brings to the table. It’s just a prototype, but it has a 1.8 meter ’scope on — wait for it, wait for it — Mount Haleakala, and it sports a 1.4 &lt;strong&gt;giga&lt;/strong&gt;pixel camera. You read that right: 1.4 billion pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It scans the skies looking for threatening objects, and astronomers just announced they have found their first one: 2010 ST3, an asteroid 50 meters (150 feet or so) across. It was found September 16, when it was still 30+ million kilometers (20 million miles) from Earth. &lt;a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/PHO/"&gt;Here’s the object in question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/PHO/PHO-fig1_RGB300-tall.tif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/2010_ST3.jpg" alt="2010_ST3" title="2010_ST3" width="448" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big a threat is this object? Well, not very: there’s &amp;quot;a very slight chance&amp;quot; it will hit Earth in 2098, so I’m not terribly concerned. When astronomers map an orbit of an object, there’s some uncertainty in the measurements. It’s hard to get the exact position of the object, and its motion over a day or two isn’t enough to get a good idea of its trajectory. The farther you try to project where it’ll be in the future, the fuzzier the prediction gets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something like 2010 ST3, there’s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; volume of potential space it might occupy come  2098, and it so happens that the Earth is in that same volume of space at that time. But the Earth is near the edge of the projected position, and as time goes on, and the orbit is better determined, the volume of space the asteroid might be in will shrink. Eventually, what almost always happens is that the Earth winds up outside that volume as our data get better. That’s why the odds of it hitting us are so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/me_meteor_crater1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/09/me_meteor_crater1-300x144.jpg" alt="me_meteor_crater1" title="me_meteor_crater1" width="300" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now, if it did hit us, it would be bad. An object a bit smaller than that carved out &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater"&gt;Meteor Crater&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona, a hole over 1.5 kilometers across (that’s me posing in front of it; click it to get an idea of how big this scar is, and bear in mind the far rim is almost a mile away). An impact by something like that is about the same as exploding a 20 megaton bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news here… let me correct myself: the &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news here is that Pan-STARRS found this thing at all! From that distance, an object this small is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to see, and no other asteroid survey could’ve found it. That means that as time goes on, Pan-STARRS will find lots and lots of threatening objects. And they’re out there whether we look for them or not! So it’s best to find the beasties before they find us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we do find them, we need to keep a really good eye on them. We need accurate orbits, and good statistics, so that we can figure out just how big a threat these guys are. 2010 ST3 is almost certainly benign, at least for the next century. But there are thousands more like it roaming the sky. We don’t get hit very often, but we do get hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who fret about such things, I like to say that this is something to be &lt;em&gt;concerned&lt;/em&gt; about, but not something to &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt; about. Worry accomplishes nothing, but concern means we’re turning our brains to the problem. And that’s the very best way to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;

However, exactly what sort of pterosaurs are present at Cornet has been somewhat uncertain: the Late Jurassic ctenochasmatoid Cycnorhamphus, ornithocheirids and the Early Cretaceous Asian dsungaripterid Dsungaripterus were all reported from the assemblage during the 1980s (e.g., Jurcsák &amp;amp; Popa 1984) but, as with the birds, the remains on which these identification were based aren&amp;#39;t great. In fact, most of the pterosaur bones from Cornet can&amp;#39;t be conclusively identified beyond Pterosauria or Pterodactyloidea, and claims that such taxa as Cycnorhamphus are present can&amp;#39;t be supported (Dyke et al. 2010) [art above by Mark Witton - a Tet Zoo exclusive (err, I think). It shows a group of dsungaripterids hounding an azhdarchid. The illustration is one of many that will appear in Mark&amp;#39;s pterosaur book, currently in preparation. An excerpt is available here].

Within a few days after its release there were some blogs and general eye-rolling about how wrong you have it all and so on, and then - &lt;a href="http://simplythebest.net/sounds/WAV/sound_effects_WAV/sound_effect_WAV_files/crickets_1.wav"&gt;crickets chirping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there can be three reasons why this is so:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) the armies of the Lord are busy with their research and we are soon to be regaled with a stunning, jaw-dropping tome that just shuts us all up, to the point that some of us will convert to the unassailable logic of Christianity (cough, on to number 2) ;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. TCD is not worthy of the effort, and it is insignificant. This would be quite removed from the reality of the publication. Some of the blurbs written by Christians at the time certainly proves otherwise, the mumble and grumble raised by the faithful at the time of publication shows otherwise, and some of the sections, specifically your chapter on animal suffering, are really on the cutting edge of counter-apologetics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Now could it be, heaven forbid, that the third option is more accurate? That there are no significant rebuttals, because .............. gasp! - there are none that hold up to scrutiny? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read very widely, including the Christian and atheist websites available, and I would say that I am up to speed with the best in both camps. And there is nothing out there that makes a dent in TCD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of these books tend to fade after their original impact, but it seems to me as if  TCD is growing in stature, quietly, and while the armies of the faithful have one more thing to dismiss as being insignificant despite its cold rationality. I expected a whole gaggle of apologetic efforts, but so far we have practically nothing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This to me is one more example of how the poor old believer is forced to simply pull up the drawbridge and live in HappyLand, content with "Faith" and all that wonderful pseudo-science, while the rest of the real world passes by. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My renewed congratulations, John, to you and all the contributors to this monolithic work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards, Andre&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-182703644395205741?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
